But the loss of half of them is highly unusual.\n\nThe black rhinos were moved from the Nairobi and Lake Nakuru national parks to a new sanctuary created in Tsavo East national park in an operation announced by Najib Balala, the Kenyan tourism minister and carried out in collaboration with WWF Kenya.\nIn a statement the ministry said its preliminary investigations suggested the rhinos had died of salt poisoning as they tried to adapt to saltier water in their new home. It suspended the ongoing move of other rhinos and said the surviving ones were being closely monitored.\n\"The eight dead rhinos were among those that had been moved to the sanctuary in an initiative to start a new population in line with the National Rhino Conservation and Management Strategy,\" the ministry said. \"This kind of mortality rate is unprecedented in Kenya Wildlife Service operations.\"\n\"A total of 14 rhinos had been planned to be translocated.\nIt was the first time since the 1990s that black rhinos had been moved to Tsavo East, which originally had a population of nearly 2,000, according to Save the Rhino, but now has between 10 and 20.\n\nKahumbu said officials must take responsibility and explain what went wrong. \"Rhinos have died. We have to say it openly when it happens, not a week later or a month later,\" she said. \"Something must have gone wrong, and we want to know what it is.\"\nKenya wants to increase its black rhino population to 2,000 by creating populations in areas that provide the right habitat for the animals to thrive.\nDean said translocation was not as common in Kenya as in other southern African countries, such as Namibia.\n\"In Kenya, they do it every three to four years, whereas other countries are doing them every year,\" she said.\n\"There needs to be a postmortem and we need to look at the whole protocol for translocation.\"\nThe ministry said it had invited an external expert from South Africa to join its investigation and if negligence was found to be a contributory factor disciplinary action would be taken.\n\"We will make the investigation results public as soon as we receive them,\" the statement said.\nAccording to KWS figures, nine rhinos were killed in Kenya last year. In May, three more were shot dead inside a specially protected sanctuary in northern Kenya and had their horns removed. In March, the last male northern white rhino on the planet, an older bull named Sudan, was put down by Kenyan vets after becoming ill.

The suit also accuses a female student of defamation for publicly saying he assaulted her and others. The complaint was filed on August 24 in federal court in Chicago.\nThe suit asks for more than $175,000 in damages.\nThe case against the University states that, in its treatment of the plaintiff in the case, \"UC was motivated by pro-female, anti-male bias that was, at least in part, adopted to refute criticism within the student body and public press that UC was turning a blind eye to female complaints of sexual assault.\"\nThe suit is part of a recent trend of litigation by male students at American universities who claim to have been discriminated against in sexual assault investigations in violation of Title IX, a federal statute that prohibits sex discrimination at colleges and universities that receive federal funding. So far, these claims have generally failed, though last month a federal appeals court ruled in favor of a similar suit against Columbia University.\nThe suit involves two separate allegations of sexual assault against \"John Doe\" filed with the University as Title IX complaints. The first allegation, filed by a female student called \"Jane Roe\" in the lawsuit, was decided in \"John Doe's\" favor in 2014. The second was filed this year by another female student, called \"Jane Doe\" in the lawsuit, over an alleged instance of sexual assault in 2013. \"Jane Doe\" is being sued, along with the University.\nThe student the suit refers to as \"Jane Roe\" said \"John Doe\" assaulted her in the spring of 2014. A College disciplinary hearing in May of that year \"found that the preponderance of the evidence did not support [\"Jane Roe's\"] allegation that [\"John Doe\"] sexually assaulted her,\" according to a letter sent to the plaintiff by former assistant dean of students Kathleen Ford. The letter was included as an exhibit in the suit.\nThe suit alleges that \"Jane Roe\" told other people at the University of Chicago that \"John Doe\" had raped her and that she added his name to the \"Hyde Park List,\" a Tumblr page that listed students it said had committed sexual assault or harassment.\n\"Roe\" is not a defendant in the lawsuit. Instead, the suit points to the University's decision to remove the plaintiff from a physics lab with \"Roe\" after the case had been decided, and its failure to stop her from repeating her allegations, as examples of the University's bias against him as a male student.\nIn May of this year, the plaintiff directed a TAPS-sponsored play called The Bald Soprano, according to an email released as an exhibit in the case. Before the play's debut, flyers were posted on bulletin boards around campus urging people to boycott the show, and a protest was staged near the theater on the play's opening night.\n\"For me, it's about supporting survivors, boycotting events put on by perpetrators of sexual assault, and accountability in RSOs,\" then second-year Emma Maltby, who participated in the protest, said when interviewed by The Maroon at the time.\nAt the protest, students held signs with slogans like \"Support survivors, not perpetrators,\" \"Boycott rapists,\" \"Silence = violence,\" and \"Hold your friends accountable.\" Some protesters also had tape over their mouths, with \"Support survivors\" written on the tape.\nStudents protest in Reynolds Club. Zoe Kaiser\n\nAt the time, protesters would not speak to The Maroon on the record about whether their protest was related to a specific incident or person.\nBefore the protest, the female student called \"Jane Doe\" in the suit tweeted that the director of a TAPS show had assaulted her and other people on campus. The plaintiff's law firm sent her a cease-and-desist order in June, demanding that she stop saying that \"John Doe\" had sexually assaulted her or other people, formally apologize to him, and issue an apology and retraction on social media. As of publication, the original tweet was still posted on \"Jane Doe's\" Twitter account.\nIn May of this year, \"John Doe\" filed a Title IX complaint against \"Jane Doe,\" alleging harassment. Jeremy Inabinet, associate dean of students for disciplinary affairs, told him that the actions he cited did not constitute harassment under University policy and dismissed the allegation.\n\"Jane Doe\" then filed a Title IX complaint in June against \"John Doe,\" saying he had sexually assaulted her in 2013. \"John Doe\" then filed another complaint with the school, saying that \"Jane Doe's\" complaint was in bad faith and retaliation against his decision to file his May complaint and otherwise defend himself against rape allegations. The University initially told \"John Doe\" that it planned to pursue the case against him under the 2015 Student Manual, which had a different definition of consent from the 2013 Student Manual.\nThe suit says that \"it was impossible for John Doe to know whether his consensual physical encounters with Jane Doe in 2013 might violate subsequently created stringent mandates in UC's 2015 Manual.\"\nThe suit also claims that the University failed to respond to public accusations that \"John Doe\" had sexually assaulted people and treated him unfairly by agreeing to hear \"Jane Doe's\" Title IX complaint. The suit includes selected posts from the female defendant's blog which it alleges show that their 2013 encounter was consensual.\nThe suit alleges that the female defendant's comments were defamatory, and claims that she and the University inflicted emotional distress on the plaintiff. It alleges, among other things, that the University of Chicago violated Title IX by creating a hostile environment, selectively enforcing its provisions, and retaliating against \"John Doe\" for defending himself against allegations of sexual assault.\nThe case states that the University's policy for Title IX investigations takes cues from the Department of Education's \"Dear Colleague\" letter, which lays out how Title IX complaints about sexual violence or harassment between students should be handled by school administrations.

", "We cannot risk having Apple or Google foreclose app innovation, integration, distribution or economics.", "\"\nNokia lashed itself to Microsoft's mast after losing out to iOS and Android in the smartphone market share stakes and with the limited success of the Lumia range so far enough to keep interest in Windows Phone alive, most analysts are seeing a certain amount of inevitability to the acquisition, even if they are split on what its biggest implications are.\n", "Forrester mobile analyst Charles Golvin said the steadily diminishing investments by other Windows Phone licensees has left Microsoft with just Nokia as its standard bearer and added Microsoft now appears \"poised to adopt a vertically integrated strategy more akin to Apple's\".\n", "But he said Microsoft's challenge remains how to unite the myriad services and brands - Windows, Nokia, Live, Surface, Xbox, Bing and more - into a cohesive experience that will command and cement customer loyalty.\n", "\"", "That's a tall order and one that should weigh strongly on the board's choice of a new CEO,\" he said.\n", "Richard Holway, chairman of analyst TechMarketView, said given that Microsoft paid $8.5bn for Skype in 2011, the price it is paying for Nokia \"seems extremely reasonable\".\n", "However, he added: \"Our only 'surprise' now is the timing of the announcement.

To be a winner in the business market it also has to be a winner in the consumer market, something that wasn't the case a decade ago.\nAs Microsoft's own presentation about the deal, announced on Monday, notes: \"With the consumerisation of IT user matter at both home and work... We cannot risk having Apple or Google foreclose app innovation, integration, distribution or economics.\"\nNokia lashed itself to Microsoft's mast after losing out to iOS and Android in the smartphone market share stakes and with the limited success of the Lumia range so far enough to keep interest in Windows Phone alive, most analysts are seeing a certain amount of inevitability to the acquisition, even if they are split on what its biggest implications are.\nForrester mobile analyst Charles Golvin said the steadily diminishing investments by other Windows Phone licensees has left Microsoft with just Nokia as its standard bearer and added Microsoft now appears \"poised to adopt a vertically integrated strategy more akin to Apple's\".\nBut he said Microsoft's challenge remains how to unite the myriad services and brands - Windows, Nokia, Live, Surface, Xbox, Bing and more - into a cohesive experience that will command and cement customer loyalty.\n\"That's a tall order and one that should weigh strongly on the board's choice of a new CEO,\" he said.\nRichard Holway, chairman of analyst TechMarketView, said given that Microsoft paid $8.5bn for Skype in 2011, the price it is paying for Nokia \"seems extremely reasonable\".\nHowever, he added: \"Our only 'surprise' now is the timing of the announcement. For such a big deal to come just days after Ballmer stood down seems mighty strange.\"\nFor Holway, there is also an opportunity for the enlarged Microsoft to step up its business mobility efforts: \"There is undoubtedly a market opportunity for the creation of a provider of mobile solutions for the enterprise. Taking Office onto various mobile platforms. Providing secure emailing in a sector once occupied by BlackBerry.\"\nBut such a move carries its own risks - Microsoft's success has been build on being hardware agnostic and persuading device manufacturers to support it. Already its move into the tablet market with Surface will have unsettled its manufacturers which have struggled to come up with convincing form factors to tackle the decline of the PC. If Nokia's rumoured tablet appears too, this will further complicate Microsoft's relations with these partners who are essential for the success of Windows 8 (as well as Office and other products).\nBut, as Holway points out, \"on balance, Microsoft needed to make a bold move into mobile. Not doing so would mean certain terminal decline. This way at least holds out some chance of survival.\"\nCarolina Milanesi, research vice president at analyst Gartner, said by buying rather than just partnering with Nokia, Microsoft gets deeper integration, the benefit of its patents and removes any risk of Nokia either going Android or being acquired by someone else.\nBut success against iOS and Android will depend on how the companies integrate.\n\"Nokia benefits from higher R&D spend as well as more marketing budget. Microsoft benefits from a good relationship with carriers, good direct channel presence in emerging markets, the potential of going after more aggressively to the business market,\" she told ZDNet.\nBut for Milanesi, business is a secondary concern, even if it is an attractive target where Microsoft, and to a less extent Nokia, have experience: \"First and foremost it needs to be about consumers. Enterprise are certainly a target especially considering the state BlackBerry is in but consumers make or break a phone vendor today.\"\nFrom Milanesi's point of view, emerging markets need to be a longer term target for Microsoft - but the battle needs to be won in the mature markets first.\nFor Forrester principal analyst Thomas Husson, Nokia adds to Microsoft's developing market strategy. It's looking increasingly likely that the US and western European smartphone market is reaching saturation, so that most growth will come from emerging markets. Here Nokia's Asha devices could play a neat role as an 'on-ramp' for consumers buying their first smartphone. Tied in with a revamped tablet strategy this could open up a new front against Android in particular.\nBut Husson cautioned: \"This is going to be a long journey. In some countries, Windows Phone 8 market share is now above five percent and close to 10 percent. It thus still offers a limited reach for developers and marketers.\n\"Nokia is indeed still massivley popular in some emerging countries but competition is very high with Far East manufacturers and low-cost Android devices. I think it will depend on Microsoft's new strategy for emerging markets beyond just mobile phones.\"\nAll of this shows the number of competing - and occasionally contradictory - demands upon Microsoft's management.\nAs the incumbent player in a fading market, Microsoft has a take into account those differing requirements as it tries to build for the future. For example, balancing Microsoft's business customers against the need to get into consumer tech, the need to build its own hardware business against the need to keep manufacturers onside, and building up a mobile business while protecting its PC heritage.\nIt's easy to look at Apple's integrated hardware and software model and the rich ecosystem that sits around it, but it's much harder to emulate.\nGlobal coverage: Nokia Interim CEO: Microsoft deal makes us stronger | Even with Nokia devices, Microsoft wants to license Windows Phone to other makers | Does its Nokia buy thwart or fuel a possible Microsoft break-up? | Microsoft shows how to flush decades of Nokia goodwill away | Microsoft gets less than $10 per Windows Phone unit | Microsoft-Nokia deal: Reaction from the Twitter trenches | Elop drops Nokia CEO role to lead devices team under Microsoft deal\nFurther reading ", "documentTitle": null, "documentUrl": null}, {"documentFile": "2.txt", "docSentCharIdxToSentIdx": [0, 114, 169, 260, 354, 380, 436, 577, 721, 892, 1032, 1243, 1380, 1490, 1620, 1771, 1881, 1992, 2326, 2427, 2540, 2594, 2665, 2703, 2943, 3047, 3149, 3248, 3406, 3441], "documentText": [" Microsoft is buying Nokia's cell phone business and licensing its patent portfolio, according to both companies.\n", "In 2003, Nokia's cell phone market share exceeded 35%.

Per the Times, the tree even has a few Facebook accounts and a Twitter handle in its name, with one tweet proclaiming: \"I have more followers than branches.\" A consumer rights group that calls the tree a \"shameful spectacle for citizens and tourists\" is lobbying to have the tree taken down and has asked a local court to scrutinize the tree's costs.
