Morocco \u2013 In Morocco , the period between the 1960s and 1990s is often referred to as the \"years of lead,\" referring to the massive human rights violations that occurred in the government's campaign of political oppression, including executions, torture, and the annihilation of other civil liberties. Shortly after he ascended the throne in 1999, King Mohammed VI created the Independent Arbitration Commission (IAC) to compensate the victims of forced disappearances and arbitrary detention. The IAC decided more than 5,000 cases and awarded a total of US$100 million, but victims and their families complained of lack of transparency in the tribunal's procedures and demanded truth seeking measures in addition to financial compensation. These pressures were instrumental in leading to the 2004 creation of the Arab world's first official truth-seeking initiative, the Equity and Reconciliation Commission. The IER issued a reparations policy that upheld notions of gender equity and resulted in roughly US$85 million in financial compensation paid to almost 10,000 individuals, as well as recommendations on other measures such as the provision of health care and restoration of civil rights. The IER's recommendations also led to a collective reparations program that combined symbolic recognition of human rights violations with a development component in eleven regions that had suffered from collective punishment. [19] As of May 2010, implementation of the collective reparations program was ongoing. Other reparations programs have been proposed and/or implemented in: Argentina, Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, East Timor, El Salvador, Germany, Ghana, Guatemala, Haiti, Iraq, Malawi, Liberia, South Africa, Kenya, the United States, and others. [2] [20] A dignity taking is the destruction or confiscation of property rights from owners or occupiers, where the intentional or unintentional outcome is dehumanization or infantilization. [21] There are two requirements: (1) involuntary property destruction or confiscation and (2) dehumanization or infantilization. [22] Dehumanization is \u201cthe failure to recognize an individual or group\u2019s humanity\u201d and infantilization is \u201cthe restriction of an individual or group\u2019s autonomy based on the failure to recognize and respect their full capacity to reason.\u201d [21] Evidence of a dignity taking can be established empirically through either a top-down approach, examining the motive and intent behind those who initiated the taking, or a bottom-up approach, examining the viewpoints of dispossessed people. [22] When this larger harm called a dignity taking occurs, mere reparations (or compensation for physical things taken) are not enough. [21] Dignity restoration is required. [22] Dignity restoration is a remedy that seeks to provide dispossessed individuals and communities with material compensation through processes that affirm their humanity and reinforce their agency. [21] In practical terms, the remedial process places dispossessed individuals or communities in the driver\u2019s seat and gives them a significant degree of autonomy in deciding how they are made whole. [22] The dignity takings/dignity restoration framework was first created by Professor Bernadette Atuahene following her empirical exploration of land dispossession and restitution in South Africa in her book, We Want What\u2019s Ours: Learning from South Africa\u2019s Restitution Program (Oxford University Press 2014). [23] Since then, many scholars across disciplines have applied these socio-legal concepts to an array of case studies in various time periods and geographic locations, providing a transnational, historicized approach to understanding involuntary property loss and its material and non-material consequences. [24] The dignity takings/dignity restoration framework provides a lexicon to describe and analyze property takings from poor and vulnerable populations across the globe in different historical periods; focuses on redress by linking events of property dispossession to highlight opportunities for learning, resistance, and solidarity; allows people who are not property scholars to participate in the conversation about involuntary property loss and adequate remedies; captures both the material and immaterial consequences of property confiscation; and inserts dignity into the scholarly discourse about property, countering the singular focus on efficiency, which has dominated legal analysis since the ascendancy of law and economics. [25] There are logistical problems inherent in reparations, such as clearly defining the objectives, goals, and processes by which reparations will be distributed, determining how to address a range of atrocities with streamlined programs, or balancing economic development with financing reparation efforts. [26] Some experts suggest that the problems lie in the very definition of reparations themselves. [27] The right to seek and obtain reparations is vested with the state whose citizens suffered the losses, but individuals are barred from pursuing a claim for compensation directly against the state that wronged them. The grant of reparations is thus a political question, and individuals who suffered harm may be left undercompensated or uncompensated. [28] The UN's guidelines on reparations could be contested on the fact that they equate human rights violations with violations of civil and political rights, ignoring abuses of economic, social, and cultural rights. The guidelines explicitly state that their intent is to restore victims to their status in a time of peace, but the distribution of rights and resources often wasn't equal in peacetime. Thus reparations, if their intent is to return a society to its status quo , run the risk of ignoring systemic oppression and reproducing social hierarchies. [2] For instance, reparations programs have been critiqued for ignoring the needs of women in transitional justice processes. In 2007, women's groups mobilized to examine how reparations policies could be more responsive to victims of gender-based violence. Their efforts led to the \"Nairobi Declaration on Women's and Girl's Right to a Remedy and Reparation,\" which states that \"reparations must go above and beyond the immediate reasons and consequences of the crimes and violations; they must aim to address the political and structural inequalities that negatively shape women's and girl's lives.\" [29] Some of these concerns can be addressed by empowering women to have a voice in the reparations process, challenging discriminatory practices, and educating communities about sexual violence. [16] In addition to gender-based discrimination, children are often excluded from reparations procedures. The reasons of this are varied; reparations often fall in the hands of parents and are only indirectly given to children, and reparations programs often do not take into account the fact that children and adults are affected differently by violence. Thus reparations should also have a child-specific component to target abuses that are specifically suffered by children.

While some advocates for restorative justice argue that punitive tactics like reparations have no place in this method, reparations can serve as a bridge to healing the damage to the community and victims.

Restorative justice can aim to change these norms of conduct for an offender. Through proper treatment programs and personal management strategies, as well as a supportive community instituting these norms, an offender\u2019s moral mindset may be influenced. This idea draws upon Sutherland\u2019s theory of differential association, which posits that our interaction with others teaches us values, attitudes, and motives.

An offender is approached first to ensure that he/she will cooperate in apologizing and expressing remorse before asking anything of the victim (Sherman & Strang, 2007).\nAnother argument in favor of restorative justice is that it produces results; in other words, it stops certain offenders from committing crimes again. Punitive measures may or may not have a deterrent effect. For instance, there is no difference in deterrence for crimes that bring about the death penalty versus life in prison (Banks, 2013). Some criminologists argue that the criminal justice system has a deterrent effect; others state that \u201cthe criminal may well fear the law but still break it\u201d and professional criminals do not experience the same shock at getting caught (Banks, 2013, p. 119). To truly prevent future crimes, then, we must employ more than fear. Banks points out a perspective that law-abiding citizens act within the law not out of fear but because of \u201cmoral inhibitions and norms of conduct\u201d (p. 119). Restorative justice can aim to change these norms of conduct for an offender. Through proper treatment programs and personal management strategies, as well as a supportive community instituting these norms, an offender\u2019s moral mindset may be influenced. This idea draws upon Sutherland\u2019s theory of differential association, which posits that our interaction with others teaches us values, attitudes, and motives. Furthermore, analysis on restorative justice found that it \u201csubstantially reduced repeat offending for some offenders,\u201d reduced post traumatic stress for victims, \u201creduced crime victims\u2019 desire for violent revenge against their offenders,\u201d reduced recidivism, and lowered criminal justice costs (Sherman & Strang, 2007).\nRestorative justice is not flawless. It is a difficult task to engage victim and community, especially if the majority believe in a traditionally punitive approach. The process requires everyone to buy into the belief that interacting with offenders will improve the entire situation; otherwise, cooperation from all three entities will be nearly impossible to achieve.\nFurthermore, this process does not require families of offenders to participate, though this support system can be critical for an offender to amend behaviors. Incorporating the family could bring about a much larger success rate.

How do we define punishment? What are the end goals and purpose? What values should it promote? These questions reach a broad scope of opinion, depending on who is asked. Regardless, restorative justice fits into the theoretical framework of punishment. \u200bPunishment should first and foremost serve the function of protecting society. This can be done by incapacitating those who cannot be rehabilitated, and restoring those who can into productive, beneficial citizens. Restorative justice is built on the belief that a supportive community can transform negative behaviors. Restorative justice aims to heal victims, offenders, and the community. For victims, this may involve restoring property, healing injuries, and bringing back \u201ca sense of security\u201d (Banks, 2013, p. 128). Victims are involved in the justice process and given a voice; they are encouraged to tell their story and have the offender and/or community respond with empathy. On the other end, offenders are supported and controlled by social management, rather than a punitive, detached system. This means they are given the tools and resources to restore their bonds with the community and make better choices. To accomplish this, the community must stretch beyond stigmatizing criminality and adopt a supportive mentality for the victim and offender. True restorative justice occurs with all three entities: victim, offender, and community. While restorative justice is not a \u201cpunishment\u201d in the traditional sense, the way incapacitation or the death sentence is, it falls under this category because, based on Banks\u2019 descriptions, it 1) involves the community showing disapproval (in that an offender must accept responsibility); 2) allows offenders to make amends for the harm they have caused; and 3) will stop offenders from committing crimes again (2013). Where does restorative justice fit into the justice system? First, one must acknowledge the role of incapacitation and retribution. Some sociopathic tendencies cannot be treated or amended, the crimes so heinous that there are no solutions but incapacitation and retribution. These forms of punishment are important because there is no other leverage in the criminal justice system for protecting against individuals who sincerely do not care about society, law and order, rehabilitation, or the value of life itself. They feel no remorse, so the punishment should treat them with the same indifference. In other words, retribution is a \u201cfight fire with fire\u201d technique; it is concerned with justice and justice alone. Such is the case with someone like the notorious Ted Bundy, who murdered an estimated forty victims, believed killing was a divine experience, and never admitted remorse. He received the death penalty for his crimes, which, given the number of lives he mercilessly took, was the only fitting punishment that didn't violate the constitution... In the average case, however, the trouble with judging whether someone is capable of rehabilitation or restoration is that remorse is not always easy to discern, especially not in a court setting. There are conflicting ideas of what constitutes an indicator of \u201cgenuine\u201d remorse, which makes such a judgment call so subjective (Zong, 2014). Aside from the extremes, which do not currently make up the majority of our prison population, punishment should be reparative, designed to amend wrongs and prevent further harms to society. These concepts flourish with restorative justice. There are also aspects of retribution in restorative justice (Banks, 2013). An offender may be ordered to pay reparations to a victim or victim\u2019s family or complete community service. While some advocates for restorative justice argue that punitive tactics like reparations have no place in this method, reparations can serve as a bridge to healing the damage to the community and victims. It might go toward repairing a broken window, replacing a stolen item, helping to rebuild a burnt house, assist with a victim\u2019s medical bills, and so on. This goes toward allowing offenders to make amends. Opponents to restorative justice argue that victims might feel the crimes they suffered are taken less seriously than those that result in a prison sentence, and it may suggest that \u201csociety has a different attitude toward certain kinds of behavior\u201d (Banks, 2013, p. 129).

This type of freedom is explained by the small size of the republics of the time. The rivalry between the cities causes the states to buy their security at the price of war.\nFreedom in modern societies is incompatible with that of the ancients. This is the opportunity to do what we want, it is a protection of the private sphere. \"The aim of the moderns is the enjoyment of security in private pleasures; and they call liberty the guarantees accorded by institutions to these pleasures\". Size and trade explain it. The sharing of power diminishes with increasing size of states. The war has given way to trade. They are only two means to achieve the same goal, namely to possess what you want. Trade is \"an attempt to obtain by mutual agreement what one no longer hopes to conquer by violence.\" [1] War, just like trade, makes it possible to achieve a goal, and the evolution of society has changed the means without touching the end. \"Trade inspires men with a keen love of individual independence.\" Thus Athens, which was the most commercial democracy, was also the one which bestowed the most individual liberty. However, we must moderate this idea with the practice of ostracism, symbol of the power of the state over the individual.\nThe errors of the French Revolution were the result of an attempt to apply ancient liberty in a modern world. Constant criticizes Father Gabriel Bonnot de Mably , who, he says, regrets that the law only reaches actions and not thought. He explains the admiration of the author for Sparta. He also criticizes the beliefs of Jean-Jacques Rousseau .\nHe draws from his reflection a number of political principles:\n- Individual independence is the first of modern needs.\n- One must never sacrifice individual liberty to obtain political freedom.\n- The institutions of the ancient republics, hindering individual liberty, are not admissible in modern societies.\n- Individuals have rights that society must respect.\n- We must not want to go back. \"Since we are in modern times, I want freedom that is proper in modern times.\"\n- Political freedom is the guarantee; political freedom is therefore indispensable.\nThe political system must be that of representation. Every person votes for their interests to be defended. They does not speak of the general will.\nSince ancient liberty is not the same as modern liberty, it follows that they are respectively threatened with different dangers. The danger of ancient liberty rests on an alienation of the individual, in which the state crushes the individual. But the danger that threatens modern freedom is, as Tocqueville suggests, that the individual is too absorbed in the pursuit of their individual interests and renounces their rights to share political power (thus endangering their individual freedom, since is the political power that ensures its safeguarding and protection).\nHe concludes his speech by explaining the need to learn to combine these two types of freedom.

The errors of the French Revolution were the result of an attempt to apply ancient liberty in a modern world. Constant criticizes Father Gabriel Bonnot de Mably , who, he says, regrets that the law only reaches actions and not thought. He explains the admiration of the author for Sparta. He also criticizes the beliefs of Jean-Jacques Rousseau . He draws from his reflection a number of political principles: Individual independence is the first of modern needs. One must never sacrifice individual liberty to obtain political freedom. The institutions of the ancient republics, hindering individual liberty, are not admissible in modern societies. Individuals have rights that society must respect. We must not want to go back. \"Since we are in modern times, I want freedom that is proper in modern times.\" Political freedom is the guarantee; political freedom is therefore indispensable. The political system must be that of representation. Every person votes for their interests to be defended. They does not speak of the general will. Since ancient liberty is not the same as modern liberty, it follows that they are respectively threatened with different dangers. The danger of ancient liberty rests on an alienation of the individual, in which the state crushes the individual. But the danger that threatens modern freedom is, as Tocqueville suggests, that the individual is too absorbed in the pursuit of their individual interests and renounces their rights to share political power (thus endangering their individual freedom, since is the political power that ensures its safeguarding and protection). He concludes his speech by explaining the need to learn to combine these two types of freedom.

But once the deliberations were over and a vote was taken, the individual was a \u201cslave\u201d to the majority decisions of his fellow citizens. Explained Constant: The aim of the ancients was the sharing of [political] power among the citizens of the fatherland: this is what they called liberty. [But] the citizen, almost always sovereign in public affairs, was a slave in all his private relations. As a citizen, he decided peace and war, as a private individual, he was constrained, watched and repressed in all his movements; as a member of the collective body, he interrogated, dismissed, condemned, beggared, exiled, or sentenced to death his magistrates and superiors; as a subject of the collective body he could be deprived of his status, stripped of his privileges, banished, put to death, by the discretionary will of the whole to which he belonged ... The ancients, as Condorcet says, had no notion of individual rights. Men were, so to speak, merely machines, whose gears and cog-wheels were regulated by the law ... The individual was in some way lost in the nation, the citizen in the city. Benjamin Constant compared this \u201cliberty of the ancients\u201d with that of the \u201cmoderns\u201d \u2013 that is, the conception and ideal of liberty popular in his own time in the early decades of the nineteenth century. Now, he said, the idea of freedom was the right of the individual to be left alone. The individual was at liberty to guide his own life, choose his own goals, and pursue any ambitions and career that he might want. He could form any interpersonal associations he chose, or could follow his own way by himself. Political liberty was an important part of freedom, Benjamin Constant argued. But the essence of liberty for the \u201cmoderns\u201d was the right of the individual to live his own life as he desired, with no interference or \u201cdictate\u201d by political minorities or majorities. Constant explained: ... what an Englishman, a Frenchman, and a citizen of the United States of America understand today by the word 'liberty.' For each of them it is the right to be subjected to the laws, and to be neither arrested, detained, put to death or maltreated in any way by the arbitrary will of one or more individuals. It is the right of everyone to express their opinion, choose a profession and practice it, to dispose of property, and even to abuse it; to come and go without permission, and without having to account for their motives or undertakings. It is everyone's right to associate with other individuals, either to discuss their interests, or to profess the religion which they and their associates prefer, or even simply to occupy their days or hours in a way which is most compatible with their inclinations and whims. Slavery Demeaned Honest Labor and Weakened Incentives It is also important to remember that Greek society and the ancient Greek economy was based on slave labor. This resulted in two outcomes: First, anything involving manual labor, and the common working for a living, as well as the day-to-day dealing in money and the exchanging of goods and services, was considered beneath a cultured and free citizen of a Greek city-state. It distracted the Greek citizen from his first and highest duty: participation and interest in the political, philosophical, and artistic affairs of his city-state. This did not make for an intellectual climate conducive to making questions of economic relationships and institutions a respectable field for serious reflection and thought. Second, the use of slave labor diminished any motives or incentives on the part of the thinking, free citizen to concern himself with questions of how to economize and more efficiently use labor. Since, once captured and sold into slavery, a slave could not refuse to work or demand higher wages or better work conditions, or search out better employment opportunities, there was little motive for developing ways to more effectively employ labor through better social or market arrangements. Nestled at the end of a residential cul-de-sac in Hopewell, Virginia is Dream Tech Academy , a microschool founded by former public school teacher, Danette Buckley. Originally from Jamaica, Buckley moved to the U.S. as an adolescent and gravitated toward a career in education, with a passion for entrepreneurship. \u201cThis has been a dream for so long,\u201d Buckley told me when I visited her microschool, located in an inviting single family home just outside of Richmond that she purchased exclusively for her school. Dream Tech Academy launched in 2019 with four children, including three of her own, as a homeschooling and tutoring program. It is now a recognized K-12 private school with about 30 children and four hired educators. The intentionally small size and individualized educational approach that characterize most modern microschools are what Buckley finds so appealing about this model, and what more parents seem to be seeking. \u201cParents want the small, home-like, personalized environment,\u201d said Buckley, noting that such personalization was often challenging within the conventional system. \u201cComing from public schools, I often felt that if only I could have a student for a couple more months, or if I could just offer them a little more or slightly different from what they were getting, they would excel.\u201d At Dream Tech Academy, Buckley is able to adapt her curriculum and teaching according to each child\u2019s particular needs. She is seeing some astonishing results. One child who entered Dream Tech this year as a third grader had been receiving Bs and Cs on his report card at a local district school, but his mother felt like something was off. Sure enough, when Buckley assessed the student upon enrollment, she discovered that he couldn\u2019t read at all. Buckley got to work creating a customized curriculum for the child, and the mixed-age, mastery-based microschool model meant that the boy didn\u2019t feel noticeably behind his peers or otherwise alienated. \u201cWe don\u2019t emphasize grade levels here. It\u2019s all based on ability,\u201d said Buckley. \u201cWithin three weeks we saw so much improvement in him,\u201d she added. Annual tuition at Dream Tech Academy is approximately $4,600 which, like most microschools, is less expensive than traditional private schools but still financially out of reach for many families. \u201cOur community is low-income, with most students in the district on free or reduced lunches,\u201d said Buckley. More than 90 percent of the students in the Hopewell district schools are classified as being economically disadvantaged, and 80 percent of district students are minorities. In 2020, Buckley received a microgrant from the VELA Education Fund, a national philanthropic non-profit that offers funding and support for everyday entrepreneurs who are creating non-traditional education options in their communities. Since 2019, VELA has issued more than 2,000 grants totaling over $24 million to entrepreneurial parents and teachers throughout the U.S. Like many VELA grantees, Buckley put her grant award toward student scholarships, particularly for families who discovered Dream Tech during school closures and remote learning and wanted to stay. \u201cI was so thankful because I had a good amount of parents who wanted to come back and couldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d said Buckley. In serving a racially diverse, largely low-income population of students, Buckley\u2019s microschool is more the norm than the exception. The VELA Education Fund recently released a report, Open for Business , that provides greater detail about its grant recipients. The organization collected survey data in fall 2022 from more than 400 of the education entrepreneurs who received VELA funding. The results indicate that 93 percent of the students and families attending these non-traditional learning environments are low-income or from historically underserved populations, and nearly 40 percent of the entrepreneurs leading these programs are intentionally serving these populations as part of their organizational mission. \u201cOur research affirmed something we at VELA already knew: that unconventional education is for everyone \u2014 not just for white, affluent families,\u201d said Michael Crawford, VELA\u2019s Director of Community Research and lead author of the new report. \u201cWhat we continue to see is that a diverse range of entrepreneurs are creatively responding to the needs of learners and families in their communities by devising bespoke, flexible, and resilient business models to launch and sustain their programs.\u201d Last week, Mike McShane of EdChoice released findings of his related study with a smaller cohort of education entrepreneurs in which he discovered similar results, while last month, the National Microschooling Center (NMC) issued a report revealing that the top motivator for prospective microschool founders is the opportunity to serve \u201csystemically underserved or marginalized communities.\u201d The second primary motivator for prospective education entrepreneurs, according to the NMC survey, is the opportunity to \u201cenable children to thrive as they had not in prior settings.\u201d At Dream Tech Academy, Buckley observes children thriving every day. She told me about two autistic siblings from a military family who moved from the Pacific Northwest last summer and joined her microschool. \u201cThey enrolled before they even got here,\u201d said Buckley. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even see the place, but the parents were so excited because their kids have never been in a general education classroom. They\u2019ve always been in a \u2018contained\u2019 classroom for special needs students.\u201d Buckley explained that the students should have been in the 5th and 6th grades, respectively, by age, but academically they were performing several grade levels behind. Since arriving at the microschool, they have already jumped more than two grade levels. \u201cThe whole point is to have a personalized learning experience,\u201d said Buckley, adding that personalization isn\u2019t just for students who are lagging academically. \u201cWe have many students here who are doing advanced work, well above their grade level. It\u2019s about giving everyone a chance to excel and asking, how can we help you be at your best?\u201d While the education disruption beginning in 2020 catalyzed interest in alternative learning models such as microschooling and homeschooling, the momentum is hardly waning. In the Richmond area alone, microschooling is growing rapidly. Alycia Wright , another former public school teacher and VELA grant recipient who runs Cultural Roots Homeschool Cooperative , has more than 125 students in her Richmond program, as well as a waitlist of families who are interested in her model. Cultural Roots has already outgrown the community center space where the group meets several times a week, and is now looking at office buildings or unused schools to accommodate continued growth, including expanding its high school microschool program. New microschools are also at capacity. Two weeks ago, former public school teacher, Mercedes Grant , opened fall registration for her new microschool, Path of Life Learning , located near Richmond. With 22 students now enrolled, she is about to move to a waitlist. Many microschool founders report immense job satisfaction. For those who were former conventional school teachers, microschooling and related non-traditional learning models enable them to work with young people in a more individualized, authentic way that can be difficult within the standardized system. \u200b\u200bFor Buckley, leading Dream Tech Academy is a joy. \u201cI absolutely love education. I don\u2019t even feel like I\u2019m working,\u201d she said.", "documentFile": "https://fee.org/articles/did-the-ancient-greeks-believe-in-freedom/"}, {"source_title": "History of Natural Law & Basic Freedoms, Cyrus the Great: United for Human Rights", "source_content_title": "A Brief History of Human Rights", "source_date": null, "source_author": null, "documentText": ["The Cyrus Cylinder (539 B.C.)\nIn 539 B.C., the armies of Cyrus the Great, the first king of ancient Persia, conquered the city of Babylon.", "But it was his next actions that marked a major advance for Man.", "He freed the slaves, declared that all people had the right to choose their own religion, and established racial equality.", "These and other decrees were recorded on a baked-clay cylinder in the Akkadian language with cuneiform script.", "\nKnown today as the Cyrus Cylinder, this ancient record has now been recognized as the world\u2019s first charter of human rights.", "It is translated into all six official languages of the United Nations and its provisions parallel the first four Articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.", "\nThe Spread of Human Rights\nFrom Babylon, the idea of human rights spread quickly to India, Greece and eventually Rome.", "There the concept of \u201cnatural law\u201d arose, in observation of the fact that people tended to follow certain unwritten laws in the course of life, and Roman law was based on rational ideas derived from the nature of things.", "\nDocuments asserting individual rights, such as the Magna Carta (1215), the Petition of Right (1628), the US Constitution (1787), the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (1789), and the US Bill of Rights (1791) are the written precursors to many of today\u2019s human rights documents.", "\nSIGN THE PETITION"], "rawDocumentText": "The Cyrus Cylinder (539 B.C.)\nIn 539 B.C., the armies of Cyrus the Great, the first king of ancient Persia, conquered the city of Babylon.

While you can\u2019t die from weed, consuming too much can ruin your evening. If you have too much weed in your system, here are some ways to sober up if you\u2019re too high . If you\u2019ve been smoking too much in general, you can always take a tolerance break . Absolutely. Because the plant is still federally illegal, many employers can test for weed and you can lose your job if you test positive. However, as legalization increases across the country, some employers are not testing for weed\u2014for example, online retail giant Amazon has said they won\u2019t . Learn how to detox from weed . Conventional wisdom says that THC will stay in your system for 30 days , but it really depends. Frequency of use is a big factor: THC will likely clear your system more quickly if you only smoke every once in a while, versus smoking every day for months on end. Additionally, different types of tests have different detection windows: a urine test can usually detect THC up to 30 days; blood, a day or two; hair, up to 90 days. THC, or delta-9, is the main compound in weed that gets you high. Delta-8 and delta-10 are separate cannabinoids that will also get you high, albeit less so. Chemically, all the deltas have a chain of carbon atoms with a double bond in their structure. The placement of the double bond defines each cannabinoid\u2014delta-9 has it on the ninth carbon, delta-8 on the eighth, etc. The placement of that double bond is thought to make delta-9 THC more potent than the other two. Delta-9 THC is much stronger than both delta-8 and delta-10. Both delta-8 and delta-10 are thought of as \u201cdiet weeds\u201d because of their lesser effects. Anecdotally, some claim that delta-8 is more sedating, and delta-10 is more energizing. Delta-8 will typically stay in your body for the same amount of time as delta-9 THC. If you smoke or vape either, they will last about an hour or so; if you take some edibles, they will last a few hours. THC is illegal at the federal level and is only legal in specific US states that have enacted laws to allow it, either for recreational or medical use. It is also legal in all of Canada and Uruguay. Check out Leafly\u2019s Legalization guide for specific cannabis laws in each state, including possession, consumption, purchasing, growing, and more. As of Oct. 2022, weed is legal in 19 US states for adult use and 39 states for medical use. THC products can be purchased in adult-use states by anyone over the age of 21 with a valid ID. Requirements vary slightly in medical states, but typically, patients must be over 18 years of age, have a medical marijuana card, and a prescription from a doctor in order to buy cannabis. Hemp-derived delta-9 exists in a legal gray area. It is technically legal in all US states because it is sourced from hemp, but laws can change quickly. For example, delta-8 is specifically outlawed in some states, and hemp delta-9 may have a similar fate. Generally speaking, most states with adult-use cannabis allow the possession of up to one ounce, or 28 grams, of cannabis flower on your person. Some states have different possession limits for other products, such as edibles and concentrates. For example, in Oregon, adults can possess one ounce of flower, one ounce of concentrates, and 16 ounces of edibles, but other states may vary. Medical allowances are usually higher than recreational ones. No. It is illegal to ship any cannabis product, that is, any product containing more than 0.3% THC. As cannabis is federally legal, it cannot be shipped through the USPS , which is run by the federal government. It is also a federal offense to move cannabis products across state lines, as it violates federal contraband law, even between two states that both have legal cannabis. Hemp-derived delta-9, delta-8, or delta-10 products can be shipped to some states as they are sourced from hemp, plants with less than 0.3% THC, and not cannabis plants. However, some states have specifically outlawed these hemp substances. Be sure to check if it is legal to mail a certain hemp product in your state.", "documentFile": "https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/what-is-delta-9-thc"}], "set_of_highlights_in_context": [{"source_supports_statement": "complete_support", "docSentText": "\nTHC is the cannabinoid responsible for making people experience an intoxicating effect when they consume cannabis.", "docSpanText": "THC is the cannabinoid responsible for making people experience an intoxicating effect when they consume cannabis.", "docSentCharIdx": 909.0, "problematic_instance": "no", "is_split": "no", "docSpanOffsets": [[910, 1024]], "sent_idx": 12.0, "scuSentence": "Delta-9 THC is the main cannabinoid responsible for making people experience an intoxicating effect when they consume cannabis.", "scuSentCharIdx": 0, "documentFile": "https://www.healthline.com/health/what-is-delta-9", "statement_supported": "Yes", "prefix": ""}, {"source_supports_statement": "complete_support", "docSentText": "A common negative effect some report is feeling paranoia or anxiety after consuming weed\u2014this can be especially true with edibles, which can be hard to dose (our motto is: \u201cstart low, go slow\u201d).", "docSpanText": "common negative effect some report is feeling paranoia or anxiety after consuming weed\u2014this can be especially true with edibles, which can be hard to dose (our motto is: \u201cstart low, go slow\u201d).", "docSentCharIdx": 2903.0, "problematic_instance": "no", "is_split": "yes", "docSpanOffsets": [[2905, 3097]], "sent_idx": 27.0, "scuSentence": "It is much stronger than delta-8 and delta-10 and can cause negative effects such as paranoia or anxiety.", "scuSentCharIdx": 128, "documentFile": "https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/what-is-delta-9-thc", "statement_supported": "Yes", "prefix": "Delta-9 THC is the main cannabinoid responsible for making people experience an intoxicating effect when they consume cannabis.

Tom (published on 10/22/2007) A: Sure, but many oils evaporate very slowly at ordinary temperatures. mike W, Lee H mike W, Lee H (published on 10/22/2007) Q: Does the thickness of the layer of vegetable oil on top of water affect the evaporation rate of the water and does it vary with the thickness of the oil? - William (age 12) KS - William (age 12) KS A: Yes, the thicker the oil layer the slower the water diffusion through it to the surface, so the slower the evaporation. The type of oil will also matter, because the solubility of water in different oils is different, so different concentrations of water will be moving through different types of oil. Also, the diffusion rate will be different in different oils, and \u2019thicker\u2019 ones (more viscous) will tend to have slower water diffusion. However, I suspect that the water solubility will vary more between different oils than will the water diffusion rate. Mike W. Mike W.

Instead of requiring a simple symbol or text disclosure, as Vermont did, the USDA rule lets companies use opaque workarounds like QR codes and call-in phone numbers to disclose their use of genetic engineering. Equally worrisome is the rule\u2019s definition of bioengineered (BE) products \u2014 its proxy term for GMO. It is so lax that it allows thousands of products to avoid mandatory labeling even though they are genetically engineered by any popular definition of the term. Here\u2019s an example: If the predominant ingredient in a product is egg, meat, or poultry, that product is excluded from the GMO labeling requirement even if all the remaining ingredients are genetically engineered. The new rule doesn\u2019t help anybody. It does little to clear up the confusion that already exists and creates a mixed standard in which some GMO-based products are labeled and some are not. This is even more confusing than not labeling at all. Consumers deserve clear, consistent labeling that tells them what they want to know when shopping for food: Is a product made with genetically modified organisms or not, according to their understanding of that term rather than a statutory definition riddled with exceptions. The label should be immediately understood and uniform, like a universal icon or a piece of easily understood text. The USDA\u2019s rule did not accomplish that. But with so much at stake, we can\u2019t afford to wait until it generates the next rule. That\u2019s why ZBiotics is now labeling its products as \u201cGMO\u201d and \u201cgenetically engineered,\u201d using easily understood text. In addition, we chose to use the clearest version of the USDA\u2019s new label options: the circular \u201cBioengineered\u201d icon. It\u2019s not just that transparency is the right thing to do for consumers. If done right, companies should be proud of the fact that they use genetic engineering. The impact of one small company\u2019s choice to label all of its products as genetically engineered is limited. That\u2019s why we are inviting others to help us develop a clear labeling vocabulary made for a new wave of genetic engineering companies: those who care about their customers, who value transparency over obscurity, and who want the best for this technology and for the planet.

People of good faith can insert these virtues and sensibilities into politics and society. Charity, for example, is one of the pillars of Islam, as it is in Christianity. And I know how much is done by, say, Christian Aid or Islamic Relief worldwide. However, I fear and loathe the politicization of religion and religious collaborators with political power. Church leaders blessing Donald Trump and cursing his opponents as godless dramatically play out the dangers of these unholy alliances. The worst example is Myanmar, where a large number of Buddhist monks \u2013 those gentle, self-denying men in saffron \u2013 have backed and participated in horrific, state-sponsored persecutions of the Rohingya Muslims. Meanwhile women and girls, even rape victims, are imprisoned in some South American states if they have abortions. The most sinister and oppressive states in the world are those that use God to control the minds and actions of their populations \u2013 Yasmin And here in England and Wales, more faith-based schools are being funded. These schools may be producing good exam results, but they are socially conservative and focused on their own religious exceptionalism. Incongruently, in Northern Ireland, integrated schools are being encouraged because the people there know what happens when religious and political apartheid continue from generation to generation. I am so glad we had this exchange. It has helped me understand why faith means so much to many of us and pushed me towards an uncompromising position: states and faiths must be kept apart. DAWN: But equally, in the US, many religious leaders have spoken out against Trump \u2013 a number of nuns and Jesuit priests were arrested for demonstrating against his immigration policies recently after refusing to leave a sit-in. Religious leaders have been deeply involved in anti-racist and anti-fascist struggles, and [are] often killed themselves when speaking out against repressive regimes. The demand for faith-based schools isn\u2019t just down to exam results, but people wanting to connect with their own culture: my Catholic school taught us a lot about the history of oppression, struggle and the fight for civil rights \u2013 not all schools are chosen by parents for social conservatism. In Northern Ireland, especially around housing, the state\u2019s blindness to religious background and rush to build integrated communities without considering safety and cultural history has led to attacks on homes and households being forced to flee for their personal safety after police warnings. The state has a duty to consider how important religion is to so many people, rather than blindly seeking to impose secularism on a community without considering the consequences and complications.

Andersen\nOf the Seventy\nReligion and government travel different but parallel tracks. They are most successful and most effective when they protect and encourage one another.\nReligion and government are like a couple who sometimes have a hard time living together but who find they simply cannot live apart. Religion and government both need their independence in order to flourish, but history has shown that a complete divorce is healthy for neither. They travel different but parallel tracks. They are most successful and most effective when they protect and encourage one another.\nGovernments play an essential role in protecting and maintaining religious freedom and in fostering the role of churches in society. Fortunately, most governments in the world today recognize at least some degree of religious freedom and ensure to their citizens the right to worship and to practice their religion according to the dictates of their own conscience. That has not always been the case.\nMany generations have seen the stifling loss of freedom that results when government imposes a state religion. Others have experienced the moral collapse that accompanies governmental prohibition of religion altogether. We are thankful that a growing majority of the constitutions of countries in today\u2019s world envision a society where religious belief and observance, though separate from government, should be protected and safeguarded against persecution. 1\nThe heaven-inspired government described in the Book of Mormon afforded this freedom of religious belief and practice to its people:\n\u201cNow if a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him. \u2026\n\u201cFor there was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man\u2019s belief\u201d ( Alma 30:9, 11 ).\nAs people of faith we should be thankful for governmental protections that allow us to embrace and practice our religious beliefs as we desire.\nIt is perhaps less obvious to some that religion and morality play an essential role in maintaining and promoting good and effective government. The only real solutions to many of the serious problems facing our world today are spiritual, not political or economic. Racism, violence, and hate crimes, for example, are spiritual problems, and their only real solution is spiritual. Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles has taught:\n\u201cMany of the most significant moral advances in Western society have been motivated by religious principles and persuaded to official adoption by pulpit preaching. Examples include the abolition of the slave trade in England and the Emancipation Proclamation in [the United States]. The same is true of the Civil Rights movement of the last half-century.\u201d 2\nSocieties depend in large part upon religion and churches to establish moral order. Government can never build enough jails to house the criminals produced by a society lacking in morality, character, and faith. These attributes are better encouraged by religious observance than by legislative decree or police force. It is impossible for government to control the attitudes, desires, and hopes that spring from the human heart. And yet these are the seeds that grow into the conduct government must regulate.\nFrench historian and statesman Alexis de Tocqueville wrote, \u201cDespotism may govern without faith, but liberty cannot.\u201d 3 And even despotism cannot govern indefinitely without faith. For as Boris Yeltsin, first president of the Russian Federation, observed, \u201cYou can build a throne with bayonets, but it\u2019s difficult to sit on it.\u201d 4\nIn the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus contrasted the law written on the books with the law written in the heart.\n\u201cYe have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:\n\u201cBut I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment\u201d ( Matthew 5:21\u201322 ).\nWhile governments enforce the law written on the books, religion teaches and encourages adherence to the law written in the heart. Those who abide the latter will seldom if ever violate the former. As we read in the Doctrine and Covenants, \u201cHe that keepeth the laws of God hath no need to break the laws of the land\u201d (58:21).\nBut where matters of the heart are ignored, the black letter law and the legal machinery of government will eventually bog down. Civility in society is achieved when the majority of people do what is moral because they believe they should, not because they are compelled by law or by police force.\nGovernment oversees the conduct of its citizens. It tries to get them to behave in a decent and moral way. Religion, on the other hand, tries to get them to desire to behave in a decent and moral way. President Ezra Taft Benson (1899\u20131994), a cabinet member under U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, taught this most important distinction:\n\u201cThe Lord works from the inside out. The world works from the outside in. The world would take people out of the slums. Christ takes the slums out of people, and then they take themselves out of the slums. The world would mold men by changing their environment. Christ changes men, who then change their environment. The world would shape human behavior, but Christ can change human nature.\u201d 5\nOver time all free governments must ultimately depend on the voluntary goodness and support of their citizens. As legendary statesman and political philosopher Edmund Burke said, \u201cIt is ordained in the eternal constitution of things, that men of intemperate minds cannot be free. Their passions forge their fetters.\u201d 6\nTo that end, good government protects religion and fosters religious freedom. And good religion encourages good citizenship and adherence to the law of the land.\nGood government need not take sides. It should not foster or favor one religion over another. Its representatives must be free to believe and practice according to the dictates of their own conscience. By the same token, good religion should neither endorse nor oppose any political party or candidate. And its believers must be free and even encouraged to participate in the political process and to support whichever party or candidate they think best.\nWhile the Church, as an institution, has repeatedly affirmed its political neutrality, Latter-day Saints are encouraged to engage in the political process and to add their voices to the public debate. It is part of our religion to be good citizens wherever we live.\nHandbook 2: Administering the Church states, \u201cIn accordance with the laws of their respective governments, members are encouraged to register to vote, to study issues and candidates carefully, and to vote for individuals who they believe will act with integrity and sound judgment. Latter-day Saints have a special obligation to seek out, vote for, and uphold leaders who are honest, good, and wise (see D&C 98:10 ).\u201d 7\nOne day the Savior will come again.

Andersen Of the Seventy Religion and government travel different but parallel tracks. They are most successful and most effective when they protect and encourage one another. Religion and government are like a couple who sometimes have a hard time living together but who find they simply cannot live apart. Religion and government both need their independence in order to flourish, but history has shown that a complete divorce is healthy for neither. They travel different but parallel tracks. They are most successful and most effective when they protect and encourage one another. Governments play an essential role in protecting and maintaining religious freedom and in fostering the role of churches in society. Fortunately, most governments in the world today recognize at least some degree of religious freedom and ensure to their citizens the right to worship and to practice their religion according to the dictates of their own conscience. That has not always been the case. Many generations have seen the stifling loss of freedom that results when government imposes a state religion. Others have experienced the moral collapse that accompanies governmental prohibition of religion altogether. We are thankful that a growing majority of the constitutions of countries in today\u2019s world envision a society where religious belief and observance, though separate from government, should be protected and safeguarded against persecution. 1 The heaven-inspired government described in the Book of Mormon afforded this freedom of religious belief and practice to its people: \u201cNow if a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him. \u2026 \u201cFor there was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man\u2019s belief\u201d ( Alma 30:9, 11 ). As people of faith we should be thankful for governmental protections that allow us to embrace and practice our religious beliefs as we desire. It is perhaps less obvious to some that religion and morality play an essential role in maintaining and promoting good and effective government. The only real solutions to many of the serious problems facing our world today are spiritual, not political or economic. Racism, violence, and hate crimes, for example, are spiritual problems, and their only real solution is spiritual. Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles has taught: \u201cMany of the most significant moral advances in Western society have been motivated by religious principles and persuaded to official adoption by pulpit preaching. Examples include the abolition of the slave trade in England and the Emancipation Proclamation in [the United States]. The same is true of the Civil Rights movement of the last half-century.\u201d 2 Societies depend in large part upon religion and churches to establish moral order. Government can never build enough jails to house the criminals produced by a society lacking in morality, character, and faith. These attributes are better encouraged by religious observance than by legislative decree or police force. It is impossible for government to control the attitudes, desires, and hopes that spring from the human heart. And yet these are the seeds that grow into the conduct government must regulate. French historian and statesman Alexis de Tocqueville wrote, \u201cDespotism may govern without faith, but liberty cannot.\u201d 3 And even despotism cannot govern indefinitely without faith. For as Boris Yeltsin, first president of the Russian Federation, observed, \u201cYou can build a throne with bayonets, but it\u2019s difficult to sit on it.\u201d 4 In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus contrasted the law written on the books with the law written in the heart. \u201cYe have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: \u201cBut I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment\u201d ( Matthew 5:21\u201322 ). While governments enforce the law written on the books, religion teaches and encourages adherence to the law written in the heart. Those who abide the latter will seldom if ever violate the former. As we read in the Doctrine and Covenants, \u201cHe that keepeth the laws of God hath no need to break the laws of the land\u201d (58:21). But where matters of the heart are ignored, the black letter law and the legal machinery of government will eventually bog down. Civility in society is achieved when the majority of people do what is moral because they believe they should, not because they are compelled by law or by police force. Government oversees the conduct of its citizens. It tries to get them to behave in a decent and moral way. Religion, on the other hand, tries to get them to desire to behave in a decent and moral way. President Ezra Taft Benson (1899\u20131994), a cabinet member under U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, taught this most important distinction: \u201cThe Lord works from the inside out. The world works from the outside in. The world would take people out of the slums. Christ takes the slums out of people, and then they take themselves out of the slums. The world would mold men by changing their environment. Christ changes men, who then change their environment. The world would shape human behavior, but Christ can change human nature.\u201d 5 Over time all free governments must ultimately depend on the voluntary goodness and support of their citizens. As legendary statesman and political philosopher Edmund Burke said, \u201cIt is ordained in the eternal constitution of things, that men of intemperate minds cannot be free. Their passions forge their fetters.\u201d 6 To that end, good government protects religion and fosters religious freedom. And good religion encourages good citizenship and adherence to the law of the land. Good government need not take sides. It should not foster or favor one religion over another. Its representatives must be free to believe and practice according to the dictates of their own conscience. By the same token, good religion should neither endorse nor oppose any political party or candidate. And its believers must be free and even encouraged to participate in the political process and to support whichever party or candidate they think best. While the Church, as an institution, has repeatedly affirmed its political neutrality, Latter-day Saints are encouraged to engage in the political process and to add their voices to the public debate. It is part of our religion to be good citizens wherever we live. Handbook 2: Administering the Church states, \u201cIn accordance with the laws of their respective governments, members are encouraged to register to vote, to study issues and candidates carefully, and to vote for individuals who they believe will act with integrity and sound judgment. Latter-day Saints have a special obligation to seek out, vote for, and uphold leaders who are honest, good, and wise (see D&C 98:10 ).\u201d 7 One day the Savior will come again. It is His right to rule and to reign as the King of kings and as our great High Priest. Then the scepter of government and the power of the priesthood will be combined into one. Until that great day, religion and government must walk down the path of human history hand in hand\u2014each respecting the other\u2019s independence, each appreciating the other\u2019s essential contribution.", "documentFile": "https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2015/07/religion-and-government?lang=eng"}, {"source_title": "Americans Have Positive Views About Religion's Role in

About seven-in-ten say the sermons at their place of worship have about the right amount of political discussion, while 14% say there is not enough political talk and 11% say there is too much political talk in the sermons they hear.\nFurthermore, congregants tend to agree with their clergy when politics is discussed: Overall, about six-in-ten say they generally agree with their clergy about politics (62%), although Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say this (70% vs. 56%).\nThe survey asked those who attend religious services at least a few times a year the extent to which religious leaders help inform their opinion about three social and political issues: abortion, immigration and global climate change.

Catholics are consistently less likely than Protestants \u2013 particularly evangelical Protestants \u2013 to say they trust their clergy on all three issues. On abortion, for example, 34% of Catholics say they have a lot of trust in their clergy to provide guidance that helps form their opinion, compared with 46% of Protestants overall and 57% of evangelical Protestants who say this. Mainline Protestants (33%) and members of the historically black Protestant tradition (32%) look similar to Catholics on this question.\nOther key findings from the survey include:\n- Americans who attend religious services with any regularity express \u201ca lot\u201d of trust in the clergy or other religious leaders at their place of worship to provide advice about religious questions, such as growing closer to God or how to interpret scripture. They are more skeptical about advice from their religious leaders on other common life milestones and issues, such as marriage and relationships, parenting, mental health problems, and personal finances, although most express at least \u201csome\u201d confidence in their clergy to weigh in on these topics.

About one-third of attenders say they\u2019ve heard their clergy mention evangelical Christians (33%) or Muslims (31%).

While some say this is a good thing, many more view it as a negative development, reflecting the broad tendency of Americans to see religion as a positive force in society. At the same time, U.S. adults are resoundingly clear in their belief that religious institutions should stay out of politics. Nearly two-thirds of Americans in the new survey say churches and other houses of worship should keep out of political matters, while 36% say they should express their views on day-to-day social and political questions. And three-quarters of the public expresses the view that churches should not come out in favor of one candidate over another during elections, in contrast with efforts by President Trump to roll back existing legal limits on houses of worship endorsing candidates. 1 In addition, Americans are more likely to say that churches and other houses of worship currently have too much influence in politics (37%) rather than too little (28%), while the remaining one-third (34%) say religious groups\u2019 current level of influence on politics is about right. On balance, U.S. adults have a favorable view about the role religious institutions play in American life more broadly \u2013 beyond politics. More than half of the public believes that churches and religious organizations do more good than harm in American society, while just one-in-five Americans say religious organizations do more harm than good. Likewise, there are far more U.S. adults who say that religious organizations strengthen morality in society and mostly bring people together than there are who say that religious organizations weaken morality and mostly push people apart. On all three of these questions, views have held steady since 2017 , the last time the Center measured opinions on these issues. The survey also shows that roughly four-in-ten U.S. adults \u2013 including a majority of Christians \u2013 lament what they perceive as religion\u2019s declining influence on American society, while fewer than two-in-ten say they think religion is losing influence in American life and that this is a good thing. In addition, roughly two-thirds of the public believes that religious leaders in general have high or very high ethical standards, and a larger share of Americans who attend religious services at least a few times a year say this about the clergy in their own congregations. Among these U.S. adults who attend religious services, majorities express at least \u201csome\u201d confidence in their clergy to provide useful guidance not only on clearly religious topics (such as how to interpret scripture) but also on other matters, such as parenting and personal finance (see Chapter 2 ). These are among the key findings from a nationally representative survey of 6,364 U.S. adults conducted online from March 18 to April 1, 2019, using Pew Research Center\u2019s American Trends Panel. The margin of sampling error for the full sample is plus or minus 1.7 percentage points. Many of the questions in the survey were asked only of U.S. adults who attend religious services a few times a year or more often; results for that group have a margin of error of plus or minus 2.4 percentage points. The survey, part of an ongoing effort by the Center to explore the role of trust, facts and democracy in American society, was designed to gauge the public\u2019s views about many aspects of religion\u2019s role in public life, as well as asking how much U.S. adults trust clergy to provide various kinds of guidance, what messages Americans receive from their clergy about other religious groups, how satisfied they are with the sermons they hear, how close they feel to their religious leaders, and whether they know \u2013 and share \u2013 the political views of the clergy in their houses of worship. The survey shows that slightly more than half of U.S. adults say that the Republican Party is friendly toward religion (54%), while just under half say the same about the Trump administration (47%). Far fewer say these two groups are unfriendly toward religion. Other major societal institutions are viewed by majorities or pluralities of the public as neutral toward religion; for instance, roughly seven-in-ten U.S. adults say the Supreme Court is neutral toward religion. Equal shares say that reporters and the news media (54%) and university professors (54%) are neutral toward religion, and 48% say this about the Democratic Party. In each of these cases, however, Americans are considerably more likely to say these groups are unfriendly toward religion than to say they are friendly. For instance, more than one-third of the public (37%) says university professors are unfriendly to religion, while just 6% say professors are friendly to religion. On balance, Republicans and Democrats mostly agree with each other that the GOP is friendly toward religion. They disagree, however, in their views about the Democratic Party; most Republicans and those who lean toward the Republican Party say the Democratic Party is unfriendly toward religion, while most Democrats and those who lean to the Democratic Party view their own party as neutral toward religion. The survey also finds that four-in-ten U.S. adults (including six-in-ten among those who identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party) think religious conservatives have too much control over the Republican Party. At the same time, one-third of Americans (including six-in-ten among those who identify with or lean toward the GOP) say liberals who are not religious have too much control over the Democratic Party. More broadly, Republicans and Democrats express very different opinions about religion\u2019s impact on American public life. Seven-in-ten Republicans say churches and religious organizations do more good than harm in the U.S., and two-thirds say these institutions strengthen morality in American society and mostly bring people together (rather than push them apart). On all three of these measures, Democrats are less likely to share these positive views of religious organizations. 2 Furthermore, most Republicans say religion either has about the right amount of influence (44%) or not enough influence (38%) in the political sphere, while a slim majority of Democrats say that religion has too much influence in politics (54%). And although most Republicans and Democrats (including those who lean toward each party) agree that religion is losing influence in American life, Republicans are far more likely than Democrats to view this as a regrettable development (63% vs. 27%). There are about as many Democrats who say religion\u2019s decline is a good thing (25%) as there are who say it is a bad thing (27%), with 22% of Democrats saying religion\u2019s declining influence doesn\u2019t make much difference either way. There are stark racial differences among Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party in views on religion\u2019s role in society: Black Democrats consistently express more positive views of religious institutions than do white Democrats. For example, half or more of black Democrats say churches and religious organizations do more good than harm in American society, mostly bring people together (rather than push them apart), and strengthen morality in society. White Democrats are substantially less inclined than black Democrats to hold these views. In addition, two-thirds of white Democrats say churches have too much political power, compared with only three-in-ten black Democrats and four-in-ten Hispanic Democrats who say this. In fact, black Democrats are just as likely as white Republicans to say churches do not have enough influence in politics (37% each). 3 And while one-third of white Democrats (33%) say that religion is losing influence in society more broadly and that this is a good thing, far fewer black (9%) and Hispanic (18%) Democrats agree. The survey also sought to gauge people\u2019s perceptions about the politics of their clergy, finding that relatively few Americans say their clergy are united on one side of the partisan divide. In fact, many Americans who attend religious services at least a few times a year say they are unsure of the party affiliation of the clergy at their place of worship (45%), while about one-in-four say their clergy are a mix of both Republicans and Democrats (27%). 4 When those who attend religious services think they know their leaders\u2019 party affiliation, slightly more say their clergy are mostly Republicans (16%) than say they are mostly Democrats (11%). Among partisans, few say their clergy are mostly members of the opposite party. For example, among those who attend religious services at least a few times a year and identify with or lean toward the Republican Party, just 4% say their clergy are mostly Democrats, while 23% say they are Republicans. Similarly, among Democrats and Democratic leaners, 8% say their clergy are Republicans, while 20% say their clergy are Democrats. Among both groups, most say they are unsure of the political leanings of their clergy, or say that there is a mix of both Republicans and Democrats in the religious leadership of their congregation. Most attenders \u2013 including majorities in both parties \u2013 are satisfied with the amount of political discussion they\u2019re hearing in sermons. About seven-in-ten say the sermons at their place of worship have about the right amount of political discussion, while 14% say there is not enough political talk and 11% say there is too much political talk in the sermons they hear. Furthermore, congregants tend to agree with their clergy when politics is discussed: Overall, about six-in-ten say they generally agree with their clergy about politics (62%), although Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say this (70% vs. 56%). The survey asked those who attend religious services at least a few times a year the extent to which religious leaders help inform their opinion about three social and political issues: abortion, immigration and global climate change. Four-in-ten religious service attenders have a lot of confidence in their clergy to provide useful guidance to inform their opinion on abortion. Smaller shares have a lot of trust in their clergy\u2019s guidance about immigration (20%) or global climate change (13%). Republican attenders are much more likely than Democrats who go to religious services to say they have a lot of confidence in their clergy to provide guidance about abortion (53% vs. 25%).

Connecticut (1940) and Everson v. Board of Education of Ewing Township (1947), that the First Amendment\u2019s Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause applied to the states.", "The two clauses say, \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d", "Before those two court decisions, courts had applied the religion clauses only to actions of the federal government.", "\nSoon after the Everson decision, the Supreme Court began specifically applying the religion clauses to activities in public schools.", "In its first such case , McCollum v. Board of Education (1948), the high court invalidated the practice of having religious instructors from different denominations enter public schools to offer religious lessons during the school day to students whose parents requested them.", "A key factor in the court\u2019s decision was that the lessons took place in the schools.", "Four years later, in Zorach v. Clauson , the court upheld an arrangement by which public schools excused students during the school day so they could attend religious classes away from school property.", "(The new Pew Research Center survey finds that one-in-ten religiously affiliated teens in public school leave the school for religious activities.)", "\nBeginning in the 1960s, the court handed religious conservatives a series of major defeats.", "It began with the landmark 1962 ruling, Engel v. Vitale , that school-sponsored prayer \u2013 even nonsectarian prayer \u2013 violated the Establishment Clause.", "Since then, the Supreme Court has pushed forward, from banning organized Bible reading for religious and moral instruction in 1963 to prohibiting school-sponsored prayers at high school football games in 2000.", "(The new survey finds that 8% of teens in public school have ever seen a teacher lead the class in prayer, and the same share have ever had a teacher read to the class from the Bible as an example of literature.)", "\nIn these and other decisions, the court has repeatedly stressed that the Constitution prohibits public schools from indoctrinating children in religion.", "But it is not always easy to determine exactly what constitutes indoctrination or school sponsorship of religious activities.", "For example, can a class on the Bible as literature be taught without a bias for or against the idea that the Bible is religious truth?", "Can students be compelled to participate in a Christmas-themed music program?", "Sometimes students themselves, rather than teachers, administrators or coaches, bring faith into school activities.", "For instance, when a student invokes gratitude to God in a valedictory address, or a high school football player offers a prayer in a huddle, is the school legally responsible for their religious expression?", "\nThe issues are complicated by other constitutional guarantees.", "For instance, the First Amendment also protects freedom of speech and freedom of association.", "Religious groups have cited those guarantees in support of student religious speech and in efforts to obtain school sponsorship and resources for student religious clubs.", "\nThe right of a student or student club to engage in religious speech or activities on school property may, however, conflict with other protections, such as the right of students to avoid harassment.", "In one case, for example, a federal appeals court approved a high school\u2019s decision to prohibit a student from wearing a T-shirt containing a biblical passage condemning homosexuality.", "Because the student had graduated by the time the Supreme Court granted his appeal, the Supreme Court ordered the lower court to vacate its ruling and dismiss the case.", "\nIn another instance of conflict, some student religious groups want the right to exclude students who do not share the groups\u2019 beliefs, specifically on questions of sexuality.", "For example, the Christian Legal Society (CLS), which has chapters in many law schools, requires those who serve in leadership positions to agree to a statement that renounces \u201cunbiblical behaviors,\u201d such as engaging in sexual relationships outside of heterosexual marriage.", "CLS sued a number of law schools after they denied the group official recognition because this leadership policy violated the schools\u2019 nondiscrimination policies.", "In one of these cases, the Supreme Court ruled against CLS, stating that these nondiscrimination policies were constitutional so long as they were viewpoint neutral and fairly applied to all groups seeking recognition on campus.\n", "As these more recent controversies show, public schools remain a battlefield where the religious interests of parents, students, administrators and teachers often clash.", "The conflicts affect many aspects of public education, including classroom curricula, high school football games, student clubs, graduation ceremonies.", "\nThe most enduring and controversial issue related to school-sponsored religious activities is classroom prayer.", "In Engel v. Vitale (1962), the Supreme Court held that the Establishment Clause prohibited the recitation of a school-sponsored prayer in public schools.", "Engel involved a simple and seemingly nonsectarian prayer composed especially for use in New York\u2019s public schools.", "In banning the prayer exercise entirely, the court did not rest its opinion on the grounds that unwilling students were coerced to pray; that would come much later.", "Rather, the court emphasized what it saw as the wrongs of having the government create and sponsor a religious activity.", "\nThe following year, the high court extended the principle outlined in Engel to a program of daily Bible reading.", "In Abington School District v. Schempp , the court ruled broadly that school sponsorship of religious exercises violates the Constitution.", "Schempp became the source of the enduring constitutional doctrine that all government action must have a predominantly secular purpose \u2013 a requirement that, according to the court, the Bible-reading exercise clearly could not satisfy.", "By insisting that religious expression be excluded from the formal curriculum, the Supreme Court was assuring parents that public schools would be officially secular and would not compete with parents in their children\u2019s religious upbringing.", "\nWith Engel and Schempp, the court outlined the constitutional standard for prohibiting school-sponsored religious expression, a doctrine the court has firmly maintained.", "In Stone v. Graham (1980), for instance, it found unconstitutional a Kentucky law requiring all public schools to post a copy of the Ten Commandments.", "And in Wallace v. Jaffree (1985), it overturned an Alabama law requiring public schools to set aside a moment each day for silent prayer or meditation.", "However, in a concurrent opinion in Wallace, Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor suggested that a moment of silence requirement might pass constitutional muster if it had a \u201csecular purpose.\u201d", "And in a subsequent 2009 case, Croft v. Perry , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld a Texas law mandating a moment of silence because it determined that, in passing the law, the state legislature had sufficiently articulated a secular purpose.", "\nBut while courts have given states some latitude in crafting moment of silence statutes, they have shown much less deference to laws or policies that involve actual prayer.", "In 2000, for instance, the Supreme Court ruled in Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe that schools may not sponsor student-recited prayer at high school football games.", "\nMore sweeping in its consequences is Lee v. Weisman (1992), which invalidated a school-sponsored prayer led by an invited clergyman at a public school commencement in Providence, Rhode Island.", "The court\u2019s 5-4 decision rested explicitly on the argument that graduating students were being forced to participate in a religious ceremony.", "The case effectively outlawed a practice that was customary in many communities across the country, thus fueling the conservative critique that the Supreme Court was inhospitable to public expressions of faith.", "\nSo far, lower appellate courts have not extended the principles of the school prayer decisions to university commencements (Chaudhuri v. Tennessee, 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, 1997; Tanford v. Brand, 7th Circuit, 1997).", "The 4th Circuit, however, found unconstitutional the practice of daily prayer at supper at the Virginia Military Institute.", "In that case, Mellen v. Bunting (2003), the appellate court reasoned that VMI\u2019s military-like environment tended to coerce participation by cadets.", "The decision was similar to an earlier ruling by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which found unconstitutional a policy of the U.S. service academies that all cadets and midshipmen attend Protestant, Catholic or Jewish chapel services on Sunday (Anderson v. Laird, 1972).", "For the court, the key element was the service academies\u2019 coercion of students to attend the religious activity.", "\nMost recently, in 2019, the Supreme Court declined to review a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision upholding the firing of a football coach at a public high school for praying on the field with his players after games.", "However, in a statement accompanying the denial of review, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. (joined by fellow conservative justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh) indicated the high court would be open to reviewing other cases involving similar issues.", "Alito wrote that the court denied review in this case due to \u201cimportant unresolved factual questions,\u201d and that \u201cthe 9th Circuit\u2019s understanding of free speech rights of public school teachers is troubling and may justify review in the future.\u201d", "\nIn 1954, Congress revised the Pledge of Allegiance to refer to the nation as \u201cunder God,\u201d a phrase that has since been recited by generations of schoolchildren.", "In 2000, Michael Newdow filed suit challenging the phrase on behalf of his daughter, a public school student in California.", "Newdow argued that the words \u201cunder God\u201d violated the Establishment Clause because they transformed the pledge into a religious exercise.", "\nThe case, Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow , reached the Supreme Court in 2004, but the justices did not ultimately decide whether the phrase was acceptable.", "Instead, the court ruled that Newdow lacked standing to bring the suit because he did not have legal custody of his daughter.", "In concurring opinions, however, four justices expressed the view that the Constitution permitted recitation of the pledge \u2013 with the phrase \u201cunder God\u201d \u2013 in public schools.", "\nWhile the issue never reached the Supreme Court again, it continued to be litigated in the lower courts.", "In Myers v. Loudoun County Public Schools (2005), the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld recitation of the pledge in Virginia, but a U.S. district court in California ruled the other way in another suit involving Michael Newdow and other parents.", "However, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2010 reversed the district court decision, ruling that the recitation of the pledge did not constitute an establishment of religion.", "\nThe courts have drawn a sharp distinction between officially sponsored religious speech, such as a benediction by an invited clergyman at a commencement ceremony, and private religious speech by students.", "The Supreme Court made clear in Lee v. Weisman (1992) that a clergyman\u2019s benediction at a public school event would violate the separation of church and state.", "Judges usually reach that same conclusion when school officials cooperate with students to produce student-delivered religious messages.", "But federal courts are more divided in cases involving students acting on their own to include a religious sentiment or prayer at a school commencement or a similar activity.", "\nSome courts, particularly in the South, have upheld the constitutionality of student-initiated religious speech, emphasizing the private origins of this kind of religious expression.", "As long as school officials did not encourage or explicitly approve the contents, those courts have upheld religious content in student commencement speeches.", "\nIn Adler v. Duval County School Board (1996), for example, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals approved a system at a Florida high school in which the senior class, acting independently of school officials, selected a class member to deliver a commencement address.", "School officials neither influenced the choice of speaker nor screened the speech.", "Under those circumstances, the appeals court ruled that the school was not responsible for the religious content of the address.", "\nOther courts, however, have invalidated school policies that permit student speakers to include religious sentiments in graduation addresses.", "One leading case is ACLU v. Black Horse Pike Regional Board of Education (1996), in which the senior class of a New Jersey public high school selected the student speaker by a vote without knowing in advance the contents of the student\u2019s remarks.", "The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals nevertheless ruled that the high school could not permit religious content in the commencement speech.", "The court reasoned that students attending the graduation ceremony were as coerced to acquiesce in a student-led prayer as they would be if the prayer were offered by a member of the clergy, the practice forbidden by Weisman in 1992.", "(Supreme Court Justice Samuel A.

School District of Palm Beach County (2004), the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Florida school officials were right to order the removal of student-created religious messages and symbols from a school beautification project.", "The court reasoned that the project was not intended as a forum for the expression of students\u2019 private views but rather as a school activity for which school officials would be held responsible.", "\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decisions about officially sponsored religious expression in schools consistently draw a distinction between religious activities such as worship or Bible reading, which are designed to inculcate religious sentiments and values, and \u201cteaching about religion,\u201d which is both constitutionally permissible and educationally appropriate.", "On several occasions, members of the court have suggested that public schools may teach \u201cthe Bible as literature,\u201d include lessons about the role of religion and religious institutions in history or offer courses on comparative religion.", "\nCourts have long grappled with attempts by school boards and other official bodies to change the curriculum in ways that directly promote or denigrate a particular religious tradition.", "Best known among these curriculum disputes are those involving the conflict between proponents and opponents of Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution , which explains the origin of species through evolution by means of natural selection.", "Opponents favor teaching some form of creationism, the idea that life came about as described in the biblical book of Genesis or evolved under the guidance of a supreme being.", "A recent alternative to Darwinism, intelligent design, asserts that life is too complex to have arisen without divine intervention.", "\nThe Supreme Court entered the evolution debate in 1968, when it ruled, in Epperson v.

Aguillard (1987), the Supreme Court struck down a Louisiana law that required \u201cbalanced treatment\u201d of evolution science and \u201ccreation science,\u201d so that any biology teacher who taught one also had to teach the other.", "The court said the law\u2019s purpose was to single out a particular religious belief \u2013 in this case, biblical creationism \u2013 and promote it as an alternative to accepted scientific theory.", "The court also pointed to evidence that the legislation\u2019s sponsor hoped that the balanced treatment requirement would lead science teachers to abandon the teaching of evolution.", "\nLower courts consistently have followed the lead of Epperson and Edwards.", "As a result, school boards have lost virtually every fight over curriculum changes designed to challenge evolution, including disclaimers in biology textbooks.", "One of the most recent and notable of these cases, Kitzmiller v.

University of Virginia (1995) and Good News Club v. Milford Central School District (2001).", "In Rosenberger, the Supreme Court held 5-4 that the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment required a state university to grant the same printing subsidy to an evangelical journal that it made available to all other student journals.", "The dissenters argued, unsuccessfully, that state financial support for a proselytizing journal violated the Establishment Clause.", "In Good News Club, a 6-3 majority held that the Free Speech Clause prohibited an elementary school from excluding an evangelical Christian program for children from the list of accepted after-school activities.", "\nThese equal access decisions have led to new controversies in the lower courts.", "In Child Evangelism Fellowship of Maryland v.

Questions about religion in the classroom no longer make quite as many headlines as they once did, but the issue remains an important battleground in the broader conflict over religion\u2019s role in public life.\nSome Americans are troubled by what they see as an effort on the part of federal courts and civil liberties advocates to exclude God and religious sentiment from public schools. Such an effort, these Americans believe, infringes on the First Amendment right to free exercise of religion.\nMany civil libertarians and others, meanwhile, voice concern that conservative Christians and others are trying to impose their values on students. Federal courts, they point out, consistently have interpreted the First Amendment\u2019s prohibition on the establishment of religion to forbid state sponsorship of prayer and most other religious activities in public schools.\nThis debate centers on public schools; very few people are arguing that religious doctrine cannot be taught at private schools or that teachers at such schools cannot lead students in prayer. And even in public institutions, there is little debate about the right of individual students, teachers and other school employees to practice their religion \u2013 by, say, praying before lunch or wearing religious clothing or symbols.\nMoreover, as a 2019 survey of American teens shows some forms of religious expression are relatively common in public schools. For instance, about four-in-ten public school students say they routinely see other students praying before sporting events, according to the survey. And about half of U.S. teens in public schools (53%) say they often or sometimes see other students wearing jewelry or clothing with religious symbols.\nThis analysis, updated on Oct. 3, 2019, was originally published in 2007 as part of a larger series that explored different aspects of the complex and fluid relationship between government and religion. This report includes sections on school prayer, the pledge of allegiance, religion in school curricula, and the religious liberty rights of students and teachers.\nThe report does not address questions of government funding for religious schools (that is, school vouchers and tax credits) because the schools in question are largely private, not public. For a discussion of vouchers and similar issues, see \u201c Shifting Boundaries: The Establishment Clause and Government Funding of Religious Schools and Other Faith-Based Organizations .\u201d Because that analysis was published in 2009 and has not been updated, it does not include a discussion of more recent Supreme Court voucher rulings or upcoming cases .\nConflicts over religion in school are hardly new. In the 19th century, Protestants and Catholics frequently fought over Bible reading and prayer in public schools. The disputes then were over which Bible and which prayers were appropriate to use in the classroom. Some Catholics were troubled that the schools\u2019 reading materials included the King James version of the Bible, which was favored by Protestants. In 1844, fighting broke out between Protestants and Catholics in Philadelphia; a number of people died in the violence and several Catholic churches were burned. Similar conflicts erupted during the 1850s in Boston and other parts of New England. In the early 20th century, liberal Protestants and their secular allies battled religious conservatives over whether students in biology classes should be taught Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution.\nThe Legal Status of Religious Organizations in Civil Lawsuits\nMarch 2011\nAre legal disputes involving churches and other religious institutions constitutionally different from those involving their secular counterparts, and if so, how?\nGovernment Funding of Faith-Based Organizations\nMay 2009\nThe debate over the meaning of the Establishment Clause.\nFree Exercise and the Legislative and Executive Branches\nOctober 2008\nA look at state and federal statutes that protect religious freedom.\nFree Exercise and the Courts\nOctober 2007\nThe courts have grappled with the meaning of the Free Exercise Clause.\nReligious Displays and the Courts\nJune 2007\nGovernment displays of religious symbols have sparked fierce battles.\nThe Supreme Court stepped into those controversies when it ruled, in Cantwell v. Connecticut (1940) and Everson v. Board of Education of Ewing Township (1947), that the First Amendment\u2019s Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause applied to the states. The two clauses say, \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d Before those two court decisions, courts had applied the religion clauses only to actions of the federal government.\nSoon after the Everson decision, the Supreme Court began specifically applying the religion clauses to activities in public schools. In its first such case , McCollum v. Board of Education (1948), the high court invalidated the practice of having religious instructors from different denominations enter public schools to offer religious lessons during the school day to students whose parents requested them. A key factor in the court\u2019s decision was that the lessons took place in the schools. Four years later, in Zorach v. Clauson , the court upheld an arrangement by which public schools excused students during the school day so they could attend religious classes away from school property. (The new Pew Research Center survey finds that one-in-ten religiously affiliated teens in public school leave the school for religious activities.)\nBeginning in the 1960s, the court handed religious conservatives a series of major defeats. It began with the landmark 1962 ruling, Engel v. Vitale , that school-sponsored prayer \u2013 even nonsectarian prayer \u2013 violated the Establishment Clause. Since then, the Supreme Court has pushed forward, from banning organized Bible reading for religious and moral instruction in 1963 to prohibiting school-sponsored prayers at high school football games in 2000. (The new survey finds that 8% of teens in public school have ever seen a teacher lead the class in prayer, and the same share have ever had a teacher read to the class from the Bible as an example of literature.)\nIn these and other decisions, the court has repeatedly stressed that the Constitution prohibits public schools from indoctrinating children in religion. But it is not always easy to determine exactly what constitutes indoctrination or school sponsorship of religious activities. For example, can a class on the Bible as literature be taught without a bias for or against the idea that the Bible is religious truth? Can students be compelled to participate in a Christmas-themed music program? Sometimes students themselves, rather than teachers, administrators or coaches, bring faith into school activities. For instance, when a student invokes gratitude to God in a valedictory address, or a high school football player offers a prayer in a huddle, is the school legally responsible for their religious expression?\nThe issues are complicated by other constitutional guarantees. For instance, the First Amendment also protects freedom of speech and freedom of association. Religious groups have cited those guarantees in support of student religious speech and in efforts to obtain school sponsorship and resources for student religious clubs.\nThe right of a student or student club to engage in religious speech or activities on school property may, however, conflict with other protections, such as the right of students to avoid harassment. In one case, for example, a federal appeals court approved a high school\u2019s decision to prohibit a student from wearing a T-shirt containing a biblical passage condemning homosexuality. Because the student had graduated by the time the Supreme Court granted his appeal, the Supreme Court ordered the lower court to vacate its ruling and dismiss the case.\nIn another instance of conflict, some student religious groups want the right to exclude students who do not share the groups\u2019 beliefs, specifically on questions of sexuality. For example, the Christian Legal Society (CLS), which has chapters in many law schools, requires those who serve in leadership positions to agree to a statement that renounces \u201cunbiblical behaviors,\u201d such as engaging in sexual relationships outside of heterosexual marriage. CLS sued a number of law schools after they denied the group official recognition because this leadership policy violated the schools\u2019 nondiscrimination policies. In one of these cases, the Supreme Court ruled against CLS, stating that these nondiscrimination policies were constitutional so long as they were viewpoint neutral and fairly applied to all groups seeking recognition on campus.\nAs these more recent controversies show, public schools remain a battlefield where the religious interests of parents, students, administrators and teachers often clash. The conflicts affect many aspects of public education, including classroom curricula, high school football games, student clubs, graduation ceremonies.\nThe most enduring and controversial issue related to school-sponsored religious activities is classroom prayer. In Engel v. Vitale (1962), the Supreme Court held that the Establishment Clause prohibited the recitation of a school-sponsored prayer in public schools. Engel involved a simple and seemingly nonsectarian prayer composed especially for use in New York\u2019s public schools. In banning the prayer exercise entirely, the court did not rest its opinion on the grounds that unwilling students were coerced to pray; that would come much later. Rather, the court emphasized what it saw as the wrongs of having the government create and sponsor a religious activity.\nThe following year, the high court extended the principle outlined in Engel to a program of daily Bible reading. In Abington School District v. Schempp , the court ruled broadly that school sponsorship of religious exercises violates the Constitution. Schempp became the source of the enduring constitutional doctrine that all government action must have a predominantly secular purpose \u2013 a requirement that, according to the court, the Bible-reading exercise clearly could not satisfy. By insisting that religious expression be excluded from the formal curriculum, the Supreme Court was assuring parents that public schools would be officially secular and would not compete with parents in their children\u2019s religious upbringing.\nWith Engel and Schempp, the court outlined the constitutional standard for prohibiting school-sponsored religious expression, a doctrine the court has firmly maintained. In Stone v. Graham (1980), for instance, it found unconstitutional a Kentucky law requiring all public schools to post a copy of the Ten Commandments. And in Wallace v. Jaffree (1985), it overturned an Alabama law requiring public schools to set aside a moment each day for silent prayer or meditation. However, in a concurrent opinion in Wallace, Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor suggested that a moment of silence requirement might pass constitutional muster if it had a \u201csecular purpose.\u201d And in a subsequent 2009 case, Croft v. Perry , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld a Texas law mandating a moment of silence because it determined that, in passing the law, the state legislature had sufficiently articulated a secular purpose.\nBut while courts have given states some latitude in crafting moment of silence statutes, they have shown much less deference to laws or policies that involve actual prayer. In 2000, for instance, the Supreme Court ruled in Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe that schools may not sponsor student-recited prayer at high school football games.\nMore sweeping in its consequences is Lee v. Weisman (1992), which invalidated a school-sponsored prayer led by an invited clergyman at a public school commencement in Providence, Rhode Island. The court\u2019s 5-4 decision rested explicitly on the argument that graduating students were being forced to participate in a religious ceremony. The case effectively outlawed a practice that was customary in many communities across the country, thus fueling the conservative critique that the Supreme Court was inhospitable to public expressions of faith.\nSo far, lower appellate courts have not extended the principles of the school prayer decisions to university commencements (Chaudhuri v. Tennessee, 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, 1997; Tanford v. Brand, 7th Circuit, 1997). The 4th Circuit, however, found unconstitutional the practice of daily prayer at supper at the Virginia Military Institute. In that case, Mellen v. Bunting (2003), the appellate court reasoned that VMI\u2019s military-like environment tended to coerce participation by cadets. The decision was similar to an earlier ruling by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which found unconstitutional a policy of the U.S. service academies that all cadets and midshipmen attend Protestant, Catholic or Jewish chapel services on Sunday (Anderson v. Laird, 1972). For the court, the key element was the service academies\u2019 coercion of students to attend the religious activity.\nMost recently, in 2019, the Supreme Court declined to review a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision upholding the firing of a football coach at a public high school for praying on the field with his players after games. However, in a statement accompanying the denial of review, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. (joined by fellow conservative justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh) indicated the high court would be open to reviewing other cases involving similar issues. Alito wrote that the court denied review in this case due to \u201cimportant unresolved factual questions,\u201d and that \u201cthe 9th Circuit\u2019s understanding of free speech rights of public school teachers is troubling and may justify review in the future.\u201d\nIn 1954, Congress revised the Pledge of Allegiance to refer to the nation as \u201cunder God,\u201d a phrase that has since been recited by generations of schoolchildren. In 2000, Michael Newdow filed suit challenging the phrase on behalf of his daughter, a public school student in California. Newdow argued that the words \u201cunder God\u201d violated the Establishment Clause because they transformed the pledge into a religious exercise.\nThe case, Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow , reached the Supreme Court in 2004, but the justices did not ultimately decide whether the phrase was acceptable. Instead, the court ruled that Newdow lacked standing to bring the suit because he did not have legal custody of his daughter. In concurring opinions, however, four justices expressed the view that the Constitution permitted recitation of the pledge \u2013 with the phrase \u201cunder God\u201d \u2013 in public schools.\nWhile the issue never reached the Supreme Court again, it continued to be litigated in the lower courts. In Myers v. Loudoun County Public Schools (2005), the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld recitation of the pledge in Virginia, but a U.S. district court in California ruled the other way in another suit involving Michael Newdow and other parents. However, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2010 reversed the district court decision, ruling that the recitation of the pledge did not constitute an establishment of religion.\nThe courts have drawn a sharp distinction between officially sponsored religious speech, such as a benediction by an invited clergyman at a commencement ceremony, and private religious speech by students. The Supreme Court made clear in Lee v. Weisman (1992) that a clergyman\u2019s benediction at a public school event would violate the separation of church and state. Judges usually reach that same conclusion when school officials cooperate with students to produce student-delivered religious messages. But federal courts are more divided in cases involving students acting on their own to include a religious sentiment or prayer at a school commencement or a similar activity.\nSome courts, particularly in the South, have upheld the constitutionality of student-initiated religious speech, emphasizing the private origins of this kind of religious expression. As long as school officials did not encourage or explicitly approve the contents, those courts have upheld religious content in student commencement speeches.\nIn Adler v. Duval County School Board (1996), for example, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals approved a system at a Florida high school in which the senior class, acting independently of school officials, selected a class member to deliver a commencement address. School officials neither influenced the choice of speaker nor screened the speech. Under those circumstances, the appeals court ruled that the school was not responsible for the religious content of the address.\nOther courts, however, have invalidated school policies that permit student speakers to include religious sentiments in graduation addresses. One leading case is ACLU v. Black Horse Pike Regional Board of Education (1996), in which the senior class of a New Jersey public high school selected the student speaker by a vote without knowing in advance the contents of the student\u2019s remarks. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals nevertheless ruled that the high school could not permit religious content in the commencement speech. The court reasoned that students attending the graduation ceremony were as coerced to acquiesce in a student-led prayer as they would be if the prayer were offered by a member of the clergy, the practice forbidden by Weisman in 1992. (Supreme Court Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who was then a member of the appeals court, joined a dissenting opinion in the case, arguing that the graduating students\u2019 rights to religious and expressive freedom should prevail over the Establishment Clause concerns.)\nSimilarly, in Bannon v. School District of Palm Beach County (2004), the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Florida school officials were right to order the removal of student-created religious messages and symbols from a school beautification project. The court reasoned that the project was not intended as a forum for the expression of students\u2019 private views but rather as a school activity for which school officials would be held responsible.\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decisions about officially sponsored religious expression in schools consistently draw a distinction between religious activities such as worship or Bible reading, which are designed to inculcate religious sentiments and values, and \u201cteaching about religion,\u201d which is both constitutionally permissible and educationally appropriate. On several occasions, members of the court have suggested that public schools may teach \u201cthe Bible as literature,\u201d include lessons about the role of religion and religious institutions in history or offer courses on comparative religion.\nCourts have long grappled with attempts by school boards and other official bodies to change the curriculum in ways that directly promote or denigrate a particular religious tradition. Best known among these curriculum disputes are those involving the conflict between proponents and opponents of Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution , which explains the origin of species through evolution by means of natural selection. Opponents favor teaching some form of creationism, the idea that life came about as described in the biblical book of Genesis or evolved under the guidance of a supreme being. A recent alternative to Darwinism, intelligent design, asserts that life is too complex to have arisen without divine intervention.\nThe Supreme Court entered the evolution debate in 1968, when it ruled, in Epperson v. Arkansas , that Arkansas could not eliminate from the high school biology curriculum the teaching of \u201cthe theory that mankind descended from a lower order of animals.\u201d Arkansas\u2019 exclusion of that aspect of evolutionary theory, the court reasoned, was based on a preference for the account of creation in the book of Genesis and thus violated the state\u2019s constitutional obligation of religious neutrality.\nAlmost 20 years later, in Edwards v. Aguillard (1987), the Supreme Court struck down a Louisiana law that required \u201cbalanced treatment\u201d of evolution science and \u201ccreation science,\u201d so that any biology teacher who taught one also had to teach the other. The court said the law\u2019s purpose was to single out a particular religious belief \u2013 in this case, biblical creationism \u2013 and promote it as an alternative to accepted scientific theory. The court also pointed to evidence that the legislation\u2019s sponsor hoped that the balanced treatment requirement would lead science teachers to abandon the teaching of evolution.\nLower courts consistently have followed the lead of Epperson and Edwards. As a result, school boards have lost virtually every fight over curriculum changes designed to challenge evolution, including disclaimers in biology textbooks. One of the most recent and notable of these cases, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District (2005), involved a challenge to a Pennsylvania school district\u2019s policy of informing high school science students about intelligent design as an alternative to evolution. After lengthy testimony from both proponents and opponents of intelligent design, a federal district court in Pennsylvania concluded that the policy violates the Establishment Clause because intelligent design is a religious, rather than scientific, theory.\nKitzmiller may have been the last major evolution case to make national headlines, but the debate over how to teach about the origins and development of life in public schools has continued in state legislatures, boards of education and other public bodies. In 2019, for instance, policies that could affect the way evolution is taught in public school (often by limiting discussion of \u201ccontroversial issues\u201d) were introduced and in some cases debated in several states, including Arizona, Florida, Maine, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Virginia.\nCourts have also expended substantial time and energy considering public school programs that involve Bible study. Although the Supreme Court has occasionally referred to the permissibility of teaching the Bible as literature, some school districts have instituted Bible study programs that courts have found unconstitutional. Frequently, judges have concluded that these courses are thinly disguised efforts to teach a particular understanding of the New Testament.\nIn a number of these cases, school districts have brought in outside groups to run the Bible study program. The groups, in turn, hired their own teachers, in some cases Bible college students or members of the clergy who did not meet state accreditation standards.\nSuch Bible study programs have generally been held unconstitutional because, the courts conclude, they teach the Bible as religious truth or are designed to inculcate particular religious sentiments. For a public school class to study the Bible without violating constitutional limits, the class would have to include critical rather than devotional readings and allow open inquiry into the history and content of biblical passages.\nChristmas-themed music programs also have raised constitutional concerns. For a holiday music program to be constitutionally sound, the courts maintain, school officials must ensure the predominance of secular considerations, such as the program\u2019s educational value or the musical qualities of the pieces. The schools also must be sensitive to the possibility that some students will feel coerced to participate in the program (Bauchman v. West High School, 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, 1997; Doe v. Duncanville Independent School District, 5th Circuit, 1995). Moreover, the courts have said, no student should be forced to sing or play music that offends their religious sensibilities. Therefore, schools must allow students the option not to participate.\nNot all the cases involving religion in the curriculum concern the promotion of the beliefs of the majority. Indeed, challenges have come from Christian groups arguing that school policies discriminate against Christianity by promoting cultural pluralism.\nIn one example, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals considered a New York City Department of Education policy regulating the types of symbols displayed during the holiday seasons of various religions. The department allows the display of a menorah as a symbol for Hanukkah and a star and crescent to evoke Ramadan but permits the display of only secular symbols of Christmas, such as a Christmas tree; it explicitly forbids the display of a Christmas nativity scene in public schools.\nUpholding the city\u2019s policy, the Court of Appeals reasoned in Skoros v. Klein (2006) that city officials intended to promote cultural pluralism in the highly diverse setting of the New York City public schools. The court concluded that a \u201creasonable observer\u201d would understand that the star and crescent combination and the menorah had secular as well as religious meanings. The judicial panel ruled that the policy, therefore, did not promote Judaism or Islam and did not denigrate Christianity.\nIn another high-profile case, Citizens for a Responsible Curriculum v. Montgomery County Public Schools (2005), a Maryland citizens\u2019 group successfully challenged a health education curriculum that included discussion of sexual orientation. Ordinarily, opponents of homosexuality could not confidently cite the Establishment Clause as the basis for a complaint, because the curriculum typically would not advance a particular religious perspective. However, the Montgomery County curriculum included materials in teacher guides that disparaged some religious teachings on homosexuality as theologically flawed and contrasted those teachings with what the guide portrayed as the more acceptable and tolerant views of some other faiths. The district court concluded that the curriculum had both the purpose and effect of advancing certain faiths while denigrating the beliefs of others. The county rewrote these materials to exclude any reference to the views of particular faiths, making them more difficult to challenge successfully in court because the lessons did not condemn or praise any faith tradition.\nAt the time of its school prayer decisions in the early 1960s, the Supreme Court had never ruled on whether students have the right of free speech inside public schools. By the end of that decade, however, the court began to consider the question. And the results have made the rules for religious expression far more complex.\nThe leading Supreme Court decision on freedom of student speech is Tinker v. Des Moines School District (1969), , which upheld the right of students to wear armbands protesting the Vietnam War. The court ruled that school authorities may not suppress expression by students unless the expression significantly disrupts school discipline or invades the rights of others.\nThis endorsement of students\u2019 freedom of speech did not entirely clarify things for school officials trying to determine students\u2019 rights. Tinker supported student expression, but it did not attempt to reconcile that right of expression with the Supreme Court\u2019s earlier decisions forbidding student participation in school-sponsored prayer and Bible reading. Some school officials responded to the mix of student liberties and restraints by forbidding certain forms of student-initiated religious expression such as the saying of grace before lunch in the school cafeteria, student-sponsored gatherings for prayer at designated spots on school property, or student proselytizing aimed at other students.\nAfter years of uncertainty about these matters, several interest groups devoted to religious freedom and civil liberties drafted a set of guidelines, \u201cReligious Expression in Public Schools,\u201d which the U.S. Department of Education sent to every public school superintendent in 1995. The department revised the guidelines in 2003, placing somewhat greater emphasis on the rights of students to speak or associate for religious purposes. The guidelines highlight these four general principles:\n- Students, acting on their own, have the same right to engage in religious activity and discussion as they do to engage in comparable secular activities.\n- Students may offer a prayer or blessing before meals in school or assemble on school grounds for religious purposes to the same extent as other students who wish to express their personal views or assemble with others. (The new survey finds that 26% of religiously affiliated teens in public school say they often or sometimes pray before eating lunch.)\n- Students may not engage in religious harassment of others or compel other students to participate in religious expression, and schools may control aggressive and unwanted proselytizing.\n- Schools may neither favor nor disfavor students or groups on the basis of their religious identities.\nA case decided by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals underscores the difficulties that school officials still can face when students exercise their right to religious expression on school property. In this case, gay and lesbian students in a California high school organized a Day of Silence, in which students promoting tolerance of differences in sexual orientation refrained from speaking in school. The following day, Tyler Harper, a student at the school, wore a T-shirt that on the front read, \u201cBe Ashamed, Our School Has Embraced What God Has Condemned,\u201d and on the back, \u201cHomosexuality Is Shameful, Romans 1:27.\u201d School officials asked him to remove the shirt and took him out of class while they attempted to persuade him to do so.\nThe Court of Appeals, in Harper v. Poway Unified School District (2006), rejected Harper\u2019s claim that the school officials violated his First Amendment rights. Judge Stephen Reinhardt, writing for a 2- 1 majority and citing Tinker, argued that students\u2019 constitutional rights may be limited to prevent harming the rights of other students. He concluded that the T-shirt could be seen as violating school policies against harassment based on sexual orientation.\nWriting in dissent, Judge Alex Kozinski asserted that the school\u2019s sexual harassment policy was far too vague and sweeping to support a restriction on all anti-gay speech. He also argued that the school district had unlawfully discriminated against Harper\u2019s freedom of speech. By permitting the Gay and Lesbian Alliance to conduct the Day of Silence, Kozinski said, the district was choosing sides on a controversial social issue and stifling religiously motivated speech on one side of the issue.\nHarper petitioned the Supreme Court to review the appeals court decision. But Harper graduated from high school, and the case took a different turn. The Supreme Court, in early 2007, ordered the lower court to vacate its ruling and dismiss the case on the grounds that it had become moot.\nHarper highlighted a tension \u2013 one that may yet recur \u2013 between the rights of students to engage in religious expression and the rights of other students to be educated in a non-hostile environment. The Supreme Court eventually may clarify school officials\u2019 power to suppress speech as a means of protecting the rights of other students. For now, cases like Harper illustrate the difficulties for school officials in regulating student expression.\nParents sometimes complain that secular practices at school inhibit their right to direct the religious upbringing of their children. These complaints typically rest on both the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and the 14th Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, which forbids the state to deprive any person of \u201clife, liberty or property without due process of law.\u201d The Supreme Court has interpreted them as protecting the right of parents to shape and control the education of their children. When they object to certain school practices, the parents often seek permission for their children to skip the offending lesson or class \u2013 to opt out \u2013 rather than try to end the practice schoolwide.\nThe first decision by the Supreme Court on parents\u2019 rights to control their children\u2019s education came in Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925), which guarantees to parents the right to enroll their children in private rather than public schools, whether the private schools are religious or secular. In West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette (1943), the court upheld the right of public school students who were Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses to refuse to salute the American flag. The students said the flag represented a graven image and that their religion forbade them from recognizing it. The court\u2019s decision rested on the right of all students, not just those who are religiously motivated, to resist compulsory recitation of official orthodoxy, political or otherwise.\nOf all the Supreme Court rulings supporting religious opt-outs, perhaps the most significant came in Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972), which upheld the right of members of the Old Order Amish to withdraw their children from formal education at the age of 14. The court determined that a state law requiring children to attend school until the age of 16 burdened the free exercise of their families\u2019 religion. The Amish community had a well-established record as hardworking and law-abiding, the court noted, and Amish teens would receive home-based training. The worldly influences present in the school experience of teenagers, the court said, would undercut the continuity of agrarian life in the Amish community.\nIn later decisions, lower courts recognized religious opt-outs in other relatively narrow circumstances. Parents successfully cited religious grounds to win the right to remove their children from otherwise compulsory military training (Spence v. Bailey, 1972) and from a coeducational physical education class in which students had to dress in \u201cimmodest apparel\u201d (Moody v. Cronin, 1979). In Menora v. Illinois High School Association (1982), the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Illinois High School Association was constitutionally obliged to accommodate Orthodox Jewish basketball players who wanted to wear a head covering, despite an association rule forbidding headgear. The Menora case involves a narrow exception from the dress code, rather than a broader right to opt out of a curriculum requirement.\nA great many school districts, meanwhile, have recognized the force of parents\u2019 religious or moral concerns on issues of sexuality and reproduction and have voluntarily provided opt-outs from classes devoted to those topics. Under these opt-out programs, parents do not have to explain their objection, religious or otherwise, to participation by their children. On other occasions, however, parental claims that the Constitution entitles them to remove their children from part or all of a public school curriculum have fared rather poorly.\nThe issue of home schooling is a good example. Before state legislatures passed laws allowing home schooling, parents seeking to educate their children at home were often unsuccessful in the courts. Many judges distinguished these home schooling cases from Yoder on the grounds that Yoder involved teenagers rather than young children. The judges also noted that Yoder was concerned with the survival of an entire religious community \u2013 the Old Order Amish \u2013 rather than the impact of education on a single family. Indeed, in virtually all the cases decided over the past 25 years, courts have found that the challenged curriculum requirement did not unconstitutionally burden parents\u2019 religious choices.\nThe most famous of the cases is Mozert v. Hawkins County Board of Education (1987), in which a group of Tennessee parents complained that references to mental telepathy, evolution, secular humanism, feminism, pacifism and magic in a series of books in the reading curriculum offended the families\u2019 Christian beliefs. The school board originally allowed children to choose alternative reading materials but then eliminated that option.\nThe 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in the county\u2019s favor on the grounds that students were not being asked to do anything in conflict with their religious obligations. Furthermore, the court said, the school board had a strong interest in exposing children to a variety of ideas and images and in using a uniform series of books for all children. Because the books did not explicitly adopt or denigrate particular religious beliefs, the court concluded, the parents could insist neither on the removal of the books from the schools nor on their children opting out.\nThe 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reached a similar conclusion in a case involving a public high school in Massachusetts that held a mandatory assembly devoted to AIDS and sex education. In that case, Brown v. Hot, Sexy, and Safer Productions (1995), the court rejected a complaint brought by parents who alleged that exposure to sexually explicit material infringed on their rights to religious freedom and control of the upbringing of their children. The court concluded that this one-time exposure to the material would not substantially burden the parents\u2019 freedom to rear their children and that the school authorities had strong reasons to inform high school students about \u201csafe sex.\u201d\nMore recently, parents and students have, on religious liberty and other grounds, sued school districts that accommodate transgender students by allowing them to use bathroom and locker facilities that match their current gender identity rather than their sex at birth. Some parents and students argue that the new arrangements violate their religious liberty rights because the school policy forces them to accommodate a set of moral and religious beliefs they disagree with.\nSo far, however, federal courts have sided with school districts that have accommodated transgender students. For instance, in Parents for Privacy v. Dallas School District No. 2, a federal district court dismissed a suit against Oregon\u2019s Dallas school district, stating that accommodating transgender students does not impinge on the religious rights of other students or their parents. And in 2019, the Supreme Court declined to review Doe v. Boyertown Area School District, letting stand a 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling upholding a Pennsylvania school district\u2019s policy to accommodate transgender students.\nWithout question, public school employees retain their rights to free exercise of religion. When off duty, school employees are free to engage in worship, proselytizing or any other lawful faith-based activity. When they are acting as representatives of a public school system, however, courts have said their rights are constrained by the Establishment Clause.\nThis limitation on religious expression raises difficult questions. The first is what limits school systems may impose on the ordinary and incidental expression of religious identity by teachers in the classroom. Most school systems permit teachers to wear religious clothing or jewelry. Similarly, teachers may disclose their religious identity; for instance, they need not refuse to answer when a student asks, \u201cDo you celebrate Christmas or Hanukkah?\u201d or \u201cDid I see you at the Islamic center yesterday morning?\u201d\nAt times, however, teachers act in an uninvited and overtly religious manner toward students and are asked by school administrators to refrain. When those requests have led to litigation, administrators invariably have prevailed on the grounds that they are obliged (for constitutional and pedagogical reasons) to be sensitive to a teacher\u2019s coercive potential.\nIn Bishop v. Aronov (1991), for example, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a set of restrictions imposed by the University of Alabama on a professor of exercise physiology. Professor Phillip Bishop had been speaking regularly to his class about the role of his Christian beliefs in his work and had scheduled an optional class in which he offered a \u201cChristian perspective\u201d on human physiology. The court recognized the university\u2019s general authority to control the way in which instruction took place, noting that Bishop\u2019s academic freedom was not jeopardized since he retained the right to express his religious views in his published writing and elsewhere.\nIn Roberts v. Madigan (1990), a federal district court similarly upheld the authority of a public school principal in Colorado to order a fifth-grade teacher to take down a religious poster from the classroom wall and to remove books titled \u201cThe Bible in Pictures\u201d and \u201cThe Life of Jesus\u201d from the classroom library. The court also backed the principal\u2019s order that the teacher remove the Bible from his desktop and refrain from silently reading the Bible during instructional time. The court emphasized that school principals need such authority to prevent potential violations of the Establishment Clause and to protect students against a religiously coercive atmosphere.\nThat much is clear. What is less clear is how public school systems should draw the line between teachers\u2019 official duties and their own time. That was the key question in Wigg v. Sioux Falls School District (8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, 2004), in which a teacher sued the South Dakota school district for refusing to allow her to serve as an instructor in the Good News Club (an evangelical Christian group) that met after school hours at various public elementary schools in the district.\nA federal district court ruled that the teacher, Barbara Wigg, should be free to participate in the club but said the school district could insist that the teacher not participate at the school where she was employed. The appellate court affirmed the decision but went further in protecting the teacher\u2019s rights, concluding that the school district could not exclude her from the program at her own school. The court reasoned that once the school day ended, Wigg became a private citizen, leaving her free to be a Good News Club instructor at any school, including the one where she worked. The court ruled that no reasonable observer would perceive Wigg\u2019s after-school role as being carried out on behalf of the school district, even though the club met on school property.\nIn general, then, the courts have ruled that public schools have substantial discretion to regulate the religious expression of teachers during instructional hours, especially when students are required to be present. The courts have also ruled, however, that attempts by schools to extend that control into non-instructional hours constitute an overly broad intrusion on the teachers\u2019 religious freedom.\nOver the past 20 years, evangelical Christians and others have advanced the rights of religious organizations to have equal access to meeting space and other forms of recognition provided by public schools to students. These organizations have consistently succeeded in securing the same privileges provided by public schools to secular groups.\nTheir victories have not been based on a claim that religious groups have a right to official recognition simply because they want to practice or preach their religion; instead, these cases have been won on free-speech grounds.\nWhenever public schools recognize student extracurricular activities (for example, a student Republican club or an animal rights group), the schools are deemed to have created a forum for student expression. The constitutional rules governing the forum concept are complicated, but one consistent theme is that the state may not discriminate against a person or group seeking access to the forum based on that person\u2019s or group\u2019s viewpoint. In a now-lengthy line of decisions, the Supreme Court has ruled consistently that religious groups represent a particular viewpoint on the subjects they address and that officials may not exclude that viewpoint from a government-created forum for expression or association.\nThe first major decision in this area was Widmar v. Vincent (1981), , in which the Supreme Court ruled that the University of Missouri could not exclude from campus facilities a student group that wanted to use the school\u2019s buildings for worship and Bible study. The university had refused the group access, asserting that the Establishment Clause forbade the use of a public university\u2019s facilities for worship. The court rejected this defense, ruling that the university had allowed other student groups to use university property and that the complaining group could not be excluded on the basis of its religious viewpoint.\nThe Supreme Court later extended Widmar\u2019s notion of equal access to nonstudent groups. They, too, should have access to public space, the court said. Despite the decision in Widmar, however, some public high schools continued to refuse access to student religious groups. Those schools took the view that prayer and Bible reading in public schools were constitutionally impermissible, even if wholly student initiated. At least one court of appeals has upheld that argument.\nCongress responded by passing the Equal Access Act of 1984. As a condition for receiving federal financial aid, the law required that public secondary schools not discriminate on the basis of religion or political viewpoint in recognizing and supporting extracurricular activities. This law has benefited a variety of student organizations, from gay and lesbian groups to evangelical Christian clubs.\nIn 1985, a year after Congress passed the equal access law, school officials in Omaha, Nebraska, refused a student request for permission to form a Christian club at a public high school. The club\u2019s activities included reading and discussing the Bible and engaging in prayer. The students filed suit under the Equal Access Act, and the school officials responded that allowing such a club in a public school would violate the Establishment Clause.\nIn the court case, Board of Education v. Mergens (1990), the Supreme Court upheld the Equal Access Act. The 8-1 majority reasoned that high schools were indistinguishable from universities for purposes of equal access to public facilities. Because there were many student groups devoted to different and frequently opposing causes, the court determined that no reasonable observer would see the school\u2019s recognition of a religious group as an official endorsement of the group\u2019s religious views.\nThe limits of Widmar and Mergens were later put to the test in Rosenberger v. University of Virginia (1995) and Good News Club v. Milford Central School District (2001). In Rosenberger, the Supreme Court held 5-4 that the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment required a state university to grant the same printing subsidy to an evangelical journal that it made available to all other student journals. The dissenters argued, unsuccessfully, that state financial support for a proselytizing journal violated the Establishment Clause. In Good News Club, a 6-3 majority held that the Free Speech Clause prohibited an elementary school from excluding an evangelical Christian program for children from the list of accepted after-school activities.\nThese equal access decisions have led to new controversies in the lower courts. In Child Evangelism Fellowship of Maryland v. Montgomery County Public Schools (2006), for instance, a federal appellate court extended the equal access principle to fliers that schools distributed to students to take home for the purpose of informing parents about after-school activities. For years the county had distributed fliers for children\u2019s sports leagues and activities like the Boy Scouts. But it refused to distribute fliers for the after-school programs of the Child Evangelism Fellowship of Maryland, which are not held on school property. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that the county\u2019s flier distribution policy was unconstitutionally discriminatory.\nThe presence of student religious groups in public schools has raised one additional issue. At times these groups insist that their officers make specific religious commitments, such as accepting Jesus Christ as savior and maintaining sexual abstinence outside of heterosexual marriage. As a result, some students are excluded from joining the group or from its leadership ranks. In Hsu v. Roslyn Union Free School District No. 3 (1996), the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that the federal Equal Access Act gave students in an evangelical Christian group the right to maintain religious criteria for office. The court said the school\u2019s policy against religious discrimination by student groups was unenforceable in this instance.\nThe issue arrived at the Supreme Court in 2010 in a case involving a public law school\u2019s decision to deny official recognition to the Christian Legal Society (CLS), a nationwide, nondenominational organization of Christian lawyers, judges and law students. Although the case, Christian Legal Society v. Martinez, involved just one law school (the University of California, Hastings College of Law), other law schools around the country also had been sued by the organization for similar reasons. By the time the Supreme Court agreed to hear Martinez, lower federal courts in different cases had ruled both for and against the organization.\nThe case centered on Hastings\u2019 policies toward student organizations. Student groups that are officially recognized by Hastings enjoy certain privileges, including access to school facilities and funding. But CLS membership requirements effectively bar non-Christians from becoming voting members and non-celibate gays and lesbians from assuming leadership positions, which conflicts with the law school\u2019s stated policy of requiring registered student groups to accept any students as members. After Hastings refused to exempt CLS from the policy \u2013 known as the \u201call-comers\u201d policy \u2013 the group sued, claiming the policy violated its First and 14th Amendment rights to free speech, expressive association and freedom of religious expression. A federal district court and the Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit sided with Hastings, and CLS appealed to the Supreme Court.\nThe case was widely viewed as a contest between the right of free association and nondiscrimination policies. In its ruling, however, the court did not resolve any broad questions raised by this conflict. Instead, the 5-4 majority handed down a narrowly tailored decision that upheld the specific policy of Hastings Law School \u2013 the \u201call-comers\u201d policy \u2013 as long as it is applied in an evenhanded manner.\nWriting for the high court\u2019s majority, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that Hastings\u2019 policy requiring officially registered student groups to allow anyone to join does not unconstitutionally discriminate against groups with particular viewpoints or missions. Quite the contrary, she wrote, the policy is completely neutral since it requires all organizations to open their membership and leadership to all students. Ginsburg argued that it is CLS that wants an exemption from the policy and thus threatens its neutrality. Moreover, she wrote, an \u201call-comers\u201d policy is reasonable for an educational institution because it encourages all groups to accept and interact with students who hold diverse views. Finally, Ginsburg noted that even though the Christian Legal Society has been denied official recognition by the law school, the group can, and still does, freely operate on campus and is even allowed to use school facilities to hold meetings.\nWriting for the dissent, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. argued that by affirming Hastings\u2019 policy, the majority sacrificed core First Amendment principles in favor of political correctness and armed \u201cpublic educational institutions with a handy weapon for suppressing the speech of unpopular groups.\u201d In addition, Alito asserted, the majority overlooked certain evidence demonstrating that Hastings had singled out CLS because of its beliefs. Prior to the lawsuit, he said, many officially recognized groups on the Hastings campus \u2013 not just CLS \u2013 had membership requirements written into their bylaws that were discriminatory. Justice Alito also disputed the majority\u2019s contention that CLS, even without official recognition, can still effectively operate on campus, noting that the administration has ignored requests by the group to secure rooms for meetings and tables at campus events.\nThis report was written by Ira C.

Questions about religion in the classroom no longer make quite as many headlines as they once did, but the issue remains an important battleground in the broader conflict over religion\u2019s role in public life. Some Americans are troubled by what they see as an effort on the part of federal courts and civil liberties advocates to exclude God and religious sentiment from public schools. Such an effort, these Americans believe, infringes on the First Amendment right to free exercise of religion. Many civil libertarians and others, meanwhile, voice concern that conservative Christians and others are trying to impose their values on students. Federal courts, they point out, consistently have interpreted the First Amendment\u2019s prohibition on the establishment of religion to forbid state sponsorship of prayer and most other religious activities in public schools. This debate centers on public schools; very few people are arguing that religious doctrine cannot be taught at private schools or that teachers at such schools cannot lead students in prayer. And even in public institutions, there is little debate about the right of individual students, teachers and other school employees to practice their religion \u2013 by, say, praying before lunch or wearing religious clothing or symbols. Moreover, as a 2019 survey of American teens shows some forms of religious expression are relatively common in public schools. For instance, about four-in-ten public school students say they routinely see other students praying before sporting events, according to the survey. And about half of U.S. teens in public schools (53%) say they often or sometimes see other students wearing jewelry or clothing with religious symbols. This analysis, updated on Oct. 3, 2019, was originally published in 2007 as part of a larger series that explored different aspects of the complex and fluid relationship between government and religion. This report includes sections on school prayer, the pledge of allegiance, religion in school curricula, and the religious liberty rights of students and teachers. The report does not address questions of government funding for religious schools (that is, school vouchers and tax credits) because the schools in question are largely private, not public. For a discussion of vouchers and similar issues, see \u201c Shifting Boundaries: The Establishment Clause and Government Funding of Religious Schools and Other Faith-Based Organizations .\u201d Because that analysis was published in 2009 and has not been updated, it does not include a discussion of more recent Supreme Court voucher rulings or upcoming cases . Conflicts over religion in school are hardly new. In the 19th century, Protestants and Catholics frequently fought over Bible reading and prayer in public schools. The disputes then were over which Bible and which prayers were appropriate to use in the classroom. Some Catholics were troubled that the schools\u2019 reading materials included the King James version of the Bible, which was favored by Protestants. In 1844, fighting broke out between Protestants and Catholics in Philadelphia; a number of people died in the violence and several Catholic churches were burned. Similar conflicts erupted during the 1850s in Boston and other parts of New England. In the early 20th century, liberal Protestants and their secular allies battled religious conservatives over whether students in biology classes should be taught Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution.  The Legal Status of Religious Organizations in Civil Lawsuits  March 2011 Are legal disputes involving churches and other religious institutions constitutionally different from those involving their secular counterparts, and if so, how?  Government Funding of Faith-Based Organizations  May 2009 The debate over the meaning of the Establishment Clause.  Free Exercise and the Legislative and Executive Branches  October 2008 A look at state and federal statutes that protect religious freedom.  Free Exercise and the Courts  October 2007 The courts have grappled with the meaning of the Free Exercise Clause.  Religious Displays and the Courts  June 2007 Government displays of religious symbols have sparked fierce battles. The Supreme Court stepped into those controversies when it ruled, in Cantwell v. Connecticut (1940) and Everson v. Board of Education of Ewing Township (1947), that the First Amendment\u2019s Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause applied to the states. The two clauses say, \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d Before those two court decisions, courts had applied the religion clauses only to actions of the federal government. Soon after the Everson decision, the Supreme Court began specifically applying the religion clauses to activities in public schools. In its first such case , McCollum v. Board of Education (1948), the high court invalidated the practice of having religious instructors from different denominations enter public schools to offer religious lessons during the school day to students whose parents requested them. A key factor in the court\u2019s decision was that the lessons took place in the schools. Four years later, in Zorach v. Clauson , the court upheld an arrangement by which public schools excused students during the school day so they could attend religious classes away from school property. (The new Pew Research Center survey finds that one-in-ten religiously affiliated teens in public school leave the school for religious activities.) Beginning in the 1960s, the court handed religious conservatives a series of major defeats. It began with the landmark 1962 ruling, Engel v. Vitale , that school-sponsored prayer \u2013 even nonsectarian prayer \u2013 violated the Establishment Clause. Since then, the Supreme Court has pushed forward, from banning organized Bible reading for religious and moral instruction in 1963 to prohibiting school-sponsored prayers at high school football games in 2000. (The new survey finds that 8% of teens in public school have ever seen a teacher lead the class in prayer, and the same share have ever had a teacher read to the class from the Bible as an example of literature.) In these and other decisions, the court has repeatedly stressed that the Constitution prohibits public schools from indoctrinating children in religion. But it is not always easy to determine exactly what constitutes indoctrination or school sponsorship of religious activities. For example, can a class on the Bible as literature be taught without a bias for or against the idea that the Bible is religious truth? Can students be compelled to participate in a Christmas-themed music program? Sometimes students themselves, rather than teachers, administrators or coaches, bring faith into school activities. For instance, when a student invokes gratitude to God in a valedictory address, or a high school football player offers a prayer in a huddle, is the school legally responsible for their religious expression? The issues are complicated by other constitutional guarantees. For instance, the First Amendment also protects freedom of speech and freedom of association. Religious groups have cited those guarantees in support of student religious speech and in efforts to obtain school sponsorship and resources for student religious clubs. The right of a student or student club to engage in religious speech or activities on school property may, however, conflict with other protections, such as the right of students to avoid harassment. In one case, for example, a federal appeals court approved a high school\u2019s decision to prohibit a student from wearing a T-shirt containing a biblical passage condemning homosexuality. Because the student had graduated by the time the Supreme Court granted his appeal, the Supreme Court ordered the lower court to vacate its ruling and dismiss the case. In another instance of conflict, some student religious groups want the right to exclude students who do not share the groups\u2019 beliefs, specifically on questions of sexuality. For example, the Christian Legal Society (CLS), which has chapters in many law schools, requires those who serve in leadership positions to agree to a statement that renounces \u201cunbiblical behaviors,\u201d such as engaging in sexual relationships outside of heterosexual marriage. CLS sued a number of law schools after they denied the group official recognition because this leadership policy violated the schools\u2019 nondiscrimination policies. In one of these cases, the Supreme Court ruled against CLS, stating that these nondiscrimination policies were constitutional so long as they were viewpoint neutral and fairly applied to all groups seeking recognition on campus. As these more recent controversies show, public schools remain a battlefield where the religious interests of parents, students, administrators and teachers often clash. The conflicts affect many aspects of public education, including classroom curricula, high school football games, student clubs, graduation ceremonies. The most enduring and controversial issue related to school-sponsored religious activities is classroom prayer. In Engel v. Vitale (1962), the Supreme Court held that the Establishment Clause prohibited the recitation of a school-sponsored prayer in public schools. Engel involved a simple and seemingly nonsectarian prayer composed especially for use in New York\u2019s public schools. In banning the prayer exercise entirely, the court did not rest its opinion on the grounds that unwilling students were coerced to pray; that would come much later. Rather, the court emphasized what it saw as the wrongs of having the government create and sponsor a religious activity. The following year, the high court extended the principle outlined in Engel to a program of daily Bible reading. In Abington School District v. Schempp , the court ruled broadly that school sponsorship of religious exercises violates the Constitution. Schempp became the source of the enduring constitutional doctrine that all government action must have a predominantly secular purpose \u2013 a requirement that, according to the court, the Bible-reading exercise clearly could not satisfy. By insisting that religious expression be excluded from the formal curriculum, the Supreme Court was assuring parents that public schools would be officially secular and would not compete with parents in their children\u2019s religious upbringing. With Engel and Schempp, the court outlined the constitutional standard for prohibiting school-sponsored religious expression, a doctrine the court has firmly maintained. In Stone v. Graham (1980), for instance, it found unconstitutional a Kentucky law requiring all public schools to post a copy of the Ten Commandments. And in Wallace v. Jaffree (1985), it overturned an Alabama law requiring public schools to set aside a moment each day for silent prayer or meditation. However, in a concurrent opinion in Wallace, Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor suggested that a moment of silence requirement might pass constitutional muster if it had a \u201csecular purpose.\u201d And in a subsequent 2009 case, Croft v. Perry , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld a Texas law mandating a moment of silence because it determined that, in passing the law, the state legislature had sufficiently articulated a secular purpose. But while courts have given states some latitude in crafting moment of silence statutes, they have shown much less deference to laws or policies that involve actual prayer. In 2000, for instance, the Supreme Court ruled in Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe that schools may not sponsor student-recited prayer at high school football games. More sweeping in its consequences is Lee v. Weisman (1992), which invalidated a school-sponsored prayer led by an invited clergyman at a public school commencement in Providence, Rhode Island. The court\u2019s 5-4 decision rested explicitly on the argument that graduating students were being forced to participate in a religious ceremony. The case effectively outlawed a practice that was customary in many communities across the country, thus fueling the conservative critique that the Supreme Court was inhospitable to public expressions of faith. So far, lower appellate courts have not extended the principles of the school prayer decisions to university commencements (Chaudhuri v. Tennessee, 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, 1997; Tanford v. Brand, 7th Circuit, 1997). The 4th Circuit, however, found unconstitutional the practice of daily prayer at supper at the Virginia Military Institute. In that case, Mellen v. Bunting (2003), the appellate court reasoned that VMI\u2019s military-like environment tended to coerce participation by cadets. The decision was similar to an earlier ruling by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which found unconstitutional a policy of the U.S. service academies that all cadets and midshipmen attend Protestant, Catholic or Jewish chapel services on Sunday (Anderson v. Laird, 1972). For the court, the key element was the service academies\u2019 coercion of students to attend the religious activity. Most recently, in 2019, the Supreme Court declined to review a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision upholding the firing of a football coach at a public high school for praying on the field with his players after games. However, in a statement accompanying the denial of review, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. (joined by fellow conservative justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh) indicated the high court would be open to reviewing other cases involving similar issues. Alito wrote that the court denied review in this case due to \u201cimportant unresolved factual questions,\u201d and that \u201cthe 9th Circuit\u2019s understanding of free speech rights of public school teachers is troubling and may justify review in the future.\u201d In 1954, Congress revised the Pledge of Allegiance to refer to the nation as \u201cunder God,\u201d a phrase that has since been recited by generations of schoolchildren. In 2000, Michael Newdow filed suit challenging the phrase on behalf of his daughter, a public school student in California. Newdow argued that the words \u201cunder God\u201d violated the Establishment Clause because they transformed the pledge into a religious exercise. The case, Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow , reached the Supreme Court in 2004, but the justices did not ultimately decide whether the phrase was acceptable. Instead, the court ruled that Newdow lacked standing to bring the suit because he did not have legal custody of his daughter. In concurring opinions, however, four justices expressed the view that the Constitution permitted recitation of the pledge \u2013 with the phrase \u201cunder God\u201d \u2013 in public schools. While the issue never reached the Supreme Court again, it continued to be litigated in the lower courts. In Myers v. Loudoun County Public Schools (2005), the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld recitation of the pledge in Virginia, but a U.S. district court in California ruled the other way in another suit involving Michael Newdow and other parents. However, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2010 reversed the district court decision, ruling that the recitation of the pledge did not constitute an establishment of religion. The courts have drawn a sharp distinction between officially sponsored religious speech, such as a benediction by an invited clergyman at a commencement ceremony, and private religious speech by students. The Supreme Court made clear in Lee v. Weisman (1992) that a clergyman\u2019s benediction at a public school event would violate the separation of church and state. Judges usually reach that same conclusion when school officials cooperate with students to produce student-delivered religious messages. But federal courts are more divided in cases involving students acting on their own to include a religious sentiment or prayer at a school commencement or a similar activity. Some courts, particularly in the South, have upheld the constitutionality of student-initiated religious speech, emphasizing the private origins of this kind of religious expression. As long as school officials did not encourage or explicitly approve the contents, those courts have upheld religious content in student commencement speeches. In Adler v. Duval County School Board (1996), for example, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals approved a system at a Florida high school in which the senior class, acting independently of school officials, selected a class member to deliver a commencement address. School officials neither influenced the choice of speaker nor screened the speech. Under those circumstances, the appeals court ruled that the school was not responsible for the religious content of the address. Other courts, however, have invalidated school policies that permit student speakers to include religious sentiments in graduation addresses. One leading case is ACLU v. Black Horse Pike Regional Board of Education (1996), in which the senior class of a New Jersey public high school selected the student speaker by a vote without knowing in advance the contents of the student\u2019s remarks. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals nevertheless ruled that the high school could not permit religious content in the commencement speech. The court reasoned that students attending the graduation ceremony were as coerced to acquiesce in a student-led prayer as they would be if the prayer were offered by a member of the clergy, the practice forbidden by Weisman in 1992. (Supreme Court Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who was then a member of the appeals court, joined a dissenting opinion in the case, arguing that the graduating students\u2019 rights to religious and expressive freedom should prevail over the Establishment Clause concerns.) Similarly, in Bannon v. School District of Palm Beach County (2004), the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Florida school officials were right to order the removal of student-created religious messages and symbols from a school beautification project. The court reasoned that the project was not intended as a forum for the expression of students\u2019 private views but rather as a school activity for which school officials would be held responsible. The Supreme Court\u2019s decisions about officially sponsored religious expression in schools consistently draw a distinction between religious activities such as worship or Bible reading, which are designed to inculcate religious sentiments and values, and \u201cteaching about religion,\u201d which is both constitutionally permissible and educationally appropriate. On several occasions, members of the court have suggested that public schools may teach \u201cthe Bible as literature,\u201d include lessons about the role of religion and religious institutions in history or offer courses on comparative religion. Courts have long grappled with attempts by school boards and other official bodies to change the curriculum in ways that directly promote or denigrate a particular religious tradition. Best known among these curriculum disputes are those involving the conflict between proponents and opponents of Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution , which explains the origin of species through evolution by means of natural selection. Opponents favor teaching some form of creationism, the idea that life came about as described in the biblical book of Genesis or evolved under the guidance of a supreme being. A recent alternative to Darwinism, intelligent design, asserts that life is too complex to have arisen without divine intervention. The Supreme Court entered the evolution debate in 1968, when it ruled, in Epperson v. Arkansas , that Arkansas could not eliminate from the high school biology curriculum the teaching of \u201cthe theory that mankind descended from a lower order of animals.\u201d Arkansas\u2019 exclusion of that aspect of evolutionary theory, the court reasoned, was based on a preference for the account of creation in the book of Genesis and thus violated the state\u2019s constitutional obligation of religious neutrality. Almost 20 years later, in Edwards v. Aguillard (1987), the Supreme Court struck down a Louisiana law that required \u201cbalanced treatment\u201d of evolution science and \u201ccreation science,\u201d so that any biology teacher who taught one also had to teach the other. The court said the law\u2019s purpose was to single out a particular religious belief \u2013 in this case, biblical creationism \u2013 and promote it as an alternative to accepted scientific theory. The court also pointed to evidence that the legislation\u2019s sponsor hoped that the balanced treatment requirement would lead science teachers to abandon the teaching of evolution. Lower courts consistently have followed the lead of Epperson and Edwards. As a result, school boards have lost virtually every fight over curriculum changes designed to challenge evolution, including disclaimers in biology textbooks. One of the most recent and notable of these cases, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District (2005), involved a challenge to a Pennsylvania school district\u2019s policy of informing high school science students about intelligent design as an alternative to evolution. After lengthy testimony from both proponents and opponents of intelligent design, a federal district court in Pennsylvania concluded that the policy violates the Establishment Clause because intelligent design is a religious, rather than scientific, theory. Kitzmiller may have been the last major evolution case to make national headlines, but the debate over how to teach about the origins and development of life in public schools has continued in state legislatures, boards of education and other public bodies. In 2019, for instance, policies that could affect the way evolution is taught in public school (often by limiting discussion of \u201ccontroversial issues\u201d) were introduced and in some cases debated in several states, including Arizona, Florida, Maine, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Virginia. Courts have also expended substantial time and energy considering public school programs that involve Bible study. Although the Supreme Court has occasionally referred to the permissibility of teaching the Bible as literature, some school districts have instituted Bible study programs that courts have found unconstitutional. Frequently, judges have concluded that these courses are thinly disguised efforts to teach a particular understanding of the New Testament. In a number of these cases, school districts have brought in outside groups to run the Bible study program. The groups, in turn, hired their own teachers, in some cases Bible college students or members of the clergy who did not meet state accreditation standards. Such Bible study programs have generally been held unconstitutional because, the courts conclude, they teach the Bible as religious truth or are designed to inculcate particular religious sentiments. For a public school class to study the Bible without violating constitutional limits, the class would have to include critical rather than devotional readings and allow open inquiry into the history and content of biblical passages. Christmas-themed music programs also have raised constitutional concerns. For a holiday music program to be constitutionally sound, the courts maintain, school officials must ensure the predominance of secular considerations, such as the program\u2019s educational value or the musical qualities of the pieces. The schools also must be sensitive to the possibility that some students will feel coerced to participate in the program (Bauchman v. West High School, 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, 1997; Doe v. Duncanville Independent School District, 5th Circuit, 1995). Moreover, the courts have said, no student should be forced to sing or play music that offends their religious sensibilities. Therefore, schools must allow students the option not to participate. Not all the cases involving religion in the curriculum concern the promotion of the beliefs of the majority. Indeed, challenges have come from Christian groups arguing that school policies discriminate against Christianity by promoting cultural pluralism. In one example, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals considered a New York City Department of Education policy regulating the types of symbols displayed during the holiday seasons of various religions. The department allows the display of a menorah as a symbol for Hanukkah and a star and crescent to evoke Ramadan but permits the display of only secular symbols of Christmas, such as a Christmas tree; it explicitly forbids the display of a Christmas nativity scene in public schools. Upholding the city\u2019s policy, the Court of Appeals reasoned in Skoros v. Klein (2006) that city officials intended to promote cultural pluralism in the highly diverse setting of the New York City public schools. The court concluded that a \u201creasonable observer\u201d would understand that the star and crescent combination and the menorah had secular as well as religious meanings. The judicial panel ruled that the policy, therefore, did not promote Judaism or Islam and did not denigrate Christianity. In another high-profile case, Citizens for a Responsible Curriculum v. Montgomery County Public Schools (2005), a Maryland citizens\u2019 group successfully challenged a health education curriculum that included discussion of sexual orientation. Ordinarily, opponents of homosexuality could not confidently cite the Establishment Clause as the basis for a complaint, because the curriculum typically would not advance a particular religious perspective. However, the Montgomery County curriculum included materials in teacher guides that disparaged some religious teachings on homosexuality as theologically flawed and contrasted those teachings with what the guide portrayed as the more acceptable and tolerant views of some other faiths. The district court concluded that the curriculum had both the purpose and effect of advancing certain faiths while denigrating the beliefs of others. The county rewrote these materials to exclude any reference to the views of particular faiths, making them more difficult to challenge successfully in court because the lessons did not condemn or praise any faith tradition. At the time of its school prayer decisions in the early 1960s, the Supreme Court had never ruled on whether students have the right of free speech inside public schools. By the end of that decade, however, the court began to consider the question. And the results have made the rules for religious expression far more complex. The leading Supreme Court decision on freedom of student speech is Tinker v. Des Moines School District (1969), , which upheld the right of students to wear armbands protesting the Vietnam War. The court ruled that school authorities may not suppress expression by students unless the expression significantly disrupts school discipline or invades the rights of others. This endorsement of students\u2019 freedom of speech did not entirely clarify things for school officials trying to determine students\u2019 rights. Tinker supported student expression, but it did not attempt to reconcile that right of expression with the Supreme Court\u2019s earlier decisions forbidding student participation in school-sponsored prayer and Bible reading. Some school officials responded to the mix of student liberties and restraints by forbidding certain forms of student-initiated religious expression such as the saying of grace before lunch in the school cafeteria, student-sponsored gatherings for prayer at designated spots on school property, or student proselytizing aimed at other students. After years of uncertainty about these matters, several interest groups devoted to religious freedom and civil liberties drafted a set of guidelines, \u201cReligious Expression in Public Schools,\u201d which the U.S. Department of Education sent to every public school superintendent in 1995. The department revised the guidelines in 2003, placing somewhat greater emphasis on the rights of students to speak or associate for religious purposes. The guidelines highlight these four general principles: Students, acting on their own, have the same right to engage in religious activity and discussion as they do to engage in comparable secular activities. Students may offer a prayer or blessing before meals in school or assemble on school grounds for religious purposes to the same extent as other students who wish to express their personal views or assemble with others. (The new survey finds that 26% of religiously affiliated teens in public school say they often or sometimes pray before eating lunch.) Students may not engage in religious harassment of others or compel other students to participate in religious expression, and schools may control aggressive and unwanted proselytizing. Schools may neither favor nor disfavor students or groups on the basis of their religious identities. A case decided by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals underscores the difficulties that school officials still can face when students exercise their right to religious expression on school property. In this case, gay and lesbian students in a California high school organized a Day of Silence, in which students promoting tolerance of differences in sexual orientation refrained from speaking in school. The following day, Tyler Harper, a student at the school, wore a T-shirt that on the front read, \u201cBe Ashamed, Our School Has Embraced What God Has Condemned,\u201d and on the back, \u201cHomosexuality Is Shameful, Romans 1:27.\u201d School officials asked him to remove the shirt and took him out of class while they attempted to persuade him to do so. The Court of Appeals, in Harper v. Poway Unified School District (2006), rejected Harper\u2019s claim that the school officials violated his First Amendment rights. Judge Stephen Reinhardt, writing for a 2- 1 majority and citing Tinker, argued that students\u2019 constitutional rights may be limited to prevent harming the rights of other students. He concluded that the T-shirt could be seen as violating school policies against harassment based on sexual orientation. Writing in dissent, Judge Alex Kozinski asserted that the school\u2019s sexual harassment policy was far too vague and sweeping to support a restriction on all anti-gay speech. He also argued that the school district had unlawfully discriminated against Harper\u2019s freedom of speech. By permitting the Gay and Lesbian Alliance to conduct the Day of Silence, Kozinski said, the district was choosing sides on a controversial social issue and stifling religiously motivated speech on one side of the issue. Harper petitioned the Supreme Court to review the appeals court decision. But Harper graduated from high school, and the case took a different turn. The Supreme Court, in early 2007, ordered the lower court to vacate its ruling and dismiss the case on the grounds that it had become moot. Harper highlighted a tension \u2013 one that may yet recur \u2013 between the rights of students to engage in religious expression and the rights of other students to be educated in a non-hostile environment. The Supreme Court eventually may clarify school officials\u2019 power to suppress speech as a means of protecting the rights of other students. For now, cases like Harper illustrate the difficulties for school officials in regulating student expression. Parents sometimes complain that secular practices at school inhibit their right to direct the religious upbringing of their children. These complaints typically rest on both the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and the 14th Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, which forbids the state to deprive any person of \u201clife, liberty or property without due process of law.\u201d The Supreme Court has interpreted them as protecting the right of parents to shape and control the education of their children. When they object to certain school practices, the parents often seek permission for their children to skip the offending lesson or class \u2013 to opt out \u2013 rather than try to end the practice schoolwide. The first decision by the Supreme Court on parents\u2019 rights to control their children\u2019s education came in Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925), which guarantees to parents the right to enroll their children in private rather than public schools, whether the private schools are religious or secular. In West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette (1943), the court upheld the right of public school students who were Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses to refuse to salute the American flag. The students said the flag represented a graven image and that their religion forbade them from recognizing it. The court\u2019s decision rested on the right of all students, not just those who are religiously motivated, to resist compulsory recitation of official orthodoxy, political or otherwise. Of all the Supreme Court rulings supporting religious opt-outs, perhaps the most significant came in Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972), which upheld the right of members of the Old Order Amish to withdraw their children from formal education at the age of 14. The court determined that a state law requiring children to attend school until the age of 16 burdened the free exercise of their families\u2019 religion. The Amish community had a well-established record as hardworking and law-abiding, the court noted, and Amish teens would receive home-based training. The worldly influences present in the school experience of teenagers, the court said, would undercut the continuity of agrarian life in the Amish community. In later decisions, lower courts recognized religious opt-outs in other relatively narrow circumstances. Parents successfully cited religious grounds to win the right to remove their children from otherwise compulsory military training (Spence v. Bailey, 1972) and from a coeducational physical education class in which students had to dress in \u201cimmodest apparel\u201d (Moody v. Cronin, 1979). In Menora v. Illinois High School Association (1982), the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Illinois High School Association was constitutionally obliged to accommodate Orthodox Jewish basketball players who wanted to wear a head covering, despite an association rule forbidding headgear. The Menora case involves a narrow exception from the dress code, rather than a broader right to opt out of a curriculum requirement. A great many school districts, meanwhile, have recognized the force of parents\u2019 religious or moral concerns on issues of sexuality and reproduction and have voluntarily provided opt-outs from classes devoted to those topics. Under these opt-out programs, parents do not have to explain their objection, religious or otherwise, to participation by their children. On other occasions, however, parental claims that the Constitution entitles them to remove their children from part or all of a public school curriculum have fared rather poorly. The issue of home schooling is a good example. Before state legislatures passed laws allowing home schooling, parents seeking to educate their children at home were often unsuccessful in the courts. Many judges distinguished these home schooling cases from Yoder on the grounds that Yoder involved teenagers rather than young children. The judges also noted that Yoder was concerned with the survival of an entire religious community \u2013 the Old Order Amish \u2013 rather than the impact of education on a single family. Indeed, in virtually all the cases decided over the past 25 years, courts have found that the challenged curriculum requirement did not unconstitutionally burden parents\u2019 religious choices. The most famous of the cases is Mozert v. Hawkins County Board of Education (1987), in which a group of Tennessee parents complained that references to mental telepathy, evolution, secular humanism, feminism, pacifism and magic in a series of books in the reading curriculum offended the families\u2019 Christian beliefs. The school board originally allowed children to choose alternative reading materials but then eliminated that option. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in the county\u2019s favor on the grounds that students were not being asked to do anything in conflict with their religious obligations. Furthermore, the court said, the school board had a strong interest in exposing children to a variety of ideas and images and in using a uniform series of books for all children. Because the books did not explicitly adopt or denigrate particular religious beliefs, the court concluded, the parents could insist neither on the removal of the books from the schools nor on their children opting out. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reached a similar conclusion in a case involving a public high school in Massachusetts that held a mandatory assembly devoted to AIDS and sex education. In that case, Brown v. Hot, Sexy, and Safer Productions (1995), the court rejected a complaint brought by parents who alleged that exposure to sexually explicit material infringed on their rights to religious freedom and control of the upbringing of their children. The court concluded that this one-time exposure to the material would not substantially burden the parents\u2019 freedom to rear their children and that the school authorities had strong reasons to inform high school students about \u201csafe sex.\u201d More recently, parents and students have, on religious liberty and other grounds, sued school districts that accommodate transgender students by allowing them to use bathroom and locker facilities that match their current gender identity rather than their sex at birth. Some parents and students argue that the new arrangements violate their religious liberty rights because the school policy forces them to accommodate a set of moral and religious beliefs they disagree with. So far, however, federal courts have sided with school districts that have accommodated transgender students. For instance, in Parents for Privacy v. Dallas School District No. 2, a federal district court dismissed a suit against Oregon\u2019s Dallas school district, stating that accommodating transgender students does not impinge on the religious rights of other students or their parents. And in 2019, the Supreme Court declined to review Doe v. Boyertown Area School District, letting stand a 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling upholding a Pennsylvania school district\u2019s policy to accommodate transgender students. Without question, public school employees retain their rights to free exercise of religion. When off duty, school employees are free to engage in worship, proselytizing or any other lawful faith-based activity. When they are acting as representatives of a public school system, however, courts have said their rights are constrained by the Establishment Clause. This limitation on religious expression raises difficult questions. The first is what limits school systems may impose on the ordinary and incidental expression of religious identity by teachers in the classroom. Most school systems permit teachers to wear religious clothing or jewelry. Similarly, teachers may disclose their religious identity; for instance, they need not refuse to answer when a student asks, \u201cDo you celebrate Christmas or Hanukkah?\u201d or \u201cDid I see you at the Islamic center yesterday morning?\u201d At times, however, teachers act in an uninvited and overtly religious manner toward students and are asked by school administrators to refrain. When those requests have led to litigation, administrators invariably have prevailed on the grounds that they are obliged (for constitutional and pedagogical reasons) to be sensitive to a teacher\u2019s coercive potential. In Bishop v. Aronov (1991), for example, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a set of restrictions imposed by the University of Alabama on a professor of exercise physiology. Professor Phillip Bishop had been speaking regularly to his class about the role of his Christian beliefs in his work and had scheduled an optional class in which he offered a \u201cChristian perspective\u201d on human physiology. The court recognized the university\u2019s general authority to control the way in which instruction took place, noting that Bishop\u2019s academic freedom was not jeopardized since he retained the right to express his religious views in his published writing and elsewhere. In Roberts v. Madigan (1990), a federal district court similarly upheld the authority of a public school principal in Colorado to order a fifth-grade teacher to take down a religious poster from the classroom wall and to remove books titled \u201cThe Bible in Pictures\u201d and \u201cThe Life of Jesus\u201d from the classroom library. The court also backed the principal\u2019s order that the teacher remove the Bible from his desktop and refrain from silently reading the Bible during instructional time. The court emphasized that school principals need such authority to prevent potential violations of the Establishment Clause and to protect students against a religiously coercive atmosphere. That much is clear. What is less clear is how public school systems should draw the line between teachers\u2019 official duties and their own time. That was the key question in Wigg v. Sioux Falls School District (8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, 2004), in which a teacher sued the South Dakota school district for refusing to allow her to serve as an instructor in the Good News Club (an evangelical Christian group) that met after school hours at various public elementary schools in the district. A federal district court ruled that the teacher, Barbara Wigg, should be free to participate in the club but said the school district could insist that the teacher not participate at the school where she was employed. The appellate court affirmed the decision but went further in protecting the teacher\u2019s rights, concluding that the school district could not exclude her from the program at her own school. The court reasoned that once the school day ended, Wigg became a private citizen, leaving her free to be a Good News Club instructor at any school, including the one where she worked. The court ruled that no reasonable observer would perceive Wigg\u2019s after-school role as being carried out on behalf of the school district, even though the club met on school property. In general, then, the courts have ruled that public schools have substantial discretion to regulate the religious expression of teachers during instructional hours, especially when students are required to be present. The courts have also ruled, however, that attempts by schools to extend that control into non-instructional hours constitute an overly broad intrusion on the teachers\u2019 religious freedom. Over the past 20 years, evangelical Christians and others have advanced the rights of religious organizations to have equal access to meeting space and other forms of recognition provided by public schools to students. These organizations have consistently succeeded in securing the same privileges provided by public schools to secular groups. Their victories have not been based on a claim that religious groups have a right to official recognition simply because they want to practice or preach their religion; instead, these cases have been won on free-speech grounds. Whenever public schools recognize student extracurricular activities (for example, a student Republican club or an animal rights group), the schools are deemed to have created a forum for student expression. The constitutional rules governing the forum concept are complicated, but one consistent theme is that the state may not discriminate against a person or group seeking access to the forum based on that person\u2019s or group\u2019s viewpoint. In a now-lengthy line of decisions, the Supreme Court has ruled consistently that religious groups represent a particular viewpoint on the subjects they address and that officials may not exclude that viewpoint from a government-created forum for expression or association. The first major decision in this area was Widmar v. Vincent (1981), , in which the Supreme Court ruled that the University of Missouri could not exclude from campus facilities a student group that wanted to use the school\u2019s buildings for worship and Bible study. The university had refused the group access, asserting that the Establishment Clause forbade the use of a public university\u2019s facilities for worship. The court rejected this defense, ruling that the university had allowed other student groups to use university property and that the complaining group could not be excluded on the basis of its religious viewpoint. The Supreme Court later extended Widmar\u2019s notion of equal access to nonstudent groups. They, too, should have access to public space, the court said. Despite the decision in Widmar, however, some public high schools continued to refuse access to student religious groups. Those schools took the view that prayer and Bible reading in public schools were constitutionally impermissible, even if wholly student initiated. At least one court of appeals has upheld that argument. Congress responded by passing the Equal Access Act of 1984. As a condition for receiving federal financial aid, the law required that public secondary schools not discriminate on the basis of religion or political viewpoint in recognizing and supporting extracurricular activities. This law has benefited a variety of student organizations, from gay and lesbian groups to evangelical Christian clubs. In 1985, a year after Congress passed the equal access law, school officials in Omaha, Nebraska, refused a student request for permission to form a Christian club at a public high school. The club\u2019s activities included reading and discussing the Bible and engaging in prayer. The students filed suit under the Equal Access Act, and the school officials responded that allowing such a club in a public school would violate the Establishment Clause. In the court case, Board of Education v. Mergens (1990), the Supreme Court upheld the Equal Access Act. The 8-1 majority reasoned that high schools were indistinguishable from universities for purposes of equal access to public facilities. Because there were many student groups devoted to different and frequently opposing causes, the court determined that no reasonable observer would see the school\u2019s recognition of a religious group as an official endorsement of the group\u2019s religious views. The limits of Widmar and Mergens were later put to the test in Rosenberger v. University of Virginia (1995) and Good News Club v. Milford Central School District (2001). In Rosenberger, the Supreme Court held 5-4 that the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment required a state university to grant the same printing subsidy to an evangelical journal that it made available to all other student journals. The dissenters argued, unsuccessfully, that state financial support for a proselytizing journal violated the Establishment Clause. In Good News Club, a 6-3 majority held that the Free Speech Clause prohibited an elementary school from excluding an evangelical Christian program for children from the list of accepted after-school activities. These equal access decisions have led to new controversies in the lower courts. In Child Evangelism Fellowship of Maryland v. Montgomery County Public Schools (2006), for instance, a federal appellate court extended the equal access principle to fliers that schools distributed to students to take home for the purpose of informing parents about after-school activities. For years the county had distributed fliers for children\u2019s sports leagues and activities like the Boy Scouts. But it refused to distribute fliers for the after-school programs of the Child Evangelism Fellowship of Maryland, which are not held on school property. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that the county\u2019s flier distribution policy was unconstitutionally discriminatory. The presence of student religious groups in public schools has raised one additional issue. At times these groups insist that their officers make specific religious commitments, such as accepting Jesus Christ as savior and maintaining sexual abstinence outside of heterosexual marriage. As a result, some students are excluded from joining the group or from its leadership ranks. In Hsu v. Roslyn Union Free School District No. 3 (1996), the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that the federal Equal Access Act gave students in an evangelical Christian group the right to maintain religious criteria for office. The court said the school\u2019s policy against religious discrimination by student groups was unenforceable in this instance. The issue arrived at the Supreme Court in 2010 in a case involving a public law school\u2019s decision to deny official recognition to the Christian Legal Society (CLS), a nationwide, nondenominational organization of Christian lawyers, judges and law students. Although the case, Christian Legal Society v. Martinez, involved just one law school (the University of California, Hastings College of Law), other law schools around the country also had been sued by the organization for similar reasons. By the time the Supreme Court agreed to hear Martinez, lower federal courts in different cases had ruled both for and against the organization. The case centered on Hastings\u2019 policies toward student organizations. Student groups that are officially recognized by Hastings enjoy certain privileges, including access to school facilities and funding. But CLS membership requirements effectively bar non-Christians from becoming voting members and non-celibate gays and lesbians from assuming leadership positions, which conflicts with the law school\u2019s stated policy of requiring registered student groups to accept any students as members. After Hastings refused to exempt CLS from the policy \u2013 known as the \u201call-comers\u201d policy \u2013 the group sued, claiming the policy violated its First and 14th Amendment rights to free speech, expressive association and freedom of religious expression. A federal district court and the Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit sided with Hastings, and CLS appealed to the Supreme Court. The case was widely viewed as a contest between the right of free association and nondiscrimination policies. In its ruling, however, the court did not resolve any broad questions raised by this conflict. Instead, the 5-4 majority handed down a narrowly tailored decision that upheld the specific policy of Hastings Law School \u2013 the \u201call-comers\u201d policy \u2013 as long as it is applied in an evenhanded manner. Writing for the high court\u2019s majority, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that Hastings\u2019 policy requiring officially registered student groups to allow anyone to join does not unconstitutionally discriminate against groups with particular viewpoints or missions. Quite the contrary, she wrote, the policy is completely neutral since it requires all organizations to open their membership and leadership to all students. Ginsburg argued that it is CLS that wants an exemption from the policy and thus threatens its neutrality. Moreover, she wrote, an \u201call-comers\u201d policy is reasonable for an educational institution because it encourages all groups to accept and interact with students who hold diverse views. Finally, Ginsburg noted that even though the Christian Legal Society has been denied official recognition by the law school, the group can, and still does, freely operate on campus and is even allowed to use school facilities to hold meetings. Writing for the dissent, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. argued that by affirming Hastings\u2019 policy, the majority sacrificed core First Amendment principles in favor of political correctness and armed \u201cpublic educational institutions with a handy weapon for suppressing the speech of unpopular groups.\u201d In addition, Alito asserted, the majority overlooked certain evidence demonstrating that Hastings had singled out CLS because of its beliefs. Prior to the lawsuit, he said, many officially recognized groups on the Hastings campus \u2013 not just CLS \u2013 had membership requirements written into their bylaws that were discriminatory. Justice Alito also disputed the majority\u2019s contention that CLS, even without official recognition, can still effectively operate on campus, noting that the administration has ignored requests by the group to secure rooms for meetings and tables at campus events.

Will smart machines really replace human workers? Probably not. People and AI both bring different abilities and strengths to the table. The real question is: how can human intelligence work with artificial intelligence to produce augmented intelligence. Chess ...\nIn an economy where data is changing how companies create value \u2014 and compete \u2014 experts predict that using artificial intelligence (AI) at a larger scale will add as much as $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 . As AI is changing how companies work, many believe that who does this work will change, too \u2014 and that organizations will begin to replace human employees with intelligent machines . This is already happening: intelligent systems are displacing humans in manufacturing, service delivery, recruitment, and the financial industry, consequently moving human workers towards lower-paid jobs or making them unemployed. This trend has led some to conclude that in 2040 our workforce may be totally unrecognizable .\nAre humans and machine really in competition with each other though? The history of work \u2014 particularly since the Industrial Revolution \u2014 is the history of people outsourcing their labor to machines. While that began with rote, repetitive physical tasks like weaving, machines have evolved to the point where they can now do what we might think of as complex cognitive work, such as math equations, recognizing language and speech, and writing. Machines thus seem ready to replicate the work of our minds, and not just our bodies. In the 21st century, AI is evolving to be superior to humans in many tasks, which makes that we seem ready to outsource our intelligence to technology. With this latest trend, it seems like there\u2019s nothing that can\u2019t soon be automated, meaning that no job is safe from being offloaded to machines.\nThis vision of the future of work has taken the shape of a zero-sum game, in which there can only be one winner.\nWe believe, however, that this view of the role AI will play in the workplace is wrong. The question of whether AI will replace human workers assumes that AI and humans have the same qualities and abilities \u2014 but, in reality, they don\u2019t. AI-based machines are fast, more accurate, and consistently rational, but they aren\u2019t intuitive, emotional, or culturally sensitive. And, it\u2019s exactly these abilities that humans posses and which make us effective.\nIn general, people recognize today\u2019s advanced computers as intelligent because they have the potential to learn and make decisions based on the information they take in. But while we may recognize that ability, it\u2019s a decidedly different type of intelligence what we posses.\nIn its simplest form, AI is a computer acting and deciding in ways that seem intelligent. In line with Alan Turing\u2019s philosophy, AI imitates how humans act, feel, speak, and decide. This type of intelligence is extremely useful in an organizational setting: Because of its imitating abilities, AI has the quality to identify informational patterns that optimize trends relevant to the job. In addition, contrary to humans, AI never gets physically tired and as long it\u2019s fed data it will keep going.\nThese qualities mean that AI is perfectly suited to put at work in lower-level routine tasks that are repetitive and take place within a closed management system. In such a system, the rules of the game are clear and not influenced by external forces. Think, for example, of an assembly line where workers are not interrupted by external demands and influences like work meetings. As a case in point, the assembly line is exactly the place where Amazon placed algorithms in the role of managers to supervise human workers and even fire them . As the work is repetitive and subject to rigid procedures optimizing efficiency and productivity, AI is able to perform in more accurate ways to human supervisors.\nHuman abilities, however, are more expansive. Contrary to AI abilities that are only responsive to the data available, humans have the ability to imagine, anticipate, feel, and judge changing situations, which allows them to shift from short-term to long-term concerns. These abilities are unique to humans and do not require a steady flow of externally provided data to work as is the case with artificial intelligence.\nIn this way humans represent what we call authentic intelligence \u2014 a different type of AI, if you will. This type of intelligence is needed when open systems are in place. In an open management system, the team or organization is interacting with the external environment and therefore has to deal with influences from outside. Such work setting requires the ability to anticipate and work with, for example, sudden changes and distorted information exchange, while at the same time being creative in distilling a vision and future strategy. In open systems, transformation efforts are continuously at work and effective management of that process requires authentic intelligence.\nAlthough Artificial Intelligence (referred to as AI1 here) seems opposite to Authentic Intelligence (referred to as AI2 here), they are also complimentary. In the context of organizations, both types of intelligence offer a range of specific talents.\nWhich talents \u2013 operationalized as abilities needed to meet performance requirements \u2013 are needed to perform best? It is, first of all, important to emphasize that talent can win games, but often it will not win championships \u2014 teams win championships. For this reason, we believe that it will be the combination of the talents included in both AI1 and AI2, working in tandem, that will make for the future of intelligent work. It will create the kind of intelligence that will allow for organizations to be more efficient and accurate, but at the same time also creative and pro-active. This other type of AI we call Augmented Intelligence (referred to as AI3 here).\nWhat will AI3 be able to offer that AI1 and AI2 can\u2019t? The second author of this article has some unique insight here: he is known for winning championships, while at the same time he also has the distinctive experience of being the first human to lose a high-level game to a machine. In 1997, chess grand master Garry Kasparov lost a game from an IBM supercomputer program called Deep Blue. It left him to rethink how the intellectual game of chess could be approached differently, not simply as an individual effort but as a collaborative one. And, with the unexpected victory of Deep Blue, he decided to try collaborating with an AI.\nIn a match in 1998 in Le\u00f3n, Spain, Kasparov partnered with a PC running the chess software of his choice \u2014 an arrangement called \u201cadvanced chess\u201d \u2014 in a match against the Bulgarian Veselin Topalov, who he had beaten 4-0 a month earlier. This time, with both players supported by computers, the match ended in a 3-3 draw. It appeared that the use of a PC nullified the calculative and strategic advances Kasparov usually displayed over his opponent.\nThe match provided an important illustration of how humans might work with AI. After the match, Kasparov noted that the use of a PC allowed him to focus more on strategic planning while machine took care of the calculations. Nevertheless, he also stressed that simply putting together the best human player and best PC did not, in his eyes, reveal games that were perfect. Like with human teams, the power of working with an AI comes from how the person and computer compliment each other; the best players and most powerful AIs partnering up don\u2019t necessarily produce the best results.\nOnce again, the chess world offers a useful test case for how this collaboration can play out. In 2005 the online chess playing site Playchess.com hosted what it called a \u201cfreestyle\u201d chess tournament in which anyone could compete in teams with other players or computers. What made this competition interesting is that several groups of grandmasters working with computers also participated in this tournament. Predictably, most people expected that one of these grandmasters in combination with a supercomputer would dominate this competition \u2014 but that\u2019s not what happened. The tournament was won by a pair of amateur American chess players using three computers. It was their ability to coordinate and coach effectively their computers that defeated the combination of a smart grandmaster and a PC with great computational power.\nThis surprising result underscores an important lesson: the process of how players and computers interact determines how efficient the partnership will be. Or, as Kasparov expressed it, \u201cWeak human + machine + better process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more remarkably, superior to a strong human + machine + inferior process.\u201d\nThe enhancing and collaborative potential that we envision stands in stark contrast to the zero-sum predictions of what AI will do to our society and organizations. Instead, we believe that greater productivity and the automation of cognitively routine work is a boon, not a threat. After all, new technology always has disruptive effects early on in the implementation and development phases and usually reveals its real value only after some time.\nThis reality, however, does not mean that we have to wait patiently until when this value eventually reveals itself \u2014 very much the opposite! Our principal challenge as business people is to anticipate what artificial intelligence means in relationship to how humans think and act, and work to integrate the new technologies ambitiously and strategically into our organizations. We can\u2019t just passively wait for it to overtake traditional methods.

These occurrences, alongside rising temperatures and pollution, are evidence of a need for urgency in addressing climate change. As a result, most governments, including the United States, actively promote sustainable development by setting stringent targets. One of the most effective methods governments use to encourage sustainable development is offering incentives to individuals and businesses. In this post, we will explore key incentives used by the government to encourage businesses to embrace sustainable development: Skip to What You Need While initial investments in green energy may be costly, they can save your business thousands of dollars in the long run. Some economic benefits of embracing sustainable business practices include; lowering utility bills, making extra money by selling ERCs to high emitters, and enjoying tax benefits and grants from federal and state governments. Other benefits of being a more sustainable business include: Attracting climate change-conscious customers . Some customers prefer spending their money in an establishment that stands for what they believe in. Improve public health and cut pollution. If you care about your carbon footprint, embracing sustainability is the most effective way of ensuring you do just that. Also, it means a cleaner environment for you, your employees, and the community living near you. You become an example to other businesses . If climate change and sustainable development are a major concern to you, there is no better way of getting the message out there than walking the talk. If people can see your talk in action and its benefits, they will be more willing to embrace it, and you will have played your role in making the world a better place. Increase your business\u2019s ability to comply with changing regulations . Sustainable development regulation keeps changing over time. What was a standard ten years ago is not a standard today and may keep changing as need demands. Embracing the highest level of sustainable business practices mean that even when policies change, you will have an easier time complying. Transitioning from one model or running a business to another is not always as easy. So if you are starting a business, start as sustainably as possible to avoid the challenges of making it sustainable later. If you are unsure what to start, these free business resources can help you start and run a business. Take a look at this video by Science for Georgia to learn more about beneficial, sustainable business practices: Governments worldwide are racing to achieve sustainable development per the United Nations Development Policies.

[ 30 ] A study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that \u201clegal purchase of a handgun appears to be associated with a long-lasting increased risk of violent death\u201d [ 6 ] According to a Mar. 10, 2016 Lancet study, implementing federal universal background checks could reduce firearm deaths by a projected 56.9%; background checks for ammunition purchases could reduce deaths by a projected 80.7%; and gun identification requirements could reduce deaths by a projected 82.5%. [ 148 ] Gun licensing laws were associated with a 14% decrease in firearm homicides, while increases in firearm homicides were seen in places with right-to-carry and stand-your ground-laws. [ 158 ] [ 160 ]\nPro 3\nHigh-capacity magazines should be banned because they too often turn murder into mass murder.\nA Mother Jones investigation found that high-capacity magazines were used in at least 50% of the 62 mass shootings between 1982 and 2012. [ 7 ] When high-capacity magazines were used in mass shootings, the death rate rose 63% and the injury rate rose 156%. [ 8 ] David H. Chipman, Senior Vice President of Public Safety for ShotSpotter and former Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) agent, stated that a high-capacity magazine \u201cturns a killer into a killing machine.\u201d [ 7 ] Some gang members use high-capacity magazines, such as 30 rounds or even 90 rounds, to compensate for lack of accuracy and maximize the chance to harm. [ 9 ] According to a Feb. 2019 NPR poll, 65% of Americans believed banning high-capacity magazines would reduce gun violence. [ 165 ]\nPro 4\nMore gun control laws are needed to protect women from domestic abusers and stalkers.\nFive women are murdered with guns every day in the United States. [ 10 ] A woman\u2019s risk of being murdered increases 500% if a gun is present during a domestic dispute. [ 11 ] During the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, 5,364 US soldiers were killed in action between Oct. 7, 2001 and Jan. 28, 2015; between 2001 and 2012 6,410 women were killed with a gun by an intimate partner in the United States. [ 10 ] [ 12 ] A 2003 study of 23 populous high-income countries found that 86% of women killed by firearms were in the United States and American women are 11.4 times more likely to be the victims of gun homicides [ 13 ] 57% of mass shootings involved domestic violence. [ 11 ] [ 14 ] For example, the 2011 mass shooting at a Seal Beach, CA hair salon reportedly began because of the shooter\u2019s custody battle with his ex-wife who was a hair stylist at the salon. [ 11 ] [ 8 ] 31 states do not ban convicted misdemeanor stalkers from owning guns and 41 states do not force convicted domestic abusers from relinquishing guns they already own. [ 10 ] [ 14 ] 76% of women murdered and 85% of women who survived a murder attempt by an intimate partner were stalked in the year before the murder or murder attempt. [ 15 ]\nPro 5\nGuns are rarely used in self-defense.\nOf the 29,618,300 violent crimes committed between 2007 and 2011, 0.79% of victims (235,700) protected themselves with a threat of use or use of a firearm, the least-employed protective behavior. [ 16 ] In 2010 there were 230 \u201cjustifiable homicides\u201d in which a private citizen used a firearm to kill a felon, compared to 8,275 criminal gun homicides (or, 36 criminal homicides for every \u201cjustifiable homicide\u201d). [ 17 ] Of the 84,495,500 property crimes committed between 2007 and 2011, 0.12% of victims (103,000) protected themselves with a threat of use or use of a firearm. [ 16 ]\nPro 6\nLegally owned guns are frequently stolen and used by criminals.\nA June 2013 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report states that \u201c[a]lmost all guns used in criminal acts enter circulation via initial legal transaction.\u201d [ 18 ] Between 2005 and 2010, 1.4 million guns were stolen from US homes during property crimes (including burglary and car theft), a yearly average of 232,400. [ 19 ] Ian Ayres, JD, PhD, and John J. Donohue, JD, PhD, Professors of Law at Yale Law School and Stanford Law School respectively, state, \u201cwith guns being a product that can be easily carried away and quickly sold at a relatively high fraction of the initial cost, the presence of more guns can actually serve as a stimulus to burglary and theft. Even if the gun owner had a permit to carry a concealed weapon and would never use it in furtherance of a crime, is it likely that the same can be said for the burglar who steals the gun?\u201d [ 20 ]\nPro 7\nGun control laws would reduce the societal costs associated with gun violence.\nThe more than 100,000 people shot in the United States each year generate emergency room and hospital charges of nearly $3 billion. [ 163 ] A study in the American Journal of Public Health estimated that hospitalizations for firearm-related injuries cost Medicaid and Medicare $2.7 billion over nine years. [ 21 ] A study in the American Journal of Public Health estimated that hospitalizations for firearm-related injuries cost Medicaid and Medicare $2.7 billion over nine years. [ 22 ] 84% of those injured by firearms are uninsured, leaving taxpayers responsible for most of those bills through programs like Medicaid. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [26] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the costs of gun violence can include legal services, medical costs, perpetrator control, policing, incarceration, foster care, private security, lost earnings and time, life insurance, productivity, tourism, and psychological costs (pain and suffering), among others. [ 25 ] Homicide rates doubling has been associated with a 12.5% decline in property values. [ 25 ]\nPro 8\nA majority of adults, including gun owners, support common sense gun control such as background checks, bans on assault weapons, and bans on high-capacity magazines.\nAccording to a Feb. 20, 2018 Quinnipiac Poll, 97% of American voters and 97% of gun owners support universal background checks. 67% support a nationwide ban on assault weapons, and 83% support mandatory waiting periods for gun purchases. [ 155 ] As much as 40% of all gun sales are undocumented private party gun sales that do not require a background check (aka the \u201cgun show loophole\u201d). [ 28 ] 53% of all adults surveyed approve of high-capacity magazine bans. [ 27 ] 89% of adults with a gun in the home approve of laws to prevent the purchase of guns by the mentally ill, and 82% approve of banning gun sales to people on no-fly lists. [ 27 ] 77% of Americans support requiring a license to purchase a gun. [ 165 ] Don Macalady, member of Hunters against Gun Violence, stated, \u201cAs a hunter and someone who has owned guns since I was a young boy, I believe that commonsense gun legislation makes us all safer. Background checks prevent criminals and other dangerous people from getting guns.\u201d [ 29 ]\nPro 9\nMore gun control leads to fewer suicides.\nBetween 1999 and 2013 there were 270,237 firearm suicides in the United States, accounting for about 52% of all suicides during those years. [ 4 ] When US gun ownership goes down, overall suicide rates drop; meanwhile, each 10 percentage-point increase in gun ownership is linked to a 26.9% increase in the youth suicide rate. [ 31 ] [ 164 ] Female first-time firearm owners were 35 times more likely to commit suicide within 12 years of buying the gun compared to women who did not own guns; male first-time firearm owners were about eight times more likely to do so. [ 171 ] [ 172 ] Firearm-related suicides accounted for 61% of the gun deaths in the United States between 2000 and 2010. [ 18 ] Researchers found that a \u201cgeneral barrier to firearm access created through state regulation can have a significant deterrent effect on male suicide rates in the United States. Permit requirements and bans on sales to minors were the most effective of the regulations analyzed.\u201d [ 32 ] In Indiana and Connecticut, after \u201cred flag\u201d laws to remove guns from people who may pose a threat were enacted, gun suicides decreased by 7.5% and 13.7% respectively, while suicides by other means did not decrease during the same time. [ 158 ] [ 159 ] A person who wants to kill him/herself is unlikely to commit suicide with poison or a knife when a gun is unavailable. [ 33 ]\nPro 10\nEnacting gun control laws such as mandatory safety features would reduce the number of accidental gun deaths.\nApproximately 50% of unintentional fatal shootings were self-inflicted; and most unintentional firearm deaths were caused by friends or family members. [ 18 ] [ 4 ] According to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the National Physicians Alliance, states with the highest concentration of guns have nine times the amount of accidental gun deaths and \u201c89% of unintentional shooting deaths of children occur in the home\u2014and most of these deaths occur when children are playing with a loaded gun in their parents\u2019 absence.\u201d [ 34 ] The US General Accountability Office (GAO) estimated that 31% of total accidental shooting deaths could have been prevented by installing safety devices on guns: 100% of deaths per year in which a child under 6 years old shoots and kills him/herself or another child could be prevented by automatic child-proof safety locks; and 23% of accidental shooting deaths by adolescents and adults per year could be prevented by loading indicators showing when a bullet was in the chamber ready to be fired. [ 35 ] Marjorie Sanfilippo, PhD, Professor of Psychology at Eckerd College who has researched children\u2019s behavior around guns, stated, \u201cWe put gates around swimming pools to keep children from drowning. We put safety caps on medications to keep children from poisoning themselves\u2026 [B]ecause children are naturally curious and impulsive, and because we have shown time and again that we cannot \u2018gun-proof\u2019 them with education, we have a responsibility to keep guns out of the hands of children.\u201d [ 36 ]\nPro 11\nThe presence of a gun makes a conflict more likely to become violent.\nThe FBI found that in 2013 arguments (such as romantic triangles, brawls fueled by alcohol or drugs, and arguments over money) resulted in 1,962 gun deaths (59.9% of the total). [ 37 ] A June 1985 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that \u201cthe weapons used [in altercations]\u2026 were those closest at hand.\u201d [ 38 ] An editorial published in the June 1985 American Journal of Public Health noted, \u201cgun-inflicted deaths [often] ensue from impromptu arguments and fights; in the US, two-thirds of the 7,900 deaths in 1981 involving arguments and brawls were caused by guns.\u201d [ 39 ] A 1993 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that \u201c[r]ather than confer protection, guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance.\u201d [ 40 ]\nPro 12\nArmed civilians are unlikely to stop crimes and are more likely to make dangerous situations, including mass shootings, more deadly.\nNone of the 62 mass shootings between 1982 and 2012 was stopped by an armed civilian. [ 41 ] Gun rights activists regularly state that a 2002 mass shooting at the Appalachian School of Law in Virginia was stopped by armed students, but those students were current and former law enforcement officers and the killer was out of bullets when subdued. [ 41 ] Other mass shootings often held up as examples of armed citizens being able to stop mass shootings involved law enforcement or military personnel and/or the shooter had stopped shooting before being subdued, such as a 1997 high school shooting in Pearl, MS; a 1998 middle school dance shooting in Edinboro, PA; a 2007 church shooting in Colorado Springs, CO; and a 2008 bar shooting in Winnemucca, NV. [ 42 ] Jeffrey Voccola, Assistant Professor of Writing at Kutztown University, notes, \u201cThe average gun owner, no matter how responsible, is not trained in law enforcement or on how to handle life-threatening situations, so in most cases, if a threat occurs, increasing the number of guns only creates a more volatile and dangerous situation.\u201d [ 43 ]\nPro 13\nCountries with restrictive gun control laws have lower gun homicide and suicide rates than the United States.\nBoth Switzerland and Finland require gun owners to acquire licenses and pass background checks that include mental and criminal records, among other restrictions and requirements. [ 44 ] In 2007 Switzerland ranked number 3 in international gun ownership rates with 45.7 guns per 100 people (about 3,400,000 guns total). [ 45 ] In 2009 Switzerland had 24 gun homicides (0.31 deaths per 100,000 people) and 253 gun suicides (3.29 deaths per 100,000 people). [ 44 ] Finland ranked fourth in international gun ownership rates with 45.3 guns per 100 people (about 2,400,000 guns total). [ 45 ] In 2007 Finland had 23 (0.43 deaths per 100,000 people) gun homicides and 172 gun suicides (4.19 deaths per 100,000 people). [ 44 ] The United States, categorized as having \u201cpermissive\u201d firearm regulation by GunPolicy.org, ranked first in international gun ownership rates with 88.8 guns per 100 people (about 270,000,000 guns total). [ 44 ] [ 45 ] In 2007 the United States had 12,632 gun homicides (4.19 deaths per 100,000 people) and 17,352 gun suicides (5.76 deaths per 100,000 people). [ 44 ] [ 4 ] Harvard professor David Hemenway, PhD, wrote \u201cWe analyzed the relationship between homicide and gun availability using data from 26 developed countries from the early 1990s. We found that across developed countries, where guns are more available, there are more homicides.\u201d [ 46 ] According to a Mar. 2016 study, gun homicide rates in the United States were 25.3 times higher and gun suicides were 8 times higher in 2010 than in other populous, high-income countries. Additionally, 90% of women, 91% of 0- to 14-year olds, 92% of 15- to 24-year-olds, and 82% of all people killed by firearms were from the United States. [ 147 ]\nPro 14\nThe Second Amendment was intended to protect the right of militias to own guns, not the right of individuals.\nFormer Justice John Paul Stevens, JD, in his dissenting opinion for District of Columbia et al. v. Heller , wrote, \u201cthe Framer\u2019s single-minded focus in crafting the constitutional guarantee \u2018to keep and bear arms\u2019 was on military use of firearms, which they viewed in the context of service in state militias,\u201d hence the inclusion of the phrase \u201cwell regulated militia.\u201d [ 3 ] Michael Waldman, JD, President of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, stated there is nothing about an individual right to bear arms in the notes about the Second Amendment when it was being drafted, discussed, or ratified; the US Supreme Court declined to rule in favor of the individual right four times between 1876 and 1939; and all law articles on the Second Amendment from 1888 to 1959 stated that an individual right was not guaranteed. [ 47 ]\nPro 15\nCivilians, including hunters, should not own military-grade firearms or firearm accessories.\nPresident Ronald Reagan and others did not think the AR-15 military rifle (also called M16s by the Air Force) should be owned by civilians and, when the AR-15 was included in the assault weapons ban of 1994 (which expired on Sep. 13, 2004), the NRA supported the legislation. [ 48 ] The Second Amendment was written at a time when the most common arms were long rifles that had to be reloaded after every shot. Civilians today have access to folding, detaching, or telescoping stocks that make the guns more easily concealed and carried; silencers to muffle gunshot sounds; flash suppressors to fire in low-light conditions without being blinded by the flash and to conceal the shooter\u2019s location; or grenade launcher attachments. [ 49 ] Jonathan Lowy, Director of Legal Action Project at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, stated, \u201cThese are weapons that will shred your venison before you eat it, or go through the walls of your apartment when you\u2019re trying to defend yourself\u2026 [they are] made for mass killing, but not useful for law-abiding citizens.\u201d [ 50 ]\nCon 1\nThe Second Amendment of the US Constitution protects individual gun ownership.\nThe Second Amendment of the US Constitution reads, \u201cA well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d Gun ownership is an American tradition older than the country itself and is protected by the Second Amendment; more gun control laws would infringe upon the right to bear arms. Justice Antonin Scalia, LLB, in the June 26, 2008 District of Columbia et al. v. Heller US Supreme Court majority opinion syllabus stated, \u201cThe Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.\u201d [ 3 ] The McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010) ruling also stated that the Second Amendment is an individual right. [ 51 ] Lawrence Hunter, Chairman of Revolution PAC, stated, \u201cThe Founders understood that the right to own and bear laws is as fundamental and as essential to maintaining liberty as are the rights of free speech, a free press, freedom of religion and the other protections against government encroachments on liberty delineated in the Bill of Rights.\u201d [ 52 ]\nCon 2\nGun control laws do not deter crime; gun ownership deters crime.\nA study in Applied Economics Letters found that \u201cassault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level\u201d and \u201cstates with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders.\u201d [ 103 ] While gun ownership doubled in the twentieth century, the murder rate decreased. [ 53 ] John R. Lott, Jr., PhD, author of More Guns, Less Crime: Understanding Crime and Gun Control Laws , stated, \u201cStates with the largest increases in gun ownership also have the largest drops in violent crimes\u2026 The effect on \u2018shall-issue\u2019 [concealed gun] laws on these crimes [where two or more people were killed] has been dramatic. When states passed these laws, the number of multiple-victim shootings declined by 84 percent. Deaths from these shootings plummeted on average by 90 percent and injuries by 82 percent.\u201d [ 54 ] More than two-thirds of gun owners cite protection as a major reason for owning a gun. [ 55 ] Journalist John Stossel explained, \u201cCriminals don\u2019t obey the law\u2026 Without the fear of retaliation from victims who might be packing heat, criminals in possession of these [illegal] weapons now have a much easier job\u2026 As the saying goes, \u2018If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.'\u201d [ 56 ]\nCon 3\nGun control laws infringe upon the right to self-defense and deny people a sense of safety.\nAccording to the National Rifle Association (NRA), guns are used for self-defense 2.5 million times a year. [ 57 ] The police cannot protect everyone all of the time. 61% of men and 56% of women surveyed by Pew Research said that stricter gun laws would \u201cmake it more difficult for people to protect their homes and families.\u201d [ 58 ] Nelson Lund, JD, PhD, Professor at George Mason University School of Law, stated, \u201cThe right to self-defense and to the means of defending oneself is a basic natural right that grows out of the right to life\u201d and \u201cmany [gun control laws] interfere with the ability of law-abiding citizens to defend themselves against violent criminals.\u201d [ 59 ] Constitutions in 37 US states protect the right to bear arms for self-defense, most with explicit language such as Alabama\u2019s: \u201cevery citizen has a right to bear arms in defense of himself and the state.\u201d [ 60 ] [ 61 ] Wayne LaPierre, Executive Vice President of the NRA, stated, \u201cThe only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\u201d [ 62 ] A May 9, 2013 48% of convicted felons surveyed admitted that they avoided committing crimes when they knew the victim was armed with a gun. [ 63 ] Pew Foundation report found that 79% of male gun owners and 80% of female gun owners said owning a gun made them feel safer and 64% of people living in a home in which someone else owns a gun felt safer. [ 58 ] Even Senator Dianne Feinstein, a gun control advocate, carried a concealed gun when her life was threatened and her home attacked by the New World Liberation Front in the 1970s. [ 64 ]\nCon 4\nGun control laws, especially those that try to ban \u201cassault weapons,\u201d infringe upon the right to own guns for hunting and sport.\nIn 2011, there were 13.7 million hunters 16 years old or older in the United States, and they spent $7.7 billion on guns, sights, ammunition, and other hunting equipment. [ 65 ] [ 66 ] High-powered semiautomatic rifles and shotguns are used to hunt and in target shooting tournaments each year. [ 67 ] According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, \u201cSo-called \u2018Assault weapons\u2019 are more often than not less powerful than other hunting rifles. The term \u2018assault weapon\u2019 was conjured up by anti-gun legislators to scare voters into thinking these firearms are something out of a horror movie\u2026 [T]he Colt AR-15 and Springfield M1A, both labeled \u2018assault weapons,\u2019 are the rifles most used for marksmanship competitions in the United States. And their cartridges are standard hunting calibers, useful for game up to and including deer.\u201d [ 68 ] According to a Feb. 2013 Pew Research report, 32% of gun owners owned guns for hunting and 7% owned guns for target or sport shooting. [ 58 ]\nCon 5\nGun control laws will not prevent criminals from obtaining guns or breaking laws.\nOf 62 mass shootings in the United States between 1982 and 2012, 49 of the shooters used legally obtained guns. Collectively, 143 guns were possessed by the killers with about 75% obtained legally. [ 69 ] A Secret Service analysis found that of 24 mass shootings in 2019 at least 10 (42%) involved illegally possessed guns. [ 176 ] John R. Lott, Jr., PhD, gun rights activist, stated, \u201cThe problem with such [gun control] laws is that they take away guns from law-abiding citizens, while would-be criminals ignore them.\u201d [ 70 ] According to a Bureau of Justice Statistics May 2013 report, 37.4% of state prison inmates who \u201cused, carried, or possessed a firearm when they committed the crime for which they were serving a prison sentence\u201d obtained the gun from a family member or friend. [ 16 ] Despite Chicago\u2019s ban on gun shops, shooting ranges, assault weapons, and high capacity magazines, in 2014 Chicago had 2,089 shooting victims including at least 390 murders. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] Approximately 50,000 guns were recovered by police in Chicago between 2001 and Mar. 2012. The guns came from all 50 states, and more than half came from outside of Illinois. [ 74 ]\nCon 6\nGun control laws give too much power to the government and may result in government tyranny and the government taking away all guns from citizens.\n57% of people surveyed by Pew Research in Feb. 2013 said that gun control laws would \u201cgive too much power to the government over the people.\u201d [ 58 ] The NRA\u2019s Wayne LaPierre stated, \u201cif you look at why our Founding Fathers put it [the Second Amendment] there, they had lived under the tyranny of King George and they wanted to make sure that these free people in this new country would never be subjugated again and have to live under tyranny.\u201d [ 75 ] Alex Jones, radio host, in a Jan 7, 2013 interview with Piers Morgan, stated, \u201cThe Second Amendment isn\u2019t there for duck hunting, it\u2019s there to protect us from tyrannical government and street thugs\u2026 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!\u201d [ 76 ]\nCon 7\nGun control laws such as background checks and micro-stamping are an invasion of privacy.\nBackground checks would require government databases that keep personal individual information on gun owners, including name, addresses, mental health history, criminal records, and more. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) worried that Senator Harry Reid\u2019s 2013 proposed background check legislation (the bill failed 54-46) would have allowed the government to keep databases of gun purchases indefinitely, creating a \u201cworry that you\u2019re going to see searches of the databases and an expansion for purposes that were not intended when the information was collected.\u201d [ 77 ] [ 78 ] Micro-stamping similarly requires a database of gun owners and the codes their personal guns would stamp on cartridge cases. [ 79 ] Senators Rand Paul (R-KY), Mike Lee (R-UT), and Ted Cruz (R-TX) wrote that they would oppose any legislation that infringes \u201con the American people\u2019s constitutional right to bear arms, or on their ability to exercise this right without being subjected to government surveillance.\u201d [ 80 ]\nCon 8\nMore gun control is unnecessary because relatively few people are killed by guns.\nAccording to the CDC\u2019s \u201cLeading Causes of Death Reports,\u201d between 1999 and 2013, Americans were 21.5 times more likely to die of heart disease (9,691,733 deaths); 18.7 times more likely to die of malignant tumors (8,458,868 deaths); and 2.4 times more likely to die of diabetes or 2.3 times more likely to die of Alzheimer\u2019s (1,080,298 and 1,053,207 respectively) than to die from a firearm (whether by accident, homicide, or suicide). [ 4 ] The flu and related pneumonia (875,143 deaths); traffic accidents (594,280 deaths); and poisoning whether via accident, homicide, or suicide (475,907 deaths) all killed more people between 1999 and 2013 than firearms. [ 4 ] Firearms were the 12th leading cause of deaths for all deaths between 1999 and 2013, responsible for 1.3% of deaths with 464,033 deaths. [ 4 ] Internationally, the claim that the United States has a major problem with firearm homicide is exaggerated. The United States is ranked 28 in international homicide rates with 2.97 gun murders per 100,000 people in 2012. [ 89 ]\nCon 9\nGun control laws and lower gun ownership rates do not prevent suicides.\nLithuania has one of the world\u2019s lowest gun ownership rates (0.7 guns per 100 people) but its suicide rate (by any method) was 45.06 per 100,000 people in 1999, the highest suicide rate among 71 countries with available information. [ 44 ] Japan has a low gun ownership rate at 0.6 guns per 100 people and a high suicide rate of 18.41 suicides per 100,000 people in 1997 (ranking it 11 out of 71 countries). [ 44 ] [ 45 ] South Korea has a low gun ownership rate (1.1 guns per 100 people) but has a high rate of suicide and the highest rate of gun suicides (12.63 per 100,000 people in 1997). [ 44 ] [ 45 ] By contrast the United States has the 26th highest suicide rate (12.3 suicides per 100,000 people in 2011) and the highest gun ownership rate (88.8 guns per 100 people). [ 44 ] [ 45 ] Jim Barrett, author for TheTruthAboutGuns.com, stated, \u201cthe theory that the restriction or elimination of guns would have a positive effect on the overall suicide rate in the U.S. does not hold up under scrutiny.\u201d [ 81 ]\nCon 10\nMore gun control is not needed; education about guns and gun safety is needed to prevent accidental gun deaths.\n95% of all US gun owners believe that children should learn about gun safety. [ 154 ] Guns don\u2019t kill people; people kill people. And people need more gun education and mental illness screening to prevent massacres.The Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers\u2019 Institute, Inc (SAAMI), stated, \u201cWhether in the field, at the range or in the home, a responsible and knowledgeable gun owner is rarely involved in a firearms accident of any kind.\u201d [ 82 ] Heidi Cifelli, Former Program Manager of the NRA\u2019s Eddie Eagle GunSafe Program, stated, \u201cGun education is the best way to save young lives.\u201d [ 83 ] The NRA states that the Eddie Eagle program is not meant to \u201cteach whether guns are good or bad, but rather to promote the protection and safety of children\u2026 Like swimming pools, electrical outlets, matchbooks, and household poison, they\u2019re [guns] treated simply as a fact of everyday life.\u201d [ 84 ] According to Kyle Wintersteen, Managing Editor of Guns and Ammo , studies show that \u201cchildren taught about firearms and their legitimate uses by family members have much lower rates of delinquency than children in households without guns\u201d and \u201cchildren introduced to guns associate them with freedom, security, and recreation\u2014not violence.\u201d [ 85 ]\nCon 11\nGun control laws would prevent citizens from protecting themselves from foreign invaders.\nThe Libertarian Party stated, \u201cA responsible, well-armed and trained citizenry is the best protection against domestic crime and the threat of foreign invasion.\u201d [ 86 ] Counsel for the NRA stated, \u201cIt is evident that the framers of the Constitution did not intend to limit the right to keep and bear arms to a formal military body or organized militia, but intended to provide for an \u2018unorganized\u2019 armed citizenry prepared to assist in the common defense against a foreign invader or a domestic tyrant.\u201d [ 87 ] Marco Rubio (R-FL), US Senator, speaking about gun control laws during his 2016 presidential campaign, stated, \u201cIf God forbid, ISIS visits our life, our neighborhood, our school, any part of us, the last thing standing, the last line of defense could very well be our ability to protect ourselves.\u201d [ 149 ]\nCon 12\nStrict gun control laws do not work in Mexico, and will not work in the United States.\nMexico has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world and yet, in 2012, Mexico had 11,309 gun murders (9.97 gun homicides per 100,000 people) compared to the United States that had 9,146 gun homicides (2.97 per 100,000 people). [ 88 ] [ 89 ] . The country has only one legal gun store (the Directorate of Arms and Munitions Sales), compared to at least 63,709 legal gun stores and pawn shops in the United States as of Feb. 10, 2014. [ 90 ] [ 91 ] Mexico\u2019s gun store is on a secure military base and customers must present a valid ID, go through a metal detector, and turn over cellphones and cameras to guards. To actually buy a gun, customers have to show proof of honest income, provide references, pass a criminal background check, prove any military duties were completed with honor, and be fingerprinted and photographed. If allowed to purchase a gun, the customer may buy only one gun (choosing from only .38 caliber pistols or lower) and one box of bullets. [ 90 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] Between 2006 and 2010, Mexico\u2019s one gun shop sold 6,490 guns, [ 92 ] yet as of 2012, Mexicans own about 15,000,000 guns, or about 13.5 guns per 100 people. [ 44 ]\nCon 13\nGun control laws are racist.\nCurrent gun control laws are frequently aimed at inner city, poor, black communities who are perceived as more dangerous than white gun owners. [ 94 ] [ 95 ] Charles Gallagher, MA, PhD, the Chair of Sociology at LaSalle University, stated that some gun control laws are still founded on racial fears: \u201cWhites walking down Main Street with an AK-47 are defenders of American values; a black man doing the same thing is Public Enemy No. 1.\u201d [ 96 ] In the late 1960s, gun control laws were enacted in reaction to the militant, gun-carrying Black Panthers. [ 97 ] Adam Winkler, MA, JD, UCLA Constitutional Law Professor, stated \u201cThe KKK began as a gun-control organization. Before the Civil War, blacks were never allowed to own guns\u201d so, after the Civil War, there was \u201cconstant pressure among white racists to keep guns out of the hands of African Americans because they would rise up and revolt.\u201d [ 97 ] In Virginia, in response to Nat Turner\u2019s Rebellion (also called the Southampton Rebellion, in which slaves killed 55 to 65 people in the most fatal slave uprising in the United States) in 1831, a law was passed that prohibited free black people \u201cto keep or carry any firelock of any kind, any military weapon, or any powder or lead and all laws allowing free black people to possess firearms were repealed. [ 98 ] .\nCon 14\nThe Second Amendment was intended to protect gun ownership of all able-bodied men so that they could participate in the militia to keep the peace and defend the country if needed.\nAccording to the United States Code, a \u201cmilitia\u201d is composed of all \u201cable-bodied males at least 17 years of age\u2026 under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard.\u201d [ 99 ] Therefore, the militia mentioned in the Second Amendment would have been composed of almost all adult men and, in turn, that most adult men should not have their right to own firearms infringed. [ 100 ] A 1792 federal law required that every man eligible for militia service own a gun and ammunition suitable for military service, report for frequent inspection of their guns, and register their gun ownership on public records. [ 101 ] Daniel J. Schultz, lawyer, stated, \u201cthe Framers [of the Constitution and Bill of Rights] understood that \u2018well-regulated\u2019 militias, that is, armed citizens, ready to form militias that would be well trained, self-regulated and disciplined would post no threat to their fellow citizens, but would, indeed, help to \u2018insure domestic Tranquility\u2019 and \u2018provide for the common defence.'\u201d [ 100 ]\nCon 15\nGun control efforts have proved ineffective.\nAccording to David Lampo, Publications Director of the Cato Institute, \u201cthere is no correlation between waiting periods and murder or robbery rates.\u201d [ 102 ] Banning high-capacity magazines will not necessarily deter crime because even small gun magazines can be changed in seconds.The \u201cgun show loophole\u201d is virtually nonexistent because commercial dealers, who sell the majority of guns at shows and elsewhere, are bound by strict federal laws. [ 102 ] According to a Mar. 10, 2016 Lancet study, most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates, and, of 25 state laws, nine were associated with higher gun death rates. [ 148 ]", "source_raw_text": "The United States has 120.5 guns per 100 people, or about 393,347,000 guns, which is the highest total and per capita number in the world. 22% of Americans own one or more guns (35% of men and 12% of women). America\u2019s pervasive gun culture stems in part from its colonial history , revolutionary roots, frontier expansion, and the Second Amendment, which states: \u201cA well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d Proponents of more gun control laws state that the Second Amendment was intended for militias; that gun violence would be reduced; that gun restrictions have always existed; and that a majority of Americans, including gun owners, support new gun restrictions. Opponents say that the Second Amendment protects an individual\u2019s right to own guns; that guns are needed for self-defense from threats ranging from local criminals to foreign invaders; and that gun ownership deters crime rather than causes more crime. Read more background\u2026 Pro 1 The Second Amendment is not an unlimited right to own guns. In the June 26, 2008 District of Columbia et al. v. Heller US Supreme Court majority opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia, LLB, wrote, \u201cLike most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited\u2026 nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\u201d [ 3 ] On June 9, 2016 the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 7-4 that \u201c[t]he right of the general public to carry a concealed firearm in public is not, and never has been, protected by the Second Amendment,\u201d thus upholding a law requiring a permitting process and \u201cgood cause\u201d for concealed carry licenses in California. [ 145 ] [ 146 ] A 2018 study found that 91% of the 1,153 court cases with claims stating a government action or law violates the Second Amendment between the 2008 DC v. Heller decision and Feb. 1, 2016 failed. [ 157 ] Pro 2 More gun control laws would reduce gun deaths. There were 572,537 total gun deaths between 1999 and 2016: 336,579 suicides (58.8% of total gun deaths); 213,175 homicides (37.2%); and 11,428 unintentional deaths (2.0%). [ 162] Guns were the leading cause of death by homicide (67.7% of all homicides) and by suicide (51.8% of all suicides). [ 162 ] A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that firearms were the second leading cause of deaths for children, responsible for 15% of child deaths compared to 20% in motor vehicle crashes. [ 30 ] A study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that \u201clegal purchase of a handgun appears to be associated with a long-lasting increased risk of violent death\u201d [ 6 ] According to a Mar. 10, 2016 Lancet study, implementing federal universal background checks could reduce firearm deaths by a projected 56.9%; background checks for ammunition purchases could reduce deaths by a projected 80.7%; and gun identification requirements could reduce deaths by a projected 82.5%. [ 148 ] Gun licensing laws were associated with a 14% decrease in firearm homicides, while increases in firearm homicides were seen in places with right-to-carry and stand-your ground-laws. [ 158 ] [ 160 ] Pro 3 High-capacity magazines should be banned because they too often turn murder into mass murder. A Mother Jones investigation found that high-capacity magazines were used in at least 50% of the 62 mass shootings between 1982 and 2012. [ 7 ] When high-capacity magazines were used in mass shootings, the death rate rose 63% and the injury rate rose 156%. [ 8 ] David H. Chipman, Senior Vice President of Public Safety for ShotSpotter and former Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) agent, stated that a high-capacity magazine \u201cturns a killer into a killing machine.\u201d [ 7 ] Some gang members use high-capacity magazines, such as 30 rounds or even 90 rounds, to compensate for lack of accuracy and maximize the chance to harm. [ 9 ] According to a Feb. 2019 NPR poll, 65% of Americans believed banning high-capacity magazines would reduce gun violence. [ 165 ] Pro 4 More gun control laws are needed to protect women from domestic abusers and stalkers. Five women are murdered with guns every day in the United States. [ 10 ] A woman\u2019s risk of being murdered increases 500% if a gun is present during a domestic dispute. [ 11 ] During the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, 5,364 US soldiers were killed in action between Oct. 7, 2001 and Jan. 28, 2015; between 2001 and 2012 6,410 women were killed with a gun by an intimate partner in the United States. [ 10 ] [ 12 ] A 2003 study of 23 populous high-income countries found that 86% of women killed by firearms were in the United States and American women are 11.4 times more likely to be the victims of gun homicides [ 13 ] 57% of mass shootings involved domestic violence. [ 11 ] [ 14 ] For example, the 2011 mass shooting at a Seal Beach, CA hair salon reportedly began because of the shooter\u2019s custody battle with his ex-wife who was a hair stylist at the salon. [ 11 ] [ 8 ] 31 states do not ban convicted misdemeanor stalkers from owning guns and 41 states do not force convicted domestic abusers from relinquishing guns they already own. [ 10 ] [ 14 ] 76% of women murdered and 85% of women who survived a murder attempt by an intimate partner were stalked in the year before the murder or murder attempt. [ 15 ] Pro 5 Guns are rarely used in self-defense. Of the 29,618,300 violent crimes committed between 2007 and 2011, 0.79% of victims (235,700) protected themselves with a threat of use or use of a firearm, the least-employed protective behavior. [ 16 ] In 2010 there were 230 \u201cjustifiable homicides\u201d in which a private citizen used a firearm to kill a felon, compared to 8,275 criminal gun homicides (or, 36 criminal homicides for every \u201cjustifiable homicide\u201d). [ 17 ] Of the 84,495,500 property crimes committed between 2007 and 2011, 0.12% of victims (103,000) protected themselves with a threat of use or use of a firearm. [ 16 ] Pro 6 Legally owned guns are frequently stolen and used by criminals. A June 2013 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report states that \u201c[a]lmost all guns used in criminal acts enter circulation via initial legal transaction.\u201d [ 18 ] Between 2005 and 2010, 1.4 million guns were stolen from US homes during property crimes (including burglary and car theft), a yearly average of 232,400. [ 19 ] Ian Ayres, JD, PhD, and John J. Donohue, JD, PhD, Professors of Law at Yale Law School and Stanford Law School respectively, state, \u201cwith guns being a product that can be easily carried away and quickly sold at a relatively high fraction of the initial cost, the presence of more guns can actually serve as a stimulus to burglary and theft. Even if the gun owner had a permit to carry a concealed weapon and would never use it in furtherance of a crime, is it likely that the same can be said for the burglar who steals the gun?\u201d [ 20 ] Pro 7 Gun control laws would reduce the societal costs associated with gun violence. The more than 100,000 people shot in the United States each year generate emergency room and hospital charges of nearly $3 billion. [ 163 ] A study in the American Journal of Public Health estimated that hospitalizations for firearm-related injuries cost Medicaid and Medicare $2.7 billion over nine years. [ 21 ] A study in the American Journal of Public Health estimated that hospitalizations for firearm-related injuries cost Medicaid and Medicare $2.7 billion over nine years. [ 22 ] 84% of those injured by firearms are uninsured, leaving taxpayers responsible for most of those bills through programs like Medicaid. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [26] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the costs of gun violence can include legal services, medical costs, perpetrator control, policing, incarceration, foster care, private security, lost earnings and time, life insurance, productivity, tourism, and psychological costs (pain and suffering), among others. [ 25 ] Homicide rates doubling has been associated with a 12.5% decline in property values. [ 25 ] Pro 8 A majority of adults, including gun owners, support common sense gun control such as background checks, bans on assault weapons, and bans on high-capacity magazines. According to a Feb. 20, 2018 Quinnipiac Poll, 97% of American voters and 97% of gun owners support universal background checks. 67% support a nationwide ban on assault weapons, and 83% support mandatory waiting periods for gun purchases. [ 155 ] As much as 40% of all gun sales are undocumented private party gun sales that do not require a background check (aka the \u201cgun show loophole\u201d). [ 28 ] 53% of all adults surveyed approve of high-capacity magazine bans. [ 27 ] 89% of adults with a gun in the home approve of laws to prevent the purchase of guns by the mentally ill, and 82% approve of banning gun sales to people on no-fly lists. [ 27 ] 77% of Americans support requiring a license to purchase a gun. [ 165 ] Don Macalady, member of Hunters against Gun Violence, stated, \u201cAs a hunter and someone who has owned guns since I was a young boy, I believe that commonsense gun legislation makes us all safer. Background checks prevent criminals and other dangerous people from getting guns.\u201d [ 29 ] Pro 9 More gun control leads to fewer suicides. Between 1999 and 2013 there were 270,237 firearm suicides in the United States, accounting for about 52% of all suicides during those years. [ 4 ] When US gun ownership goes down, overall suicide rates drop; meanwhile, each 10 percentage-point increase in gun ownership is linked to a 26.9% increase in the youth suicide rate. [ 31 ] [ 164 ] Female first-time firearm owners were 35 times more likely to commit suicide within 12 years of buying the gun compared to women who did not own guns; male first-time firearm owners were about eight times more likely to do so. [ 171 ] [ 172 ] Firearm-related suicides accounted for 61% of the gun deaths in the United States between 2000 and 2010. [ 18 ] Researchers found that a \u201cgeneral barrier to firearm access created through state regulation can have a significant deterrent effect on male suicide rates in the United States. Permit requirements and bans on sales to minors were the most effective of the regulations analyzed.\u201d [ 32 ] In Indiana and Connecticut, after \u201cred flag\u201d laws to remove guns from people who may pose a threat were enacted, gun suicides decreased by 7.5% and 13.7% respectively, while suicides by other means did not decrease during the same time. [ 158 ] [ 159 ] A person who wants to kill him/herself is unlikely to commit suicide with poison or a knife when a gun is unavailable. [ 33 ] Pro 10 Enacting gun control laws such as mandatory safety features would reduce the number of accidental gun deaths. Approximately 50% of unintentional fatal shootings were self-inflicted; and most unintentional firearm deaths were caused by friends or family members. [ 18 ] [ 4 ] According to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the National Physicians Alliance, states with the highest concentration of guns have nine times the amount of accidental gun deaths and \u201c89% of unintentional shooting deaths of children occur in the home\u2014and most of these deaths occur when children are playing with a loaded gun in their parents\u2019 absence.\u201d [ 34 ] The US General Accountability Office (GAO) estimated that 31% of total accidental shooting deaths could have been prevented by installing safety devices on guns: 100% of deaths per year in which a child under 6 years old shoots and kills him/herself or another child could be prevented by automatic child-proof safety locks; and 23% of accidental shooting deaths by adolescents and adults per year could be prevented by loading indicators showing when a bullet was in the chamber ready to be fired. [ 35 ] Marjorie Sanfilippo, PhD, Professor of Psychology at Eckerd College who has researched children\u2019s behavior around guns, stated, \u201cWe put gates around swimming pools to keep children from drowning. We put safety caps on medications to keep children from poisoning themselves\u2026 [B]ecause children are naturally curious and impulsive, and because we have shown time and again that we cannot \u2018gun-proof\u2019 them with education, we have a responsibility to keep guns out of the hands of children.\u201d [ 36 ] Pro 11 The presence of a gun makes a conflict more likely to become violent. The FBI found that in 2013 arguments (such as romantic triangles, brawls fueled by alcohol or drugs, and arguments over money) resulted in 1,962 gun deaths (59.9% of the total). [ 37 ] A June 1985 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that \u201cthe weapons used [in altercations]\u2026 were those closest at hand.\u201d [ 38 ] An editorial published in the June 1985 American Journal of Public Health noted, \u201cgun-inflicted deaths [often] ensue from impromptu arguments and fights; in the US, two-thirds of the 7,900 deaths in 1981 involving arguments and brawls were caused by guns.\u201d [ 39 ] A 1993 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that \u201c[r]ather than confer protection, guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance.\u201d [ 40 ] Pro 12 Armed civilians are unlikely to stop crimes and are more likely to make dangerous situations, including mass shootings, more deadly. None of the 62 mass shootings between 1982 and 2012 was stopped by an armed civilian. [ 41 ] Gun rights activists regularly state that a 2002 mass shooting at the Appalachian School of Law in Virginia was stopped by armed students, but those students were current and former law enforcement officers and the killer was out of bullets when subdued. [ 41 ] Other mass shootings often held up as examples of armed citizens being able to stop mass shootings involved law enforcement or military personnel and/or the shooter had stopped shooting before being subdued, such as a 1997 high school shooting in Pearl, MS; a 1998 middle school dance shooting in Edinboro, PA; a 2007 church shooting in Colorado Springs, CO; and a 2008 bar shooting in Winnemucca, NV. [ 42 ] Jeffrey Voccola, Assistant Professor of Writing at Kutztown University, notes, \u201cThe average gun owner, no matter how responsible, is not trained in law enforcement or on how to handle life-threatening situations, so in most cases, if a threat occurs, increasing the number of guns only creates a more volatile and dangerous situation.\u201d [ 43 ] Pro 13 Countries with restrictive gun control laws have lower gun homicide and suicide rates than the United States. Both Switzerland and Finland require gun owners to acquire licenses and pass background checks that include mental and criminal records, among other restrictions and requirements. [ 44 ] In 2007 Switzerland ranked number 3 in international gun ownership rates with 45.7 guns per 100 people (about 3,400,000 guns total). [ 45 ] In 2009 Switzerland had 24 gun homicides (0.31 deaths per 100,000 people) and 253 gun suicides (3.29 deaths per 100,000 people). [ 44 ] Finland ranked fourth in international gun ownership rates with 45.3 guns per 100 people (about 2,400,000 guns total). [ 45 ] In 2007 Finland had 23 (0.43 deaths per 100,000 people) gun homicides and 172 gun suicides (4.19 deaths per 100,000 people). [ 44 ] The United States, categorized as having \u201cpermissive\u201d firearm regulation by GunPolicy.org, ranked first in international gun ownership rates with 88.8 guns per 100 people (about 270,000,000 guns total). [ 44 ] [ 45 ] In 2007 the United States had 12,632 gun homicides (4.19 deaths per 100,000 people) and 17,352 gun suicides (5.76 deaths per 100,000 people). [ 44 ] [ 4 ] Harvard professor David Hemenway, PhD, wrote \u201cWe analyzed the relationship between homicide and gun availability using data from 26 developed countries from the early 1990s. We found that across developed countries, where guns are more available, there are more homicides.\u201d [ 46 ] According to a Mar. 2016 study, gun homicide rates in the United States were 25.3 times higher and gun suicides were 8 times higher in 2010 than in other populous, high-income countries. Additionally, 90% of women, 91% of 0- to 14-year olds, 92% of 15- to 24-year-olds, and 82% of all people killed by firearms were from the United States. [ 147 ] Pro 14 The Second Amendment was intended to protect the right of militias to own guns, not the right of individuals. Former Justice John Paul Stevens, JD, in his dissenting opinion for District of Columbia et al. v. Heller , wrote, \u201cthe Framer\u2019s single-minded focus in crafting the constitutional guarantee \u2018to keep and bear arms\u2019 was on military use of firearms, which they viewed in the context of service in state militias,\u201d hence the inclusion of the phrase \u201cwell regulated militia.\u201d [ 3 ] Michael Waldman, JD, President of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, stated there is nothing about an individual right to bear arms in the notes about the Second Amendment when it was being drafted, discussed, or ratified; the US Supreme Court declined to rule in favor of the individual right four times between 1876 and 1939; and all law articles on the Second Amendment from 1888 to 1959 stated that an individual right was not guaranteed. [ 47 ] Pro 15 Civilians, including hunters, should not own military-grade firearms or firearm accessories. President Ronald Reagan and others did not think the AR-15 military rifle (also called M16s by the Air Force) should be owned by civilians and, when the AR-15 was included in the assault weapons ban of 1994 (which expired on Sep. 13, 2004), the NRA supported the legislation. [ 48 ] The Second Amendment was written at a time when the most common arms were long rifles that had to be reloaded after every shot. Civilians today have access to folding, detaching, or telescoping stocks that make the guns more easily concealed and carried; silencers to muffle gunshot sounds; flash suppressors to fire in low-light conditions without being blinded by the flash and to conceal the shooter\u2019s location; or grenade launcher attachments. [ 49 ] Jonathan Lowy, Director of Legal Action Project at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, stated, \u201cThese are weapons that will shred your venison before you eat it, or go through the walls of your apartment when you\u2019re trying to defend yourself\u2026 [they are] made for mass killing, but not useful for law-abiding citizens.\u201d [ 50 ] Con 1 The Second Amendment of the US Constitution protects individual gun ownership. The Second Amendment of the US Constitution reads, \u201cA well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d Gun ownership is an American tradition older than the country itself and is protected by the Second Amendment; more gun control laws would infringe upon the right to bear arms. Justice Antonin Scalia, LLB, in the June 26, 2008 District of Columbia et al. v. Heller US Supreme Court majority opinion syllabus stated, \u201cThe Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.\u201d [ 3 ] The McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010) ruling also stated that the Second Amendment is an individual right. [ 51 ] Lawrence Hunter, Chairman of Revolution PAC, stated, \u201cThe Founders understood that the right to own and bear laws is as fundamental and as essential to maintaining liberty as are the rights of free speech, a free press, freedom of religion and the other protections against government encroachments on liberty delineated in the Bill of Rights.\u201d [ 52 ] Con 2 Gun control laws do not deter crime; gun ownership deters crime. A study in Applied Economics Letters found that \u201cassault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level\u201d and \u201cstates with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders.\u201d [ 103 ] While gun ownership doubled in the twentieth century, the murder rate decreased. [ 53 ] John R. Lott, Jr., PhD, author of More Guns, Less Crime: Understanding Crime and Gun Control Laws , stated, \u201cStates with the largest increases in gun ownership also have the largest drops in violent crimes\u2026 The effect on \u2018shall-issue\u2019 [concealed gun] laws on these crimes [where two or more people were killed] has been dramatic. When states passed these laws, the number of multiple-victim shootings declined by 84 percent. Deaths from these shootings plummeted on average by 90 percent and injuries by 82 percent.\u201d [ 54 ] More than two-thirds of gun owners cite protection as a major reason for owning a gun. [ 55 ] Journalist John Stossel explained, \u201cCriminals don\u2019t obey the law\u2026 Without the fear of retaliation from victims who might be packing heat, criminals in possession of these [illegal] weapons now have a much easier job\u2026 As the saying goes, \u2018If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.'\u201d [ 56 ] Con 3 Gun control laws infringe upon the right to self-defense and deny people a sense of safety. According to the National Rifle Association (NRA), guns are used for self-defense 2.5 million times a year. [ 57 ] The police cannot protect everyone all of the time. 61% of men and 56% of women surveyed by Pew Research said that stricter gun laws would \u201cmake it more difficult for people to protect their homes and families.\u201d [ 58 ] Nelson Lund, JD, PhD, Professor at George Mason University School of Law, stated, \u201cThe right to self-defense and to the means of defending oneself is a basic natural right that grows out of the right to life\u201d and \u201cmany [gun control laws] interfere with the ability of law-abiding citizens to defend themselves against violent criminals.\u201d [ 59 ] Constitutions in 37 US states protect the right to bear arms for self-defense, most with explicit language such as Alabama\u2019s: \u201cevery citizen has a right to bear arms in defense of himself and the state.\u201d [ 60 ] [ 61 ] Wayne LaPierre, Executive Vice President of the NRA, stated, \u201cThe only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\u201d [ 62 ] A May 9, 2013 48% of convicted felons surveyed admitted that they avoided committing crimes when they knew the victim was armed with a gun. [ 63 ] Pew Foundation report found that 79% of male gun owners and 80% of female gun owners said owning a gun made them feel safer and 64% of people living in a home in which someone else owns a gun felt safer. [ 58 ] Even Senator Dianne Feinstein, a gun control advocate, carried a concealed gun when her life was threatened and her home attacked by the New World Liberation Front in the 1970s. [ 64 ] Con 4 Gun control laws, especially those that try to ban \u201cassault weapons,\u201d infringe upon the right to own guns for hunting and sport. In 2011, there were 13.7 million hunters 16 years old or older in the United States, and they spent $7.7 billion on guns, sights, ammunition, and other hunting equipment. [ 65 ] [ 66 ] High-powered semiautomatic rifles and shotguns are used to hunt and in target shooting tournaments each year. [ 67 ] According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, \u201cSo-called \u2018Assault weapons\u2019 are more often than not less powerful than other hunting rifles. The term \u2018assault weapon\u2019 was conjured up by anti-gun legislators to scare voters into thinking these firearms are something out of a horror movie\u2026 [T]he Colt AR-15 and Springfield M1A, both labeled \u2018assault weapons,\u2019 are the rifles most used for marksmanship competitions in the United States. And their cartridges are standard hunting calibers, useful for game up to and including deer.\u201d [ 68 ] According to a Feb. 2013 Pew Research report, 32% of gun owners owned guns for hunting and 7% owned guns for target or sport shooting. [ 58 ] Con 5 Gun control laws will not prevent criminals from obtaining guns or breaking laws. Of 62 mass shootings in the United States between 1982 and 2012, 49 of the shooters used legally obtained guns. Collectively, 143 guns were possessed by the killers with about 75% obtained legally. [ 69 ] A Secret Service analysis found that of 24 mass shootings in 2019 at least 10 (42%) involved illegally possessed guns. [ 176 ] John R. Lott, Jr., PhD, gun rights activist, stated, \u201cThe problem with such [gun control] laws is that they take away guns from law-abiding citizens, while would-be criminals ignore them.\u201d [ 70 ] According to a Bureau of Justice Statistics May 2013 report, 37.4% of state prison inmates who \u201cused, carried, or possessed a firearm when they committed the crime for which they were serving a prison sentence\u201d obtained the gun from a family member or friend. [ 16 ] Despite Chicago\u2019s ban on gun shops, shooting ranges, assault weapons, and high capacity magazines, in 2014 Chicago had 2,089 shooting victims including at least 390 murders. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] Approximately 50,000 guns were recovered by police in Chicago between 2001 and Mar. 2012. The guns came from all 50 states, and more than half came from outside of Illinois. [ 74 ] Con 6 Gun control laws give too much power to the government and may result in government tyranny and the government taking away all guns from citizens. 57% of people surveyed by Pew Research in Feb. 2013 said that gun control laws would \u201cgive too much power to the government over the people.\u201d [ 58 ] The NRA\u2019s Wayne LaPierre stated, \u201cif you look at why our Founding Fathers put it [the Second Amendment] there, they had lived under the tyranny of King George and they wanted to make sure that these free people in this new country would never be subjugated again and have to live under tyranny.\u201d [ 75 ] Alex Jones, radio host, in a Jan 7, 2013 interview with Piers Morgan, stated, \u201cThe Second Amendment isn\u2019t there for duck hunting, it\u2019s there to protect us from tyrannical government and street thugs\u2026 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!\u201d [ 76 ] Con 7 Gun control laws such as background checks and micro-stamping are an invasion of privacy. Background checks would require government databases that keep personal individual information on gun owners, including name, addresses, mental health history, criminal records, and more. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) worried that Senator Harry Reid\u2019s 2013 proposed background check legislation (the bill failed 54-46) would have allowed the government to keep databases of gun purchases indefinitely, creating a \u201cworry that you\u2019re going to see searches of the databases and an expansion for purposes that were not intended when the information was collected.\u201d [ 77 ] [ 78 ] Micro-stamping similarly requires a database of gun owners and the codes their personal guns would stamp on cartridge cases. [ 79 ] Senators Rand Paul (R-KY), Mike Lee (R-UT), and Ted Cruz (R-TX) wrote that they would oppose any legislation that infringes \u201con the American people\u2019s constitutional right to bear arms, or on their ability to exercise this right without being subjected to government surveillance.\u201d [ 80 ] Con 8 More gun control is unnecessary because relatively few people are killed by guns. According to the CDC\u2019s \u201cLeading Causes of Death Reports,\u201d between 1999 and 2013, Americans were 21.5 times more likely to die of heart disease (9,691,733 deaths); 18.7 times more likely to die of malignant tumors (8,458,868 deaths); and 2.4 times more likely to die of diabetes or 2.3 times more likely to die of Alzheimer\u2019s (1,080,298 and 1,053,207 respectively) than to die from a firearm (whether by accident, homicide, or suicide). [ 4 ] The flu and related pneumonia (875,143 deaths); traffic accidents (594,280 deaths); and poisoning whether via accident, homicide, or suicide (475,907 deaths) all killed more people between 1999 and 2013 than firearms. [ 4 ] Firearms were the 12th leading cause of deaths for all deaths between 1999 and 2013, responsible for 1.3% of deaths with 464,033 deaths. [ 4 ] Internationally, the claim that the United States has a major problem with firearm homicide is exaggerated. The United States is ranked 28 in international homicide rates with 2.97 gun murders per 100,000 people in 2012. [ 89 ] Con 9 Gun control laws and lower gun ownership rates do not prevent suicides. Lithuania has one of the world\u2019s lowest gun ownership rates (0.7 guns per 100 people) but its suicide rate (by any method) was 45.06 per 100,000 people in 1999, the highest suicide rate among 71 countries with available information. [ 44 ] Japan has a low gun ownership rate at 0.6 guns per 100 people and a high suicide rate of 18.41 suicides per 100,000 people in 1997 (ranking it 11 out of 71 countries). [ 44 ] [ 45 ] South Korea has a low gun ownership rate (1.1 guns per 100 people) but has a high rate of suicide and the highest rate of gun suicides (12.63 per 100,000 people in 1997). [ 44 ] [ 45 ] By contrast the United States has the 26th highest suicide rate (12.3 suicides per 100,000 people in 2011) and the highest gun ownership rate (88.8 guns per 100 people). [ 44 ] [ 45 ] Jim Barrett, author for TheTruthAboutGuns.com, stated, \u201cthe theory that the restriction or elimination of guns would have a positive effect on the overall suicide rate in the U.S. does not hold up under scrutiny.\u201d [ 81 ] Con 10 More gun control is not needed; education about guns and gun safety is needed to prevent accidental gun deaths. 95% of all US gun owners believe that children should learn about gun safety. [ 154 ] Guns don\u2019t kill people; people kill people. And people need more gun education and mental illness screening to prevent massacres.The Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers\u2019 Institute, Inc (SAAMI), stated, \u201cWhether in the field, at the range or in the home, a responsible and knowledgeable gun owner is rarely involved in a firearms accident of any kind.\u201d [ 82 ] Heidi Cifelli, Former Program Manager of the NRA\u2019s Eddie Eagle GunSafe Program, stated, \u201cGun education is the best way to save young lives.\u201d [ 83 ] The NRA states that the Eddie Eagle program is not meant to \u201cteach whether guns are good or bad, but rather to promote the protection and safety of children\u2026 Like swimming pools, electrical outlets, matchbooks, and household poison, they\u2019re [guns] treated simply as a fact of everyday life.\u201d [ 84 ] According to Kyle Wintersteen, Managing Editor of Guns and Ammo , studies show that \u201cchildren taught about firearms and their legitimate uses by family members have much lower rates of delinquency than children in households without guns\u201d and \u201cchildren introduced to guns associate them with freedom, security, and recreation\u2014not violence.\u201d [ 85 ] Con 11 Gun control laws would prevent citizens from protecting themselves from foreign invaders. The Libertarian Party stated, \u201cA responsible, well-armed and trained citizenry is the best protection against domestic crime and the threat of foreign invasion.\u201d [ 86 ] Counsel for the NRA stated, \u201cIt is evident that the framers of the Constitution did not intend to limit the right to keep and bear arms to a formal military body or organized militia, but intended to provide for an \u2018unorganized\u2019 armed citizenry prepared to assist in the common defense against a foreign invader or a domestic tyrant.\u201d [ 87 ] Marco Rubio (R-FL), US Senator, speaking about gun control laws during his 2016 presidential campaign, stated, \u201cIf God forbid, ISIS visits our life, our neighborhood, our school, any part of us, the last thing standing, the last line of defense could very well be our ability to protect ourselves.\u201d [ 149 ] Con 12 Strict gun control laws do not work in Mexico, and will not work in the United States. Mexico has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world and yet, in 2012, Mexico had 11,309 gun murders (9.97 gun homicides per 100,000 people) compared to the United States that had 9,146 gun homicides (2.97 per 100,000 people). [ 88 ] [ 89 ] . The country has only one legal gun store (the Directorate of Arms and Munitions Sales), compared to at least 63,709 legal gun stores and pawn shops in the United States as of Feb. 10, 2014. [ 90 ] [ 91 ] Mexico\u2019s gun store is on a secure military base and customers must present a valid ID, go through a metal detector, and turn over cellphones and cameras to guards. To actually buy a gun, customers have to show proof of honest income, provide references, pass a criminal background check, prove any military duties were completed with honor, and be fingerprinted and photographed. If allowed to purchase a gun, the customer may buy only one gun (choosing from only .38 caliber pistols or lower) and one box of bullets. [ 90 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] Between 2006 and 2010, Mexico\u2019s one gun shop sold 6,490 guns, [ 92 ] yet as of 2012, Mexicans own about 15,000,000 guns, or about 13.5 guns per 100 people. [ 44 ] Con 13 Gun control laws are racist. Current gun control laws are frequently aimed at inner city, poor, black communities who are perceived as more dangerous than white gun owners. [ 94 ] [ 95 ] Charles Gallagher, MA, PhD, the Chair of Sociology at LaSalle University, stated that some gun control laws are still founded on racial fears: \u201cWhites walking down Main Street with an AK-47 are defenders of American values; a black man doing the same thing is Public Enemy No. 1.\u201d [ 96 ] In the late 1960s, gun control laws were enacted in reaction to the militant, gun-carrying Black Panthers. [ 97 ] Adam Winkler, MA, JD, UCLA Constitutional Law Professor, stated \u201cThe KKK began as a gun-control organization. Before the Civil War, blacks were never allowed to own guns\u201d so, after the Civil War, there was \u201cconstant pressure among white racists to keep guns out of the hands of African Americans because they would rise up and revolt.\u201d [ 97 ] In Virginia, in response to Nat Turner\u2019s Rebellion (also called the Southampton Rebellion, in which slaves killed 55 to 65 people in the most fatal slave uprising in the United States) in 1831, a law was passed that prohibited free black people \u201cto keep or carry any firelock of any kind, any military weapon, or any powder or lead and all laws allowing free black people to possess firearms were repealed. [ 98 ] . Con 14 The Second Amendment was intended to protect gun ownership of all able-bodied men so that they could participate in the militia to keep the peace and defend the country if needed. According to the United States Code, a \u201cmilitia\u201d is composed of all \u201cable-bodied males at least 17 years of age\u2026 under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard.\u201d [ 99 ] Therefore, the militia mentioned in the Second Amendment would have been composed of almost all adult men and, in turn, that most adult men should not have their right to own firearms infringed. [ 100 ] A 1792 federal law required that every man eligible for militia service own a gun and ammunition suitable for military service, report for frequent inspection of their guns, and register their gun ownership on public records. [ 101 ] Daniel J. Schultz, lawyer, stated, \u201cthe Framers [of the Constitution and Bill of Rights] understood that \u2018well-regulated\u2019 militias, that is, armed citizens, ready to form militias that would be well trained, self-regulated and disciplined would post no threat to their fellow citizens, but would, indeed, help to \u2018insure domestic Tranquility\u2019 and \u2018provide for the common defence.'\u201d [ 100 ] Con 15 Gun control efforts have proved ineffective. According to David Lampo, Publications Director of the Cato Institute, \u201cthere is no correlation between waiting periods and murder or robbery rates.\u201d [ 102 ] Banning high-capacity magazines will not necessarily deter crime because even small gun magazines can be changed in seconds.The \u201cgun show loophole\u201d is virtually nonexistent because commercial dealers, who sell the majority of guns at shows and elsewhere, are bound by strict federal laws. [ 102 ] According to a Mar. 10, 2016 Lancet study, most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates, and, of 25 state laws, nine were associated with higher gun death rates.

The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution gives Americans the right to bear arms, and about a third of U.S. adults say they personally own a gun. At the same time, President Joe Biden and other policymakers earlier this year proposed new restrictions on firearm access in an effort to address gun violence ranging from rising murder rates in some major cities to mass shootings . Here are some key findings about Americans\u2019 attitudes about gun violence, gun policy and other subjects, drawn from recent surveys by Pew Research Center and Gallup. How we did this Four-in-ten U.S. adults say they live in a household with a gun, including 30% who say they personally own one, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in June 2021. There are differences in gun ownership rates by political party affiliation, gender, geography and other factors. For instance, 44% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say they personally own a gun, compared with 20% of Democrats and Democratic leaners. Men are more likely than women to say they own a gun (39% vs. 22%). And 41% of adults living in rural areas report owning a firearm, compared with about 29% of those living in the suburbs and two-in-ten living in cities. Federal data suggests that gun sales have risen in recent years, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic . In 2020, the number of monthly federal background checks for gun purchases was consistently at least 20% higher than in the same month in 2019, according to the FBI\u2019s National Instant Criminal Background Check System . The largest comparative percentage point difference occurred in July 2020 \u2013 when about 3.6 million background checks were completed, 44% more than were conducted in July 2019. Personal protection tops the list of reasons why gun owners say they own a firearm. In a Gallup survey conducted in August 2019, gun owners were most likely to cite personal safety or protection as the reason they own a firearm . Roughly six-in-ten (63%) said this in an open-ended question. Considerably smaller shares gave other reasons, including hunting (40%), nonspecific recreation or sport (11%), that their gun was an antique or a family heirloom (6%) or that the gun was related to their line of work (5%). A Pew Research Center survey conducted in 2017 found similar patterns in firearm owners\u2019 stated reasons for owning a gun. Around half of Americans (48%) see gun violence as a very big problem in the country today, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in April 2021. That\u2019s comparable to the share who say the same about the federal budget deficit (49%), violent crime (48%), illegal immigration (48%) and the coronavirus outbreak (47%). Only one issue is viewed as a very big problem by a majority of Americans: the affordability of health care (56%). Another 24% of adults say gun violence is a moderately big problem. About three-in-ten say it is either a small problem (22%) or not a problem at all (6%). Attitudes about gun violence differ widely by race, ethnicity, party and community type. About eight-in-ten Black adults (82%) say gun violence is a very big problem \u2013 by far the largest share of any racial or ethnic group. By comparison, about six-in-ten Hispanic adults (58%) and 39% of White adults view gun violence this way. (Due to sample size limitations, data for Asian Americans is not available.) Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are far more likely than Republicans and GOP leaners to see gun violence as a major problem (73% vs. 18%). And nearly two-thirds of Americans who describe their community as urban (65%) say the same, compared with 47% of suburbanites and 35% of those who live in rural areas. Roughly half of Americans (53%) favor stricter gun laws, a decline since 2019, according to the Center\u2019s April 2021 survey. Smaller shares say these laws are about right (32%) or should be less strict (14%). The share of Americans who say gun laws should be stricter has decreased from 60% in September 2019. Current opinions are in line with what they were in March 2017. Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, views have shifted. Republicans are currently more likely to say gun laws should be less strict (27%) than stricter (20%). In 2019, by comparison, a larger share of Republicans favored stricter gun laws than less strict laws (31% vs. 20%). Both years, roughly half of Republicans said current gun laws were about right. Today, a large majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners (81%) say gun laws should be stricter, though this share has declined slightly since 2019 (down from 86%). Americans are divided over whether restricting legal gun ownership would lead to fewer mass shootings. Debates over the nation\u2019s gun laws have often followed recent mass shootings . But Americans are split over whether legal changes would lead to fewer mass shootings, according to the same spring 2021 poll. About half of adults (49%) say there would be fewer mass shootings if it was harder for people to obtain guns legally, while about as many either say this would make no difference (42%) or that there would be more mass shootings (9%). The public is even more divided about the effects of gun ownership on crime overall. Around a third (34%) say that if more people owned guns, there would be more crime.

For other uses, see Steampunk (disambiguation) .\nSteampunk is a subgenre of science fiction that incorporates retrofuturistic technology and aesthetics inspired by 19th-century industrial steam-powered machinery. [1] [2] [3] Steampunk works are often set in an alternative history of the Victorian era or the American \"Wild West\" , where steam power remains in mainstream use, or in a fantasy world that similarly employs steam power.\nSteampunk most recognizably features anachronistic technologies or retrofuturistic inventions as people in the 19th century might have envisioned them \u2014 distinguishing it from Neo-Victorianism [4] \u2014 and is likewise rooted in the era's perspective on fashion, culture, architectural style, and art. [5] Such technologies may include fictional machines like those found in the works of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne . [6] Other examples of steampunk contain alternative-history-style presentations of such technology as steam cannons , lighter-than-air airships , analog computers , or such digital mechanical computers as Charles Babbage 's Analytical Engine . [7] [8]\nSteampunk may also incorporate additional elements from the genres of fantasy , horror , historical fiction , alternate history, or other branches of speculative fiction , making it often a hybrid genre . [9] As a form of speculative fiction, it explores alternative futures or pasts but can also address real-world social issues. [10] The first known appearance of the term steampunk was in 1987, though it now retroactively refers to many works of fiction created as far back as the 1950s or earlier [11] A popular subgenre is Japanese steampunk, consisting of steampunk-themed manga and anime , [12] with steampunk elements having appeared in mainstream manga since the 1940s. [13]\nSteampunk also refers to any of the artistic styles, clothing fashions, or subcultures that have developed from the aesthetics of steampunk fiction, Victorian-era fiction, art nouveau design, and films from the mid-20th century. [14] Various modern utilitarian objects have been modded by individual artisans into a pseudo-Victorian mechanical \"steampunk\" style, and a number of visual and musical artists have been described as steampunk. [15]\nSteampunk is influenced by and often adopts the style of the 19th-century scientific romances of Jules Verne , H. G. Wells , Mary Shelley , and Edward S. Ellis 's The Steam Man of the Prairies . [16] Several more modern works of art and fiction significant to the development of the genre were produced before the genre had a name. Titus Alone (1959), by Mervyn Peake , is widely regarded by scholars as the first novel in the genre proper, [17] [18] [19] while others point to Michael Moorcock 's 1971 novel The Warlord of the Air , [20] [21] [22] which was heavily influenced by Peake's work. The film Brazil (1985) was an early cinematic influence, although it can also be considered a precursor to the steampunk offshoot dieselpunk . [23] The Adventures of Luther Arkwright was an early (1970s) comic version of the Moorcock -style mover between timestreams . [24] [25]\nIn fine art, Remedios Varo 's paintings combine elements of Victorian dress, fantasy, and technofantasy imagery. [26] [ page needed ] In television , one of the earliest manifestations of the steampunk ethos in the mainstream media was the CBS television series The Wild Wild West (1965\u201369), which inspired the later film . [16] [8]\nAlthough many works now considered seminal to the genre were published in the 1960s and 1970s, the term steampunk originated largely in the 1980s [27] as a tongue-in-cheek variant of cyberpunk . It was coined by science fiction author K. W. Jeter , [28] who was trying to find a general term for works by Tim Powers ( The Anubis Gates , 1983), James Blaylock ( Homunculus , 1986), and himself ( Morlock Night , 1979, and Infernal Devices , 1987) \u2014 all of which took place in a 19th-century (usually Victorian) setting and imitated conventions of such actual Victorian speculative fiction as H. G. Wells ' The Time Machine . In a letter to science fiction magazine Locus , [27] printed in the April 1987 issue, Jeter wrote:\nDear Locus,\nEnclosed is a copy of my 1979 novel Morlock Night ; I'd appreciate your being so good as to route it to Faren Miller, as it's a prime piece of evidence in the great debate as to who in \"the Powers/Blaylock/Jeter fantasy triumvirate\" was writing in the \"gonzo-historical manner\" first. Though of course, I did find her review in the March Locus to be quite flattering.\nPersonally, I think Victorian fantasies are going to be the next big thing, as long as we can come up with a fitting collective term for Powers, Blaylock and myself. Something based on the appropriate technology of the era; like \"steam-punks,\" perhaps....\nWhile Jeter's Morlock Night and Infernal Devices , Powers' The Anubis Gates , and Blaylock's Lord Kelvin's Machine were the first novels to which Jeter's neologism would be applied, the three authors gave the term little thought at the time. [7] : 48 They were far from the first modern science fiction writers to speculate on the development of steam-based technology or alternative histories. Keith Laumer 's Worlds of the Imperium (1962) and Ronald W. Clark 's Queen Victoria's Bomb (1967) apply modern speculation to past-age technology and society. [31] [ page needed ] Michael Moorcock 's Warlord of the Air (1971) [22] is another early example. Harry Harrison 's novel A Transatlantic Tunnel, Hurrah! (1973) portrays Britain in an alternative 1973, full of atomic locomotives, coal-powered flying boats, ornate submarines, and Victorian dialogue. The Adventures of Luther Arkwright (mid-1970s) was one of the first steampunk comics. [ citation needed ] In February 1980, Richard A. Lupoff and Steve Stiles published the first \"chapter\" of their 10-part comic strip The Adventures of Professor Thintwhistle and His Incredible Aether Flyer . [32] In 2004, one anonymous author described steampunk as \"Colonizing the Past so we can dream the future.\" [33]\nThe first use of the word \"steampunk\" in a title was in Paul Di Filippo 's 1995 Steampunk Trilogy , [22] consisting of three short novels: \"Victoria\", \"Hottentots\", and \"Walt and Emily\", which, respectively, imagine the replacement of Queen Victoria by a human/newt clone, an invasion of Massachusetts by Lovecraftian monsters, and a love affair between Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson .\nSee also: Japanese cyberpunk\nJapanese steampunk consists of steampunk manga comics and anime productions from Japan. [12] Steampunk elements have consistently appeared in mainstream manga since the 1940s, dating back to Osamu Tezuka 's epic science-fiction trilogy consisting of Lost World (1948), Metropolis (1949) and Nextworld (1951). The steampunk elements found in manga eventually made their way into mainstream anime productions starting in the 1970s, including television shows such as Leiji Matsumoto 's Space Battleship Yamato (1974) and the 1979 anime adaptation of Riyoko Ikeda 's manga Rose of Versailles (1972). Influenced by 19th-century European authors such as Jules Verne, steampunk anime and manga arose from a Japanese fascination with an imaginary fantastical version of old Industrial Europe, linked to a phenomenon called akogare no Pari (\"the Paris of our dreams\"), comparable to the West 's fascination with an \"exotic\" East . [13]\nThe most influential steampunk animator was Hayao Miyazaki , who was creating steampunk anime since the 1970s, starting with the television show Future Boy Conan (1978). [13] His manga Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (1982) and its 1984 anime film adaptation also contained steampunk elements. Miyazaki's most influential steampunk production was the Studio Ghibli anime film Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986), which became a major milestone in the genre and has been described by The Steampunk Bible as \"one of the first modern steampunk classics.\" [34] Archetypal steampunk elements in Laputa include airships , air pirates , steam-powered robots , and a view of steam power as a limitless but potentially dangerous source of power. [13]\nThe success of Laputa inspired Hideaki Anno and Studio Gainax to create their first hit production, Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water (1990), a steampunk anime show which loosely adapts elements from Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea , with Captain Nemo making an appearance. [13] Based on a concept by Miyazaki, Nadia was influential on later steampunk anime such as Katsuhiro Otomo 's anime film Steamboy (2004). [35] Disney 's animated steampunk film Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001) [16] was influenced by anime, particularly Miyazaki's works and possibly Nadia . [36] [37] Other popular Japanese steampunk works include Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli anime films Porco Rosso (1992) [12] and Howl's Moving Castle (2004), [13] Sega 's video game and anime franchise Sakura Wars (1996) which is set in a steampunk version of Meiji / Taish\u014d era Japan, [13] and Square Enix 's manga and anime franchise Fullmetal Alchemist (2001). [12]\nSteampunk used to be confused with retrofuturism . [38] Indeed, both sensibilities recall \"the older but still modern eras in which technological change seemed to anticipate a better world, one remembered as relatively innocent of industrial decline.\" For some scholars, retrofuturism is considered a strand of steampunk, one that looks at alternatives to historical imagination and usually created with the same kinds of social protagonists and written for the same type of audiences. [39]\nOne of steampunk's most significant contributions is the way in which it mixes digital media with traditional handmade art forms. As scholars Rachel Bowser and Brian Croxall put it, \"the tinkering and tinker-able technologies within steampunk invite us to roll up our sleeves and get to work re-shaping our contemporary world.\" [40] In this respect, steampunk bears more in common with DIY craft and making.

( March 2017 )\nMany of the visualisations of steampunk have their origins with, among others, Walt Disney 's film 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954), [42] including the design of the story's submarine the Nautilus , its interiors, and the crew's underwater gear; and George Pal 's film The Time Machine (1960), especially the design of the time machine itself. This theme is also carried over to Six Flags Magic Mountain and Disney parks, in the themed area the \"Screampunk District\" at Six Flags Magic Mountain and in the designs of The Mysterious Island section of Tokyo DisneySea theme park and Disneyland Paris ' Discoveryland area. [ citation needed ]\nAspects of steampunk design emphasise a balance between form and function. [43] In this it is like the Arts and Crafts Movement . But John Ruskin , William Morris , and the other reformers in the late nineteenth century rejected machines and industrial production. In contrast, steampunk enthusiasts present a \"non- luddite critique of technology\". [44]\nVarious modern utilitarian objects have been modified by enthusiasts into a pseudo-Victorian mechanical \"steampunk\" style. [25] [45] Examples include computer keyboards and electric guitars . [46] The goal of such redesigns is to employ appropriate materials (such as polished brass, iron, wood, and leather) with design elements and craftsmanship consistent with the Victorian era, [22] [47] rejecting the aesthetic of industrial design . [43]\nIn 1994, the Paris Metro station at Arts et M\u00e9tiers was redesigned by Belgian artist Francois Schuiten in steampunk style, to honor the works of Jules Verne. The station is reminiscent of a submarine, sheathed in brass with giant cogs in the ceiling and portholes that look out onto fanciful scenes. [48] [49]\nThe artist group Kinetic Steam Works [50] brought a working steam engine to the Burning Man festival in 2006 and 2007. [51] The group's founding member, Sean Orlando, created a Steampunk Tree House (in association with a group of people who would later form the Five Ton Crane Arts Group [52] ) that has been displayed at a number of festivals. [53] [54] The Steampunk Tree House is now permanently installed at the Dogfish Head Brewery in Milton, Delaware . [55]\nThe Neverwas Haul is a three-story, self-propelled mobile art vehicle built to resemble a Victorian house on wheels. Designed by Shannon O\u2019Hare, it was built by volunteers in 2006 and presented at the Burning Man festival from 2006 through 2015. [56] When fully built, the Haul propelled itself at a top speed of 5 miles per hour and required a crew of ten people to operate safely. Currently, the Neverwas Haul makes her home at Obtainium Works, an \"art car factory\" in Vallejo, CA owned by O\u2019Hare and home to several other self-styled \"contraptionists\". [57]\nIn May\u2013June 2008, multimedia artist and sculptor Paul St George exhibited outdoor interactive video installations linking London and Brooklyn , New York, in a Victorian era-styled telectroscope . [58] [59] Utilizing this device, New York promoter Evelyn Kriete organised a transatlantic wave between steampunk enthusiasts from both cities, [60] prior to White Mischief's Around the World in 80 Days steampunk-themed event. [61]\nIn 2009, for Questacon , artist Tim Wetherell created a large wall piece that represented the concept of the clockwork universe. This steel artwork contains moving gears, a working clock, and a movie of the moon's terminator in action. The 3D moon movie was created by Antony Williams. [62]\nSteampunk became a common descriptor for homemade objects sold on the craft network Etsy between 2009 and 2011, [63] though many of the objects and fashions bear little resemblance to earlier established descriptions of steampunk. Thus the craft network may not strike observers as \"sufficiently steampunk\" to warrant its use of the term. Comedian April Winchell , author of the book Regretsy: Where DIY meets WTF , cataloged some of the most egregious and humorous examples on her website \"Regretsy\". [64] The blog was popular among steampunks and even inspired a music video that went viral in the community and was acclaimed by steampunk \"notables\". [65]\nFrom October 2009 through February 2010, the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford , hosted the first major exhibition of steampunk art objects, curated and developed by New York artist and designer Art Donovan, [66] who also exhibited his own \"electro-futuristic\" lighting sculptures, and presented by Dr. Jim Bennett, museum director. [67] From redesigned practical items to fantastical contraptions, this exhibition showcased the work of eighteen steampunk artists from around the globe. The exhibit proved to be the most successful and highly attended in the museum's history and attracted more than eighty thousand visitors. The event was detailed in the official artist's journal The Art of Steampunk , by curator Donovan. [68]\nIn November 2010, The Libratory Steampunk Art Gallery was opened by Damien McNamara in Oamaru, New Zealand . Created from papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 to resemble a large cave and filled with industrial equipment from yesteryear, rayguns , and general steampunk quirks, its purpose is to provide a place for steampunkers in the region to display artwork for sale all year long. A year later, a more permanent gallery, Steampunk HQ , was opened in the former Meeks Grain Elevator Building across the road from The Woolstore, and has since become a notable tourist attraction for Oamaru. [69]\nIn 2012, the Mobilis in Mobili: An Exhibition of Steampunk Art and Appliance made its debut. Originally located at New York City's Wooster Street Social Club (itself the subject of the television series NY Ink ), the exhibit featured working steampunk tattoo systems designed by Bruce Rosenbaum, of ModVic and owner of the Steampunk House, [70] Joey \"Dr. Grymm\" Marsocci, [46] and Christopher Conte. [71] with different approaches. [42] \"[B]icycles, cell phones, guitars, timepieces and entertainment systems\" [71] rounded out the display. [46] The opening night exhibition featured a live performance by steampunk band Frenchy and the Punk . [72]\nThe stills at The Oxford Artisan Distillery are nicknamed \" Nautilus \" and \" Nemo \", named after the submarine and its captain in the Jules Verne 1870 science fiction novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas . They were built in copper by South Devon Railway Engineering using a steampunk style. [73]\nMain article: Steampunk fashion\nSome of this section's listed sources may not be reliable .

( November 2020 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )\nSteampunk fashion has no set guidelines but tends to synthesize modern styles with influences from the Victorian era. Such influences may include bustles , corsets , gowns, and petticoats ; suits with waistcoats , coats, top hats [74] and bowler hats (themselves originating in 1850 England), tailcoats and spats ; or military-inspired garments. Steampunk-influenced outfits are usually accented with several technological and \"period\" accessories: timepieces, parasols , flying/driving goggles, [75] and ray guns. Modern accessories like cell phones or music players can be found in steampunk outfits, after being modified to give them the appearance of Victorian-era objects. Post-apocalyptic elements, such as gas masks, ragged clothing, and tribal motifs, can also be included. Aspects of steampunk fashion have been anticipated by mainstream high fashion, the Lolita and aristocrat styles, neo-Victorianism, and the Romantic Goth subculture . [24] [76] [77]\nIn 2005, Kate Lambert , known as \"Kato\", founded the first steampunk clothing company, \"Steampunk Couture\", [78] mixing Victorian and post-apocalyptic influences. In 2013, IBM predicted, based on an analysis of more than a half million public posts on message boards, blogs, social media sites, and news sources, \"that 'steampunk,' a subgenre inspired by the clothing, technology and social mores of Victorian society, will be a major trend to bubble up and take hold of the retail industry\". [79] [80] Indeed, high fashion lines such as Prada , [81] Dolce & Gabbana , Versace , Chanel , [82] and Christian Dior [80] had already been introducing steampunk styles on the fashion runways.\nIn episode 7 of Lifetime 's Under the Gunn reality series , contestants were challenged to create avant-garde \"steampunk chic\" looks. [83] America's Next Top Model tackled steampunk fashion in a 2012 episode where models competed in a steampunk-themed photo shoot, posing in front of a steam train while holding a live owl. [84] [ unreliable source ]\nThe educational book Elementary BASIC \u2013 Learning to Program Your Computer in BASIC with Sherlock Holmes (1981), by Henry Singer and Andrew Ledgar , may have been the first fictional work to depict the use of Charles Babbage 's Analytical Engine in an adventure story. The instructional book, aimed at young programming students, depicts Holmes using the engine as an aid in his investigations, and lists programs that perform simple data processing tasks required to solve the fictional cases. The book even describes a device that allows the engine to be used remotely, over telegraph lines, as a possible enhancement to Babbage's machine. Companion volumes\u2014 Elementary Pascal \u2013 Learning to Program Your Computer in Pascal with Sherlock Holmes and From Baker Street to Binary \u2013 An Introduction to Computers and Computer Programming with Sherlock Holmes \u2014were also written.\nIn 1988, the first version of the science fiction tabletop role-playing game Space: 1889 was published. The game is set in an alternative history in which certain now discredited Victorian scientific theories were probable and led to new technologies. Contributing authors included Frank Chadwick , Loren Wiseman , and Marcus Rowland . [85]\nWilliam Gibson and Bruce Sterling 's novel The Difference Engine (1990) is often credited with bringing about widespread awareness of steampunk. [8] [86] This novel applies the principles of Gibson and Sterling's cyberpunk writings to an alternative Victorian era where Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage 's proposed steam-powered mechanical computer, which Babbage called a difference engine (a later, more general-purpose version was known as an Analytical Engine ), was actually built, and led to the dawn of the information age more than a century \"ahead of schedule\". This setting was different from most steampunk settings in that it takes a dim and dark view of this future, rather than the more prevalent utopian versions.\nNick Gevers 's original anthology Extraordinary Engines (2008) features newer steampunk stories by some of the genre's writers, as well as other science fiction and fantasy writers experimenting with neo-Victorian conventions. A retrospective reprint anthology of steampunk fiction was released, also in 2008, by Tachyon Publications . Edited by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer and appropriately entitled Steampunk , it is a collection of stories by James Blaylock , whose \"Narbondo\" trilogy is typically considered steampunk; Jay Lake , author of the novel Mainspring , sometimes labeled \" clockpunk \"; [87] the aforementioned Michael Moorcock; as well as Jess Nevins , known for his annotations to The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (first published in 1999).\nYounger readers have also been targeted by steampunk themes, by authors such as Philip Reeve and Scott Westerfeld . [88] Reeve's quartet Mortal Engines is set far in Earth's future where giant moving cities consume each other in a battle for resources, a concept Reeve coined as Municipal Darwinism . Westerfeld's Leviathan trilogy is set during an alternate First World War fought between the \"clankers\" ( Central Powers ), who use steam technology, and \"darwinists\" ( Allied Powers ), who use genetically engineered creatures instead of machines. [89]\n\"Mash-ups\" are also becoming increasingly popular in books aimed at younger readers, mixing steampunk with other genres. Stefan Bachmann 's The Peculiar duology was labeled a \"steampunk fairytale,\" and imagines steampunk technology as a means to stave off an incursion of faeries in Victorian England. [90] Suzanne Lazear's Aether Chronicles series also mixes steampunk with faeries, and The Unnaturalists , by Tiffany Trent, combines steampunk with mythological creatures and alternate history. [91]\nWhile most of the original steampunk works had a historical setting, [ citation needed ] later works often place steampunk elements in a fantasy world with little relation to any specific historic era. Historical steampunk tends to be science fiction that presents an alternate history; it also contains real locales and persons from history with alternative fantasy technology. \"Fantasy-world steampunk\", such as China Mi\u00e9ville 's Perdido Street Station , Alan Campbell's Scar Night , and Stephen Hunt's Jackelian novels, on the other hand, presents steampunk in a completely imaginary fantasy realm , often populated by legendary creatures coexisting with steam-era and other anachronistic technologies. However, the works of China Mi\u00e9ville and similar authors are sometimes referred to as belonging to the \" New Weird \" rather than steampunk. [ citation needed ]\nSelf-described author of \"far-fetched fiction\" Robert Rankin has incorporated elements of steampunk into narrative worlds that are both Victorian and re-imagined contemporary. In 2009, he was made a Fellow of the Victorian Steampunk Society. [92]\nThe comic book series Hellboy , created by Mike Mignola , and the two Hellboy films featuring Ron Perlman and directed by Guillermo del Toro , all have steampunk elements. [93] In the comic book and the first (2004) film , Karl Ruprecht Kroenen is a Nazi SS scientist who has an addiction to having himself surgically altered, and who has many mechanical prostheses, including a clockwork heart. The character Johann Krauss is featured in the comic and in the second film, Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008), as an ectoplasmic medium (a gaseous form in a partly mechanical suit). This second film also features the Golden Army itself, which is a collection of 4,900 mechanical steampunk warriors.\nSince the 1990s, the application of the steampunk label has expanded beyond works set in recognisable historical periods, to works set in fantasy worlds that rely heavily on steam- or spring-powered technology. [8] One of the earliest short stories relying on steam-powered flying machines is \"The Aerial Burglar\" of 1844. [94] An example from juvenile fiction is The Edge Chronicles by Paul Stewart and Chris Riddell .\nOne of the first steampunk novels set in a Middle-earth -like world was the Forest of Boland Light Railway by BB , about gnomes who build a steam locomotive . Fifty years later, Terry Pratchett wrote the Discworld novel Raising Steam , about the ongoing industrial revolution and railway mania in Ankh-Morpork .\nThe gnomes and goblins in World of Warcraft also have technological societies that could be described as steampunk, [97] as they are vastly ahead of the technologies of men , but still run on steam and mechanical power.\nThe Dwarves of the Elder Scrolls series , described therein as a race of Elves called the Dwemer , also use steam-powered machinery, with gigantic brass-like gears, throughout their underground cities. However, magical means are used to keep ancient devices in motion despite the Dwemer's ancient disappearance. [98]\nThe 1998 game Thief: The Dark Project , as well as the other sequels including its 2014 reboot , feature heavy steampunk-inspired architecture, setting, and technology.\nAmidst the historical and fantasy subgenres of steampunk is a type that takes place in a hypothetical future or a fantasy equivalent of our future involving the domination of steampunk-style technology and aesthetics . Examples include Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro 's The City of Lost Children (1995), Turn A Gundam (1999\u20132000), Trigun , [99] and Disney's film Treasure Planet (2002). In 2011, musician Thomas Dolby heralded his return to music after a 20-year hiatus with an online steampunk alternate fantasy world called the Floating City, to promote his album A Map of the Floating City . [16]\nAnother setting is \"Western\" steampunk, which overlaps with both the Weird West and Science fiction Western subgenres. One of the earliest steampunk books set in America was The Steam Man of the Prairies by Edward S. Ellis . Recent examples include the TV show and the movie adaption Wild Wild West , the Italian comics about Magico Vento , [100] Devon Monk 's Dead Iron , [101] and the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad in Disneyland -style Disney Parks around the world. [ citation needed ]\nSee also: Cyberpunk derivatives\nKaja Foglio introduced the term \"Gaslight Romance\", [7] : 78 gaslamp fantasy , which John Clute and John Grant define as \"steampunk stories ... most commonly set in a romanticised, smoky, 19th-century London, as are Gaslight Romances. But the latter category focuses nostalgically on icons from the late years of that century and the early years of the 20th century\u2014on Dracula , Jekyll and Hyde , Jack the Ripper , Sherlock Holmes and even Tarzan \u2014and can normally be understood as combining supernatural fiction and recursive fantasy , though some gaslight romances can be read as fantasies of history.\" [9] Author/artist James Richardson-Brown [102] coined the term steamgoth to refer to steampunk expressions of fantasy and horror with a \"darker\" bent.\nMary Shelley 's The Last Man , set near the end of the 21st century after a plague had brought down civilization, was probably the ancestor of post-apocalyptic steampunk literature. Post-apocalyptic steampunk is set in a world where some cataclysm has precipitated the fall of civilization and steam power is once again ascendant, such as in Hayao Miyazaki 's post-apocalyptic anime Future Boy Conan (1978, loosely based on Alexander Key 's The Incredible Tide (1970)), [99] where a war fought with superweapons has devastated the planet. Robert Brown 's novel, The Wrath of Fate (as well as much of Abney Park 's music) is set in a Victorianesque world where an apocalypse was set into motion by a time-traveling mishap. Cherie Priest 's Boneshaker series is set in a world where a zombie apocalypse happened during the Civil War era. The Peshawar Lancers by S.M. Stirling is set in a post-apocalyptic future in which a meteor shower in 1878 caused the collapse of industrialized civilization. The movie 9 (which might be better classified as \"stitchpunk\" but was largely influenced by steampunk) [103] is also set in a post-apocalyptic world after a self-aware war machine ran amok. Steampunk Magazine even published a book called A Steampunk's Guide to the Apocalypse , about how steampunks could survive should such a thing actually happen.\nIn general, this category includes any recent science fiction that takes place in a recognizable historical period (sometimes an alternate history version of an actual historical period) in which the Industrial Revolution has already begun, but electricity is not yet widespread, \"usually Britain of the early to mid-nineteenth century or the fantasized Wild West -era United States\", [104] with an emphasis on steam- or spring-propelled gadgets. The most common historical steampunk settings are the Victorian and Edwardian eras , though some in this \"Victorian steampunk\" category are set as early as the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and as late as the end of World War I .\nSome examples of this type include the novel The Difference Engine , [105] the comic book series League of Extraordinary Gentlemen , the Disney animated film Atlantis: The Lost Empire , [16] Scott Westerfeld 's Leviathan trilogy , [106] and the roleplaying game Space: 1889 . [16] The anime film Steamboy (2004) is another example of Victorian steampunk, taking place in an alternate 1866 where steam technology is far more advanced than reality. [107] Some, such as the comic series Girl Genius , [16] have their own unique times and places despite partaking heavily of the flavor of historic settings. Other comic series are set in a more familiar London, as in the Victorian Undead , which has Sherlock Holmes , Doctor Watson , and others taking on zombies, Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde , and Count Dracula , with advanced weapons and devices. Another example of this genre is the Tunnels novels by Roderick Gordon and Brian Williams. These are set in the modern day, but with an underground Victorian world that is working to overthrow the world above. Detective graphic novel series Lady Mechanika is set in an alternative Victorian-like world.\nKarel Zeman 's film The Fabulous World of Jules Verne (1958) is a very early example of cinematic steampunk. Based on Jules Verne novels, Zeman's film imagines a past that never was, based on those novels. [108] Other early examples of historical steampunk in cinema include Hayao Miyazaki 's anime films such as Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986) and Howl's Moving Castle (2004), which contain many archetypal anachronisms characteristic of the steampunk genre. [109] [110]\n\"Historical\" steampunk usually leans more towards science fiction than fantasy, but a number of historical steampunk stories have incorporated magical elements as well. For example, Morlock Night , written by K. W. Jeter , revolves around an attempt by the wizard Merlin to raise King Arthur to save the Britain of 1892 from an invasion of Morlocks from the future. [8]\nPaul Guinan 's Boilerplate , a \"biography\" of a robot in the late 19th century, began as a website that garnered international press coverage when people began believing that Photoshop images of the robot with historic personages were real. [111] The site was adapted into the illustrated hardbound book Boilerplate: History's Mechanical Marvel , which was published by Abrams in October 2009. [112] Because the story was not set in an alternative history, and in fact contained accurate information about the Victorian era, [113] some [ specify ] booksellers referred to the tome as \"historical steampunk\".\nFictional settings inspired by East Asian rather than Western history, especially those inspired by Chinese history , have been called \"silkpunk\". The term originated with the author Ken Liu , [114] who defined it as \"a blend of science fiction and fantasy [that] draws inspiration from classical East Asian antiquity\", with a \"technology vocabulary (...) based on organic materials historically important to East Asia (bamboo, paper, silk) and seafaring cultures of the Pacific (coconut, feathers, coral)\", rather than the brass and leather associated with steampunk. Liu used the term to describe his Dandelion Dynasty series, which began in 2015. [115] Other works described as silkpunk include Neon Yang 's Tensorate series of novellas, which began in 2017. [116] Lyndsie Manusos of Book Riot has argued that the genre does \"not fit in a direct analogy with steampunk. Silkpunk is technology and poetics. It is engineering and language.\" [117]\nSteampunk music is very broadly defined. Abney Park 's lead singer Robert Brown defined it as \"mixing Victorian elements and modern elements\". There is a broad range of musical influences that make up the steampunk sound, from industrial dance and world music [77] to folk rock , dark cabaret to straightforward punk , [118] Carnatic [119] to industrial , hip-hop to opera (and even industrial hip-hop opera ), [120] [121] darkwave to progressive rock , barbershop to big band .\nJoshua Pfeiffer (of Vernian Process ) is quoted as saying, \"As for Paul Roland , if anyone deserves credit for spearheading Steampunk music, it is him. He was one of the inspirations I had in starting my project. He was writing songs about the first attempt at manned flight, and an Edwardian airship raid in the mid-80s long before almost anyone else ...\" [122] Thomas Dolby is also considered one of the early pioneers of retro-futurist (i.e., Steampunk and Dieselpunk) music. [123] [124] Amanda Palmer was once quoted as saying, \"Thomas Dolby is to Steampunk what Iggy Pop was to Punk !\" [125]\nSteampunk has also appeared in the work of musicians who do not specifically identify as steampunk. For example, the music video of \"Turn Me On\" , by David Guetta and featuring Nicki Minaj , takes place in a steampunk universe where Guetta creates human androids. Another music video is \" The Ballad of Mona Lisa \", by Panic! at the Disco , which has a distinct Victorian steampunk theme. A continuation of this theme has been used throughout the 2011 album Vices & Virtues , in the music videos, album art, and tour set and costumes. In addition, the album Clockwork Angels (2012) and its supporting tour by progressive rock band Rush contain lyrics, themes, and imagery based around steampunk. Similarly, Abney Park headlined the first \"Steamstock\" outdoor steampunk music festival in Richmond, California , which also featured Thomas Dolby , Frenchy and the Punk , Lee Presson and the Nails , Vernian Process , and others. [124]\nThe music video for the Lindsey Stirling song \"Roundtable Rival\", has a Western steampunk setting.\nThe Fabulous World of Jules Verne (1958) and The Fabulous Baron Munchausen (1962), both directed by Karel Zeman , have steampunk elements. The 1965 television series The Wild Wild West , as well as the 1999 film of the same name , features many elements of advanced steam-powered technology set in the Wild West time period of the United States. Two Years' Vacation (or The Stolen Airship ) (1967) directed by Karel Zeman contains steampunk elements.\nThe BBC series Doctor Who also incorporates steampunk elements. Several storylines can be classed as steampunk, most notably The Evil of the Daleks (1966), wherein Victorian scientists invent a time travel device using mirrors and static electricity. [126] During season 14 of the show (in 1976), the formerly futuristic looking interior set was replaced with a Victorian -styled wood-panel and brass affair. [127] In the 1996 American co-production, the TARDIS interior was re-designed to resemble an almost Victorian library with the central control console made up of an eclectic array of anachronistic objects. Modified and streamlined for the 2005 revival of the series, the TARDIS console continued to incorporate steampunk elements, including a Victorian typewriter and gramophone , for many years.\nDinner for Adele (1977) directed by Old\u0159ich Lipsk\u00fd involves steampunk contraptions. The 1979 film Time After Time has Herbert George \"H.G.\" Wells following a surgeon named John Leslie Stevenson into the future, as John is suspected of being Jack the Ripper . Both separately use Wells's time machine to travel.\nThe Mysterious Castle in the Carpathians , (1981) directed by Old\u0159ich Lipsk\u00fd , contains steampunk elements. [128] The 1982 American TV series Q.E.D. is set in Edwardian England, stars Sam Waterston as Professor Quentin Everett Deverill (from whose initials, by which he is primarily known, the series title is derived, initials which also stand for the Latin phrase quod erat demonstrandum , which translates as \"which was to be demonstrated\"). The Professor is an inventor and scientific detective, in the mold of Sherlock Holmes . The plot of the Soviet film Kin-dza-dza! (1986) centers on a desert planet , depleted of its resources, where an impoverished dog-eat-dog society uses steampunk machines, the movements and functions of which defy Earthly logic.\nIn making his 1986 Japanese film Castle in the Sky , Hayao Miyazaki was heavily influenced by steampunk culture, the film featuring various airships and steampowered contraptions as well as a mysterious island that floats through the sky, accomplished not through magic as in most stories, but instead by harnessing the physical properties of a rare crystal\u2014analogous to the lodestone used in the Laputa of Swift's Gulliver's Travels \u2014augmented by massive propellers, as befitting the Victorian motif. [129] The first \"Wallace & Gromit\" animation \" A Grand Day Out \" (1989) features a space rocket in the steampunk style. [ citation needed ]\nThe second half of Back to the Future III (1990) gradually evolves into steampunk.\nThe Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. , a 1993 Fox Network TV science fiction-Western set in the 1890s, features elements of steampunk as represented by the character Professor Wickwire, whose inventions were described as \"the coming thing\". [130] The short-lived 1995 TV show Legend , on UPN , set in 1876 Arizona , features such classic inventions as a steam-driven \"quadrovelocipede\", trigoggle and night-vision goggles (\u00e0 la teslapunk), and stars John de Lancie as a thinly disguised Nikola Tesla . [ citation needed ]\nSteamboy (2004) is a Japanese animated action film directed and co-written by Katsuhiro Otomo ( Akira ). It is a retro science-fiction epic set in a steampunk Victorian England. It features steamboats, trains, airships and inventors. The 2004 film Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events contains steampunk-esque elements such as costumes and vehicle interiors. The 2007 Syfy miniseries Tin Man incorporates a considerable number of steampunk-inspired themes into a reimagining of L. Frank Baum 's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz . Despite leaning more towards Gothic influences, the \"parallel reality\" of Meanwhile, City, within the 2009 film Franklyn contains many steampunk themes, such as costumery, architecture, minimal use of electricity (with a preference for gaslight), and absence of modern technology (such as there being no motorised vehicles or advanced weaponry, and the manual management of information without computers).\nThe 2009\u20132014 Syfy television series Warehouse 13 features many steampunk-inspired objects and artifacts, including computer designs created by steampunk artisan Richard Nagy, a.k.a. \"Datamancer\". [131] The 2010 episode of the TV series Castle entitled \"Punked\" (which first aired on October 11, 2010) prominently features the steampunk subculture and uses Los Angeles -area steampunks (such as the League of STEAM ) as extras. The 2011 film The Three Musketeers has many steampunk elements, including gadgets and airships.\nThe Legend of Korra , a 2012\u20132014 Nickelodeon animated series, incorporates steampunk elements in an industrialized world with East Asian themes. The Penny Dreadful (2014) television series is a Gothic Victorian fantasy series with steampunk props and costumes.\nThe 2015 GSN reality television game show Steampunk'd features a competition to create steampunk-inspired art and designs which are judged by notable steampunks Thomas Willeford , Kato , and Matthew Yang King (as Matt King). [132] Based on the work of cartoonist Jacques Tardi , April and the Extraordinary World (2015) is an animated movie set in a steampunk Paris. It features airships, trains, submarines, and various other steam-powered contraptions. Tim Burton 's 2016 film Alice Through the Looking Glass features steampunk costumes, props, and vehicles.\nJapanese anime Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress (2016) features a steampunk zombie apocalypse.\nThe American fantasy animated sitcom , Disenchantment , created by Matt Groening for Netflix , features a steampunk country named Steamland, led by an odd industrialist named Alva Gunderson voiced by Richard Ayoade , first appears in the season 1 episode, \"The Electric Princess.\" [133] [134] [a] The country is portrayed as driven by logic and is egalitarian , governed by science, rather than magic, as is the case for Dreamland, where the protagonist, Princess Bean , is from. [135] The country has cars, automatic lights, submarines, and other modern technologies, all of which are steam-powered, and references to Groening's other series, Futurama . [136] [137] Steamland appears in three episodes of the show's second season, [b] showing an explorers club as part of the country's high society , flying zeppelins , and robots with light bulbs for heads that chase the protagonists through the streets. [138] [139] Some even argued that Steamland is \" dieselpunk -inspired.\" [140]\nA variety of styles of video games have used steampunk settings.\nSteel Empire (1992), a shoot 'em up game originally released as Koutetsu Teikoku on the Sega Mega Drive console in Japan, is considered to be the first steampunk video game. Designed by Yoshinori Satake and inspired by Hayao Miyazaki 's anime film Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986), Steel Empire is set in an alternate timeline dominated by steam-powered technology. The commercial success of Steel Empire , both in Japan and the West, helped propel steampunk into the video game market , and had a significant influence on later steampunk games. The most notable steampunk game it influenced is Final Fantasy VI (1994), a Japanese role-playing game developed by Squaresoft and designed by Hiroyuki Ito for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System . Final Fantasy VI was both critically and commercially successful, and had a considerable influence on later steampunk video games. [35]\nThe Chaos Engine (1993) is a run and gun video game inspired by the Gibson/Sterling novel The Difference Engine (1990), set in a Victorian steampunk age. Developed by the Bitmap Brothers , it was first released on the Amiga in 1993; a sequel was released in 1996. [141] The graphic adventure puzzle video games Myst (1993), Riven (1997), Myst III: Exile (2001), and Myst IV: Revelation (all produced by or under the supervision of Cyan Worlds ) take place in an alternate steampunk universe, where elaborate infrastructures have been built to run on steam power. The Elder Scrolls (since 1994, last release in 2014) is an action role-playing game where one can find an ancient extinct race called dwemers or dwarves, whose steampunk technology is based on steam-powered levers and gears made of copper-bronze material, which are maintained by magical techniques that have kept them in working order over the centuries.\nSakura Wars (1996), a visual novel and tactical role-playing game developed by Sega for the Saturn console, is set in a steampunk version of Japan during the Meiji and Taish\u014d periods, and features steam-powered mecha robots.

[145] Some fans of the genre adopt a steampunk aesthetic through fashion, [146] home decor, music, and film. While Steampunk is considered the amalgamation of Victorian aesthetic principles with modern sensibilities and technologies, [24] it can be more broadly categorised as neo-Victorianism , described by scholar Marie-Luise Kohlke as \"the afterlife of the nineteenth century in the cultural imaginary\". [147] The subculture has its own magazine, blogs, and online shops. [148]\nIn September 2012, a panel, chaired by steampunk entertainer Veronique Chevalier and with panelists including magician Pop Hadyn and members of the steampunk performance group the League of STEAM , was held at Stan Lee 's Comikaze Expo . The panel suggested that because steampunk was inclusive of and incorporated ideas from various other subcultures such as goth, neo-Victorian, and cyberpunk, as well as a growing number of fandoms , it was fast becoming a super-culture rather than a mere subculture. [149] Other steampunk notables such as Professor Elemental have expressed similar views about steampunk's inclusive diversity. [150]\nSome have proposed a steampunk philosophy that incorporates punk-inspired anti-establishment sentiments typically bolstered by optimism about human potential. [151] A 2004 Steampunk Manifesto , later republished in SteamPunk Magazine , lamented that most \"so-called\" steampunk was nothing more than dressed-up recreationary nostalgia and proposed that \"authentic\" steampunk would \"take the levers of technology from the [technocrats] and powerful.\" [152] American activist and performer Miriam Rosenberg Rocek impersonated anarcha-feminist Emma Goldman to inspire discussions around gender, society and politics. [4] SteamPunk Magazine was edited and published by anarchists. Its founder, Margaret Killjoy , argued \"there have always been radical politics at the core of steampunk.\" [153] Diana M. Pho, a science-fiction editor and author of the multicultural steampunk blog Beyond Victoriana , similarly argued steampunk's \" progressive roots\" can be traced to its literary inspirations, including Verne's Captain Nemo . [154] Steampunk authors Phenderson Dj\u00e8l\u00ed Clark , [155] Jaymee Goh, [156] Dru Pagliassotti , [157] and Charlie Stross [158] consider their work political.\nThese views are not universally shared. [76] Killjoy lamented that even some diehard enthusiasts believe steampunk \"has nothing to offer but designer clothes.\" [153] Pho argued many steampunk fans \"don't like to acknowledge that their attitudes could be considered ideological.\" [154] The largest online steampunk community, Brass Goggles , which is dedicated to what it calls the \"lighter side\" of steampunk, banned discussion about politics. Cory Gross, who was one of the first to write about the history and theory of steampunk, argued that the \"sepia-toned yesteryear more appropriate for Disney and grandparents than a vibrant and viable philosophy or culture\" denounced in the Steampunk Manifesto [152] was in fact representative of the genre. [159] Author Catherynne M. Valente called the punk in steampunk \"nearly meaningless.\" [160] Kate Franklin and James Schafer, who at the time managed one of the largest steampunk groups on Facebook , admitted in 2011 that steampunk hadn't created the \"revolutionary, or even a particularly progressive\" community they wanted. [161] Blogger and podcaster Eric Renderking Fisk announced in 2017 that steampunk was no longer punk, since it had \"lost the anti-authoritarian, anti-establishment aspects.\" [162]\nOthers argued explicitly against turning steampunk into a political movement, [163] preferring to see steampunk as \"escapism\" [164] or a \"fandom\". [165] In 2018, Nick Ottens, editor of the online alternate-history magazine Never Was , declared that the \"lighter side\" of steampunk had won out. [166] To the extent that steampunk is politicized , it appears to be an American and British phenomenon. Continental Europeans [167] and Latin Americans [168] are more likely to consider steampunk a hobby than a cause.\nJune 19, 2005 marked the grand opening of the world's first steampunk club night, \"Malediction Society\", in Los Angeles . [169] [170] The event ran for nearly 12 years at The Monte Cristo nightclub, interrupted by a single year residency at Argyle Hollywood, until both the club night and The Monte Cristo closed in April 2017. [170] Though the steampunk aesthetic eventually gave way to a more generic goth and industrial aesthetic, Malediction Society celebrated its roots every year with \"The Steampunk Ball\". [171]\n2006 saw the first \"SalonCon\", a neo-Victorian/steampunk convention. It ran for three consecutive years and featured artists, musicians ( Voltaire and Abney Park), authors ( Catherynne M. Valente , Ekaterina Sedia , and G. D. Falksen ), salons led by people prominent in their respective fields, workshops and panels on steampunk\u2014as well as a seance, ballroom dance instruction, and the Chrononauts' Parade. The event was covered by MTV [172] and The New York Times . [24] Since then, a number of popular steampunk conventions have sprung up the world over, with names like Steamcon ( Seattle ), the Steampunk World's Fair ( Piscataway, New Jersey ), Up in the Aether: The Steampunk Convention ( Dearborn, Michigan ), [173] Steampunk NZ ( Oamaru, New Zealand ), Steampunk Unlimited ( Strasburg Railroad , Lancaster, PA ). [174] Each year, on Mother's Day weekend, the city of Waltham, MA , turns over its city center and surrounding areas to host the Watch City Steampunk Festival , a US outdoor steampunk festival. In Kennebunk, ME the Brick Store Museum hosts the Southern Maine Steampunk Fair annually. [175] [176] During the first weekend of May, the Australian town of Nimmitabel celebrates Steampunk @ Altitude with some 2,000 attendance. [177]\nIn recent years, steampunk has also become a regular feature at San Diego Comic-Con International , with the Saturday of the four-day event being generally known among steampunks as \"Steampunk Day\", and culminating with a photo-shoot for the local press. [178] [179] In 2010, this was recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's largest steampunk photo shoot. [180] In 2013, Comic-Con announced four official 2013 T-shirts, one of them featuring the official Rick Geary Comic-Con toucan mascot in steampunk attire. [181] The Saturday steampunk \"after-party\" has also become a major event on the steampunk social calendar: in 2010, the headliners included The Slow Poisoner, Unextraordinary Gentlemen, and Voltaire, with Veronique Chevalier as Mistress of Ceremonies and special appearance by the League of STEAM ; [182] [183] in 2011, UXG returned with Abney Park. [184]\nSteampunk has also sprung up recently at Renaissance Festivals and Renaissance Faires , in the US. Some festivals have organised events or a \"Steampunk Day\", while others simply support an open environment for donning steampunk attire. The Bristol Renaissance Faire in Kenosha, Wisconsin , on the Wisconsin / Illinois border, featured a Steampunk costume contest during the 2012 season, the previous two seasons having seen increasing participation in the phenomenon. [185]\nSteampunk also has a growing following in the UK and Europe. The largest European event is \" Weekend at the Asylum \", held at The Lawn, Lincoln , every September since 2009. Organised as a not-for-profit event by the Victorian Steampunk Society, the Asylum is a dedicated steampunk event which takes over much of the historical quarter of Lincoln, England , along with Lincoln Castle . In 2011, there were over 1000 steampunks in attendance. The event features the Empire Ball, Majors Review, Bazaar Eclectica, and the international Tea Duelling final. [186] [187] The Surrey Steampunk Convivial was originally held in New Malden , but since 2019 has been held in Stoneleigh in southwestern London, within walking distance of H. G. Wells 's home. [188] The Surrey Steampunk Convivial started as an annual event in 2012, and now takes place thrice a year, and has spanned three boroughs and five venues. [189] Attendees have been interviewed by BBC Radio 4 for Phill Jupitus [190] and filmed by the BBC World Service . [191] The West Yorkshire village of Haworth has held an annual Steampunk weekend since 2013, [192] on each occasion as a charity event raising funds for Sue Ryder's \"Manorlands\" hospice in Oxenhope . In September 2021, Finland 's first steampunk festival was held at the V\u00e4in\u00f6 Linna Square and the Werstas Workers' House in Tampere , Pirkanmaa , Finland. [193] [194]\nA 2018 physics Ph.D. dissertation used the phrase \"Quantum Steampunk\" to describe the author's synthesis of some 19th century and current ideas. [195] [196] The term has not been widely adopted.\nA 2012 conference paper on human factors in computing systems examines the use of steampunk as a design fiction for human-computer interaction (HCI). It concludes that \"the practices of DIY and appropriation that are evident in Steampunk design provide a useful set of design strategies and implications for HCI\". [197]\nSteampunk HQ , a museum and arts centre dedicated to steampunk in Oamaru , New Zealand , along with its associated art gallery ( The Libratory ), was the world's first steampunk museum. The town of Oamaru and the English city of Lincoln have both claimed the title of \"Steampunk Capital of the World\".

Steampunk is a subgenre of science fiction that incorporates retrofuturistic technology and aesthetics inspired by 19th-century industrial steam-powered machinery. [1] [2] [3] Steampunk works are often set in an alternative history of the Victorian era or the American \"Wild West\" , where steam power remains in mainstream use, or in a fantasy world that similarly employs steam power. Steampunk most recognizably features anachronistic technologies or retrofuturistic inventions as people in the 19th century might have envisioned them \u2014 distinguishing it from Neo-Victorianism [4] \u2014 and is likewise rooted in the era's perspective on fashion, culture, architectural style, and art. [5] Such technologies may include fictional machines like those found in the works of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne . [6] Other examples of steampunk contain alternative-history-style presentations of such technology as steam cannons , lighter-than-air airships , analog computers , or such digital mechanical computers as Charles Babbage 's Analytical Engine . [7] [8] Steampunk may also incorporate additional elements from the genres of fantasy , horror , historical fiction , alternate history, or other branches of speculative fiction , making it often a hybrid genre . [9] As a form of speculative fiction, it explores alternative futures or pasts but can also address real-world social issues. [10] The first known appearance of the term steampunk was in 1987, though it now retroactively refers to many works of fiction created as far back as the 1950s or earlier [11] A popular subgenre is Japanese steampunk, consisting of steampunk-themed manga and anime , [12] with steampunk elements having appeared in mainstream manga since the 1940s. [13] Steampunk also refers to any of the artistic styles, clothing fashions, or subcultures that have developed from the aesthetics of steampunk fiction, Victorian-era fiction, art nouveau design, and films from the mid-20th century. [14] Various modern utilitarian objects have been modded by individual artisans into a pseudo-Victorian mechanical \"steampunk\" style, and a number of visual and musical artists have been described as steampunk. [15] Steampunk is influenced by and often adopts the style of the 19th-century scientific romances of Jules Verne , H. G. Wells , Mary Shelley , and Edward S. Ellis 's The Steam Man of the Prairies . [16] Several more modern works of art and fiction significant to the development of the genre were produced before the genre had a name. Titus Alone (1959), by Mervyn Peake , is widely regarded by scholars as the first novel in the genre proper, [17] [18] [19] while others point to Michael Moorcock 's 1971 novel The Warlord of the Air , [20] [21] [22] which was heavily influenced by Peake's work. The film Brazil (1985) was an early cinematic influence, although it can also be considered a precursor to the steampunk offshoot dieselpunk . [23] The Adventures of Luther Arkwright was an early (1970s) comic version of the Moorcock -style mover between timestreams . [24] [25] In fine art, Remedios Varo 's paintings combine elements of Victorian dress, fantasy, and technofantasy imagery. [26] [ page needed ] In television , one of the earliest manifestations of the steampunk ethos in the mainstream media was the CBS television series The Wild Wild West (1965\u201369), which inspired the later film . [16] [8] Although many works now considered seminal to the genre were published in the 1960s and 1970s, the term steampunk originated largely in the 1980s [27] as a tongue-in-cheek variant of cyberpunk . It was coined by science fiction author K. W. Jeter , [28] who was trying to find a general term for works by Tim Powers ( The Anubis Gates , 1983), James Blaylock ( Homunculus , 1986), and himself ( Morlock Night , 1979, and Infernal Devices , 1987) \u2014 all of which took place in a 19th-century (usually Victorian) setting and imitated conventions of such actual Victorian speculative fiction as H. G. Wells ' The Time Machine . In a letter to science fiction magazine Locus , [27] printed in the April 1987 issue, Jeter wrote: Dear Locus, Enclosed is a copy of my 1979 novel Morlock Night ; I'd appreciate your being so good as to route it to Faren Miller, as it's a prime piece of evidence in the great debate as to who in \"the Powers/Blaylock/Jeter fantasy triumvirate\" was writing in the \"gonzo-historical manner\" first. Though of course, I did find her review in the March Locus to be quite flattering. Personally, I think Victorian fantasies are going to be the next big thing, as long as we can come up with a fitting collective term for Powers, Blaylock and myself. Something based on the appropriate technology of the era; like \"steam-punks,\" perhaps.... While Jeter's Morlock Night and Infernal Devices , Powers' The Anubis Gates , and Blaylock's Lord Kelvin's Machine were the first novels to which Jeter's neologism would be applied, the three authors gave the term little thought at the time. [7] : 48 They were far from the first modern science fiction writers to speculate on the development of steam-based technology or alternative histories. Keith Laumer 's Worlds of the Imperium (1962) and Ronald W. Clark 's Queen Victoria's Bomb (1967) apply modern speculation to past-age technology and society. [31] [ page needed ] Michael Moorcock 's Warlord of the Air (1971) [22] is another early example. Harry Harrison 's novel A Transatlantic Tunnel, Hurrah! (1973) portrays Britain in an alternative 1973, full of atomic locomotives, coal-powered flying boats, ornate submarines, and Victorian dialogue. The Adventures of Luther Arkwright (mid-1970s) was one of the first steampunk comics. [ citation needed ] In February 1980, Richard A. Lupoff and Steve Stiles published the first \"chapter\" of their 10-part comic strip The Adventures of Professor Thintwhistle and His Incredible Aether Flyer . [32] In 2004, one anonymous author described steampunk as \"Colonizing the Past so we can dream the future.\" [33] The first use of the word \"steampunk\" in a title was in Paul Di Filippo 's 1995 Steampunk Trilogy , [22] consisting of three short novels: \"Victoria\", \"Hottentots\", and \"Walt and Emily\", which, respectively, imagine the replacement of Queen Victoria by a human/newt clone, an invasion of Massachusetts by Lovecraftian monsters, and a love affair between Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson . See also: Japanese cyberpunk Japanese steampunk consists of steampunk manga comics and anime productions from Japan. [12] Steampunk elements have consistently appeared in mainstream manga since the 1940s, dating back to Osamu Tezuka 's epic science-fiction trilogy consisting of Lost World (1948), Metropolis (1949) and Nextworld (1951). The steampunk elements found in manga eventually made their way into mainstream anime productions starting in the 1970s, including television shows such as Leiji Matsumoto 's Space Battleship Yamato (1974) and the 1979 anime adaptation of Riyoko Ikeda 's manga Rose of Versailles (1972). Influenced by 19th-century European authors such as Jules Verne, steampunk anime and manga arose from a Japanese fascination with an imaginary fantastical version of old Industrial Europe, linked to a phenomenon called akogare no Pari (\"the Paris of our dreams\"), comparable to the West 's fascination with an \"exotic\" East . [13] The most influential steampunk animator was Hayao Miyazaki , who was creating steampunk anime since the 1970s, starting with the television show Future Boy Conan (1978). [13] His manga Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (1982) and its 1984 anime film adaptation also contained steampunk elements. Miyazaki's most influential steampunk production was the Studio Ghibli anime film Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986), which became a major milestone in the genre and has been described by The Steampunk Bible as \"one of the first modern steampunk classics.\" [34] Archetypal steampunk elements in Laputa include airships , air pirates , steam-powered robots , and a view of steam power as a limitless but potentially dangerous source of power. [13] The success of Laputa inspired Hideaki Anno and Studio Gainax to create their first hit production, Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water (1990), a steampunk anime show which loosely adapts elements from Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea , with Captain Nemo making an appearance. [13] Based on a concept by Miyazaki, Nadia was influential on later steampunk anime such as Katsuhiro Otomo 's anime film Steamboy (2004). [35] Disney 's animated steampunk film Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001) [16] was influenced by anime, particularly Miyazaki's works and possibly Nadia . [36] [37] Other popular Japanese steampunk works include Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli anime films Porco Rosso (1992) [12] and Howl's Moving Castle (2004), [13] Sega 's video game and anime franchise Sakura Wars (1996) which is set in a steampunk version of Meiji / Taish\u014d era Japan, [13] and Square Enix 's manga and anime franchise Fullmetal Alchemist (2001). [12] Steampunk used to be confused with retrofuturism . [38] Indeed, both sensibilities recall \"the older but still modern eras in which technological change seemed to anticipate a better world, one remembered as relatively innocent of industrial decline.\" For some scholars, retrofuturism is considered a strand of steampunk, one that looks at alternatives to historical imagination and usually created with the same kinds of social protagonists and written for the same type of audiences. [39] One of steampunk's most significant contributions is the way in which it mixes digital media with traditional handmade art forms. As scholars Rachel Bowser and Brian Croxall put it, \"the tinkering and tinker-able technologies within steampunk invite us to roll up our sleeves and get to work re-shaping our contemporary world.\" [40] In this respect, steampunk bears more in common with DIY craft and making.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. ( March 2017 ) Many of the visualisations of steampunk have their origins with, among others, Walt Disney 's film 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954), [42] including the design of the story's submarine the Nautilus , its interiors, and the crew's underwater gear; and George Pal 's film The Time Machine (1960), especially the design of the time machine itself. This theme is also carried over to Six Flags Magic Mountain and Disney parks, in the themed area the \"Screampunk District\" at Six Flags Magic Mountain and in the designs of The Mysterious Island section of Tokyo DisneySea theme park and Disneyland Paris ' Discoveryland area. [ citation needed ] Aspects of steampunk design emphasise a balance between form and function. [43] In this it is like the Arts and Crafts Movement . But John Ruskin , William Morris , and the other reformers in the late nineteenth century rejected machines and industrial production. In contrast, steampunk enthusiasts present a \"non- luddite critique of technology\". [44] Various modern utilitarian objects have been modified by enthusiasts into a pseudo-Victorian mechanical \"steampunk\" style. [25] [45] Examples include computer keyboards and electric guitars . [46] The goal of such redesigns is to employ appropriate materials (such as polished brass, iron, wood, and leather) with design elements and craftsmanship consistent with the Victorian era, [22] [47] rejecting the aesthetic of industrial design . [43] In 1994, the Paris Metro station at Arts et M\u00e9tiers was redesigned by Belgian artist Francois Schuiten in steampunk style, to honor the works of Jules Verne. The station is reminiscent of a submarine, sheathed in brass with giant cogs in the ceiling and portholes that look out onto fanciful scenes. [48] [49] The artist group Kinetic Steam Works [50] brought a working steam engine to the Burning Man festival in 2006 and 2007. [51] The group's founding member, Sean Orlando, created a Steampunk Tree House (in association with a group of people who would later form the Five Ton Crane Arts Group [52] ) that has been displayed at a number of festivals. [53] [54] The Steampunk Tree House is now permanently installed at the Dogfish Head Brewery in Milton, Delaware . [55] The Neverwas Haul is a three-story, self-propelled mobile art vehicle built to resemble a Victorian house on wheels. Designed by Shannon O\u2019Hare, it was built by volunteers in 2006 and presented at the Burning Man festival from 2006 through 2015. [56] When fully built, the Haul propelled itself at a top speed of 5 miles per hour and required a crew of ten people to operate safely. Currently, the Neverwas Haul makes her home at Obtainium Works, an \"art car factory\" in Vallejo, CA owned by O\u2019Hare and home to several other self-styled \"contraptionists\". [57] In May\u2013June 2008, multimedia artist and sculptor Paul St George exhibited outdoor interactive video installations linking London and Brooklyn , New York, in a Victorian era-styled telectroscope . [58] [59] Utilizing this device, New York promoter Evelyn Kriete organised a transatlantic wave between steampunk enthusiasts from both cities, [60] prior to White Mischief's Around the World in 80 Days steampunk-themed event. [61] In 2009, for Questacon , artist Tim Wetherell created a large wall piece that represented the concept of the clockwork universe. This steel artwork contains moving gears, a working clock, and a movie of the moon's terminator in action. The 3D moon movie was created by Antony Williams. [62] Steampunk became a common descriptor for homemade objects sold on the craft network Etsy between 2009 and 2011, [63] though many of the objects and fashions bear little resemblance to earlier established descriptions of steampunk. Thus the craft network may not strike observers as \"sufficiently steampunk\" to warrant its use of the term. Comedian April Winchell , author of the book Regretsy: Where DIY meets WTF , cataloged some of the most egregious and humorous examples on her website \"Regretsy\". [64] The blog was popular among steampunks and even inspired a music video that went viral in the community and was acclaimed by steampunk \"notables\". [65] From October 2009 through February 2010, the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford , hosted the first major exhibition of steampunk art objects, curated and developed by New York artist and designer Art Donovan, [66] who also exhibited his own \"electro-futuristic\" lighting sculptures, and presented by Dr. Jim Bennett, museum director. [67] From redesigned practical items to fantastical contraptions, this exhibition showcased the work of eighteen steampunk artists from around the globe. The exhibit proved to be the most successful and highly attended in the museum's history and attracted more than eighty thousand visitors. The event was detailed in the official artist's journal The Art of Steampunk , by curator Donovan. [68] In November 2010, The Libratory Steampunk Art Gallery was opened by Damien McNamara in Oamaru, New Zealand . Created from papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 to resemble a large cave and filled with industrial equipment from yesteryear, rayguns , and general steampunk quirks, its purpose is to provide a place for steampunkers in the region to display artwork for sale all year long. A year later, a more permanent gallery, Steampunk HQ , was opened in the former Meeks Grain Elevator Building across the road from The Woolstore, and has since become a notable tourist attraction for Oamaru. [69] In 2012, the Mobilis in Mobili: An Exhibition of Steampunk Art and Appliance made its debut. Originally located at New York City's Wooster Street Social Club (itself the subject of the television series NY Ink ), the exhibit featured working steampunk tattoo systems designed by Bruce Rosenbaum, of ModVic and owner of the Steampunk House, [70] Joey \"Dr. Grymm\" Marsocci, [46] and Christopher Conte. [71] with different approaches. [42] \"[B]icycles, cell phones, guitars, timepieces and entertainment systems\" [71] rounded out the display. [46] The opening night exhibition featured a live performance by steampunk band Frenchy and the Punk . [72] The stills at The Oxford Artisan Distillery are nicknamed \" Nautilus \" and \" Nemo \", named after the submarine and its captain in the Jules Verne 1870 science fiction novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas . They were built in copper by South Devon Railway Engineering using a steampunk style. [73] Main article: Steampunk fashion Some of this section's listed sources may not be reliable . Please help this article by looking for better, more reliable sources. Unreliable citations may be challenged or deleted. ( November 2020 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Steampunk fashion has no set guidelines but tends to synthesize modern styles with influences from the Victorian era. Such influences may include bustles , corsets , gowns, and petticoats ; suits with waistcoats , coats, top hats [74] and bowler hats (themselves originating in 1850 England), tailcoats and spats ; or military-inspired garments. Steampunk-influenced outfits are usually accented with several technological and \"period\" accessories: timepieces, parasols , flying/driving goggles, [75] and ray guns. Modern accessories like cell phones or music players can be found in steampunk outfits, after being modified to give them the appearance of Victorian-era objects. Post-apocalyptic elements, such as gas masks, ragged clothing, and tribal motifs, can also be included. Aspects of steampunk fashion have been anticipated by mainstream high fashion, the Lolita and aristocrat styles, neo-Victorianism, and the Romantic Goth subculture . [24] [76] [77] In 2005, Kate Lambert , known as \"Kato\", founded the first steampunk clothing company, \"Steampunk Couture\", [78] mixing Victorian and post-apocalyptic influences. In 2013, IBM predicted, based on an analysis of more than a half million public posts on message boards, blogs, social media sites, and news sources, \"that 'steampunk,' a subgenre inspired by the clothing, technology and social mores of Victorian society, will be a major trend to bubble up and take hold of the retail industry\". [79] [80] Indeed, high fashion lines such as Prada , [81] Dolce & Gabbana , Versace , Chanel , [82] and Christian Dior [80] had already been introducing steampunk styles on the fashion runways. In episode 7 of Lifetime 's Under the Gunn reality series , contestants were challenged to create avant-garde \"steampunk chic\" looks. [83] America's Next Top Model tackled steampunk fashion in a 2012 episode where models competed in a steampunk-themed photo shoot, posing in front of a steam train while holding a live owl. [84] [ unreliable source ] The educational book Elementary BASIC \u2013 Learning to Program Your Computer in BASIC with Sherlock Holmes (1981), by Henry Singer and Andrew Ledgar , may have been the first fictional work to depict the use of Charles Babbage 's Analytical Engine in an adventure story. The instructional book, aimed at young programming students, depicts Holmes using the engine as an aid in his investigations, and lists programs that perform simple data processing tasks required to solve the fictional cases. The book even describes a device that allows the engine to be used remotely, over telegraph lines, as a possible enhancement to Babbage's machine. Companion volumes\u2014 Elementary Pascal \u2013 Learning to Program Your Computer in Pascal with Sherlock Holmes and From Baker Street to Binary \u2013 An Introduction to Computers and Computer Programming with Sherlock Holmes \u2014were also written. In 1988, the first version of the science fiction tabletop role-playing game Space: 1889 was published. The game is set in an alternative history in which certain now discredited Victorian scientific theories were probable and led to new technologies. Contributing authors included Frank Chadwick , Loren Wiseman , and Marcus Rowland . [85] William Gibson and Bruce Sterling 's novel The Difference Engine (1990) is often credited with bringing about widespread awareness of steampunk. [8] [86] This novel applies the principles of Gibson and Sterling's cyberpunk writings to an alternative Victorian era where Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage 's proposed steam-powered mechanical computer, which Babbage called a difference engine (a later, more general-purpose version was known as an Analytical Engine ), was actually built, and led to the dawn of the information age more than a century \"ahead of schedule\". This setting was different from most steampunk settings in that it takes a dim and dark view of this future, rather than the more prevalent utopian versions. Nick Gevers 's original anthology Extraordinary Engines (2008) features newer steampunk stories by some of the genre's writers, as well as other science fiction and fantasy writers experimenting with neo-Victorian conventions. A retrospective reprint anthology of steampunk fiction was released, also in 2008, by Tachyon Publications . Edited by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer and appropriately entitled Steampunk , it is a collection of stories by James Blaylock , whose \"Narbondo\" trilogy is typically considered steampunk; Jay Lake , author of the novel Mainspring , sometimes labeled \" clockpunk \"; [87] the aforementioned Michael Moorcock; as well as Jess Nevins , known for his annotations to The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (first published in 1999). Younger readers have also been targeted by steampunk themes, by authors such as Philip Reeve and Scott Westerfeld . [88] Reeve's quartet Mortal Engines is set far in Earth's future where giant moving cities consume each other in a battle for resources, a concept Reeve coined as Municipal Darwinism . Westerfeld's Leviathan trilogy is set during an alternate First World War fought between the \"clankers\" ( Central Powers ), who use steam technology, and \"darwinists\" ( Allied Powers ), who use genetically engineered creatures instead of machines. [89] \"Mash-ups\" are also becoming increasingly popular in books aimed at younger readers, mixing steampunk with other genres. Stefan Bachmann 's The Peculiar duology was labeled a \"steampunk fairytale,\" and imagines steampunk technology as a means to stave off an incursion of faeries in Victorian England. [90] Suzanne Lazear's Aether Chronicles series also mixes steampunk with faeries, and The Unnaturalists , by Tiffany Trent, combines steampunk with mythological creatures and alternate history. [91] While most of the original steampunk works had a historical setting, [ citation needed ] later works often place steampunk elements in a fantasy world with little relation to any specific historic era. Historical steampunk tends to be science fiction that presents an alternate history; it also contains real locales and persons from history with alternative fantasy technology. \"Fantasy-world steampunk\", such as China Mi\u00e9ville 's Perdido Street Station , Alan Campbell's Scar Night , and Stephen Hunt's Jackelian novels, on the other hand, presents steampunk in a completely imaginary fantasy realm , often populated by legendary creatures coexisting with steam-era and other anachronistic technologies. However, the works of China Mi\u00e9ville and similar authors are sometimes referred to as belonging to the \" New Weird \" rather than steampunk. [ citation needed ] Self-described author of \"far-fetched fiction\" Robert Rankin has incorporated elements of steampunk into narrative worlds that are both Victorian and re-imagined contemporary. In 2009, he was made a Fellow of the Victorian Steampunk Society. [92] The comic book series Hellboy , created by Mike Mignola , and the two Hellboy films featuring Ron Perlman and directed by Guillermo del Toro , all have steampunk elements. [93] In the comic book and the first (2004) film , Karl Ruprecht Kroenen is a Nazi SS scientist who has an addiction to having himself surgically altered, and who has many mechanical prostheses, including a clockwork heart. The character Johann Krauss is featured in the comic and in the second film, Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008), as an ectoplasmic medium (a gaseous form in a partly mechanical suit). This second film also features the Golden Army itself, which is a collection of 4,900 mechanical steampunk warriors. Since the 1990s, the application of the steampunk label has expanded beyond works set in recognisable historical periods, to works set in fantasy worlds that rely heavily on steam- or spring-powered technology. [8] One of the earliest short stories relying on steam-powered flying machines is \"The Aerial Burglar\" of 1844. [94] An example from juvenile fiction is The Edge Chronicles by Paul Stewart and Chris Riddell . One of the first steampunk novels set in a Middle-earth -like world was the Forest of Boland Light Railway by BB , about gnomes who build a steam locomotive . Fifty years later, Terry Pratchett wrote the Discworld novel Raising Steam , about the ongoing industrial revolution and railway mania in Ankh-Morpork . The gnomes and goblins in World of Warcraft also have technological societies that could be described as steampunk, [97] as they are vastly ahead of the technologies of men , but still run on steam and mechanical power. The Dwarves of the Elder Scrolls series , described therein as a race of Elves called the Dwemer , also use steam-powered machinery, with gigantic brass-like gears, throughout their underground cities. However, magical means are used to keep ancient devices in motion despite the Dwemer's ancient disappearance. [98] The 1998 game Thief: The Dark Project , as well as the other sequels including its 2014 reboot , feature heavy steampunk-inspired architecture, setting, and technology. Amidst the historical and fantasy subgenres of steampunk is a type that takes place in a hypothetical future or a fantasy equivalent of our future involving the domination of steampunk-style technology and aesthetics . Examples include Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro 's The City of Lost Children (1995), Turn A Gundam (1999\u20132000), Trigun , [99] and Disney's film Treasure Planet (2002). In 2011, musician Thomas Dolby heralded his return to music after a 20-year hiatus with an online steampunk alternate fantasy world called the Floating City, to promote his album A Map of the Floating City . [16] Another setting is \"Western\" steampunk, which overlaps with both the Weird West and Science fiction Western subgenres. One of the earliest steampunk books set in America was The Steam Man of the Prairies by Edward S. Ellis . Recent examples include the TV show and the movie adaption Wild Wild West , the Italian comics about Magico Vento , [100] Devon Monk 's Dead Iron , [101] and the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad in Disneyland -style Disney Parks around the world. [ citation needed ] See also: Cyberpunk derivatives Kaja Foglio introduced the term \"Gaslight Romance\", [7] : 78 gaslamp fantasy , which John Clute and John Grant define as \"steampunk stories ... most commonly set in a romanticised, smoky, 19th-century London, as are Gaslight Romances. But the latter category focuses nostalgically on icons from the late years of that century and the early years of the 20th century\u2014on Dracula , Jekyll and Hyde , Jack the Ripper , Sherlock Holmes and even Tarzan \u2014and can normally be understood as combining supernatural fiction and recursive fantasy , though some gaslight romances can be read as fantasies of history.\" [9] Author/artist James Richardson-Brown [102] coined the term steamgoth to refer to steampunk expressions of fantasy and horror with a \"darker\" bent. Mary Shelley 's The Last Man , set near the end of the 21st century after a plague had brought down civilization, was probably the ancestor of post-apocalyptic steampunk literature. Post-apocalyptic steampunk is set in a world where some cataclysm has precipitated the fall of civilization and steam power is once again ascendant, such as in Hayao Miyazaki 's post-apocalyptic anime Future Boy Conan (1978, loosely based on Alexander Key 's The Incredible Tide (1970)), [99] where a war fought with superweapons has devastated the planet. Robert Brown 's novel, The Wrath of Fate (as well as much of Abney Park 's music) is set in a Victorianesque world where an apocalypse was set into motion by a time-traveling mishap. Cherie Priest 's Boneshaker series is set in a world where a zombie apocalypse happened during the Civil War era. The Peshawar Lancers by S.M. Stirling is set in a post-apocalyptic future in which a meteor shower in 1878 caused the collapse of industrialized civilization. The movie 9 (which might be better classified as \"stitchpunk\" but was largely influenced by steampunk) [103] is also set in a post-apocalyptic world after a self-aware war machine ran amok. Steampunk Magazine even published a book called A Steampunk's Guide to the Apocalypse , about how steampunks could survive should such a thing actually happen. In general, this category includes any recent science fiction that takes place in a recognizable historical period (sometimes an alternate history version of an actual historical period) in which the Industrial Revolution has already begun, but electricity is not yet widespread, \"usually Britain of the early to mid-nineteenth century or the fantasized Wild West -era United States\", [104] with an emphasis on steam- or spring-propelled gadgets. The most common historical steampunk settings are the Victorian and Edwardian eras , though some in this \"Victorian steampunk\" category are set as early as the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and as late as the end of World War I . Some examples of this type include the novel The Difference Engine , [105] the comic book series League of Extraordinary Gentlemen , the Disney animated film Atlantis: The Lost Empire , [16] Scott Westerfeld 's Leviathan trilogy , [106] and the roleplaying game Space: 1889 . [16] The anime film Steamboy (2004) is another example of Victorian steampunk, taking place in an alternate 1866 where steam technology is far more advanced than reality. [107] Some, such as the comic series Girl Genius , [16] have their own unique times and places despite partaking heavily of the flavor of historic settings. Other comic series are set in a more familiar London, as in the Victorian Undead , which has Sherlock Holmes , Doctor Watson , and others taking on zombies, Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde , and Count Dracula , with advanced weapons and devices. Another example of this genre is the Tunnels novels by Roderick Gordon and Brian Williams. These are set in the modern day, but with an underground Victorian world that is working to overthrow the world above. Detective graphic novel series Lady Mechanika is set in an alternative Victorian-like world. Karel Zeman 's film The Fabulous World of Jules Verne (1958) is a very early example of cinematic steampunk. Based on Jules Verne novels, Zeman's film imagines a past that never was, based on those novels. [108] Other early examples of historical steampunk in cinema include Hayao Miyazaki 's anime films such as Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986) and Howl's Moving Castle (2004), which contain many archetypal anachronisms characteristic of the steampunk genre. [109] [110] \"Historical\" steampunk usually leans more towards science fiction than fantasy, but a number of historical steampunk stories have incorporated magical elements as well. For example, Morlock Night , written by K. W. Jeter , revolves around an attempt by the wizard Merlin to raise King Arthur to save the Britain of 1892 from an invasion of Morlocks from the future. [8] Paul Guinan 's Boilerplate , a \"biography\" of a robot in the late 19th century, began as a website that garnered international press coverage when people began believing that Photoshop images of the robot with historic personages were real. [111] The site was adapted into the illustrated hardbound book Boilerplate: History's Mechanical Marvel , which was published by Abrams in October 2009. [112] Because the story was not set in an alternative history, and in fact contained accurate information about the Victorian era, [113] some [ specify ] booksellers referred to the tome as \"historical steampunk\". Fictional settings inspired by East Asian rather than Western history, especially those inspired by Chinese history , have been called \"silkpunk\". The term originated with the author Ken Liu , [114] who defined it as \"a blend of science fiction and fantasy [that] draws inspiration from classical East Asian antiquity\", with a \"technology vocabulary (...) based on organic materials historically important to East Asia (bamboo, paper, silk) and seafaring cultures of the Pacific (coconut, feathers, coral)\", rather than the brass and leather associated with steampunk. Liu used the term to describe his Dandelion Dynasty series, which began in 2015. [115] Other works described as silkpunk include Neon Yang 's Tensorate series of novellas, which began in 2017. [116] Lyndsie Manusos of Book Riot has argued that the genre does \"not fit in a direct analogy with steampunk. Silkpunk is technology and poetics. It is engineering and language.\" [117] Steampunk music is very broadly defined. Abney Park 's lead singer Robert Brown defined it as \"mixing Victorian elements and modern elements\". There is a broad range of musical influences that make up the steampunk sound, from industrial dance and world music [77] to folk rock , dark cabaret to straightforward punk , [118] Carnatic [119] to industrial , hip-hop to opera (and even industrial hip-hop opera ), [120] [121] darkwave to progressive rock , barbershop to big band . Joshua Pfeiffer (of Vernian Process ) is quoted as saying, \"As for Paul Roland , if anyone deserves credit for spearheading Steampunk music, it is him. He was one of the inspirations I had in starting my project. He was writing songs about the first attempt at manned flight, and an Edwardian airship raid in the mid-80s long before almost anyone else ...\" [122] Thomas Dolby is also considered one of the early pioneers of retro-futurist (i.e., Steampunk and Dieselpunk) music. [123] [124] Amanda Palmer was once quoted as saying, \"Thomas Dolby is to Steampunk what Iggy Pop was to Punk !\" [125] Steampunk has also appeared in the work of musicians who do not specifically identify as steampunk. For example, the music video of \"Turn Me On\" , by David Guetta and featuring Nicki Minaj , takes place in a steampunk universe where Guetta creates human androids. Another music video is \" The Ballad of Mona Lisa \", by Panic! at the Disco , which has a distinct Victorian steampunk theme. A continuation of this theme has been used throughout the 2011 album Vices & Virtues , in the music videos, album art, and tour set and costumes. In addition, the album Clockwork Angels (2012) and its supporting tour by progressive rock band Rush contain lyrics, themes, and imagery based around steampunk. Similarly, Abney Park headlined the first \"Steamstock\" outdoor steampunk music festival in Richmond, California , which also featured Thomas Dolby , Frenchy and the Punk , Lee Presson and the Nails , Vernian Process , and others. [124] The music video for the Lindsey Stirling song \"Roundtable Rival\", has a Western steampunk setting. The Fabulous World of Jules Verne (1958) and The Fabulous Baron Munchausen (1962), both directed by Karel Zeman , have steampunk elements. The 1965 television series The Wild Wild West , as well as the 1999 film of the same name , features many elements of advanced steam-powered technology set in the Wild West time period of the United States. Two Years' Vacation (or The Stolen Airship ) (1967) directed by Karel Zeman contains steampunk elements. The BBC series Doctor Who also incorporates steampunk elements. Several storylines can be classed as steampunk, most notably The Evil of the Daleks (1966), wherein Victorian scientists invent a time travel device using mirrors and static electricity. [126] During season 14 of the show (in 1976), the formerly futuristic looking interior set was replaced with a Victorian -styled wood-panel and brass affair. [127] In the 1996 American co-production, the TARDIS interior was re-designed to resemble an almost Victorian library with the central control console made up of an eclectic array of anachronistic objects. Modified and streamlined for the 2005 revival of the series, the TARDIS console continued to incorporate steampunk elements, including a Victorian typewriter and gramophone , for many years. Dinner for Adele (1977) directed by Old\u0159ich Lipsk\u00fd involves steampunk contraptions. The 1979 film Time After Time has Herbert George \"H.G.\" Wells following a surgeon named John Leslie Stevenson into the future, as John is suspected of being Jack the Ripper . Both separately use Wells's time machine to travel. The Mysterious Castle in the Carpathians , (1981) directed by Old\u0159ich Lipsk\u00fd , contains steampunk elements. [128] The 1982 American TV series Q.E.D. is set in Edwardian England, stars Sam Waterston as Professor Quentin Everett Deverill (from whose initials, by which he is primarily known, the series title is derived, initials which also stand for the Latin phrase quod erat demonstrandum , which translates as \"which was to be demonstrated\"). The Professor is an inventor and scientific detective, in the mold of Sherlock Holmes . The plot of the Soviet film Kin-dza-dza! (1986) centers on a desert planet , depleted of its resources, where an impoverished dog-eat-dog society uses steampunk machines, the movements and functions of which defy Earthly logic. In making his 1986 Japanese film Castle in the Sky , Hayao Miyazaki was heavily influenced by steampunk culture, the film featuring various airships and steampowered contraptions as well as a mysterious island that floats through the sky, accomplished not through magic as in most stories, but instead by harnessing the physical properties of a rare crystal\u2014analogous to the lodestone used in the Laputa of Swift's Gulliver's Travels \u2014augmented by massive propellers, as befitting the Victorian motif. [129] The first \"Wallace & Gromit\" animation \" A Grand Day Out \" (1989) features a space rocket in the steampunk style. [ citation needed ] The second half of Back to the Future III (1990) gradually evolves into steampunk. The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. , a 1993 Fox Network TV science fiction-Western set in the 1890s, features elements of steampunk as represented by the character Professor Wickwire, whose inventions were described as \"the coming thing\". [130] The short-lived 1995 TV show Legend , on UPN , set in 1876 Arizona , features such classic inventions as a steam-driven \"quadrovelocipede\", trigoggle and night-vision goggles (\u00e0 la teslapunk), and stars John de Lancie as a thinly disguised Nikola Tesla . [ citation needed ] Steamboy (2004) is a Japanese animated action film directed and co-written by Katsuhiro Otomo ( Akira ). It is a retro science-fiction epic set in a steampunk Victorian England. It features steamboats, trains, airships and inventors. The 2004 film Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events contains steampunk-esque elements such as costumes and vehicle interiors. The 2007 Syfy miniseries Tin Man incorporates a considerable number of steampunk-inspired themes into a reimagining of L. Frank Baum 's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz . Despite leaning more towards Gothic influences, the \"parallel reality\" of Meanwhile, City, within the 2009 film Franklyn contains many steampunk themes, such as costumery, architecture, minimal use of electricity (with a preference for gaslight), and absence of modern technology (such as there being no motorised vehicles or advanced weaponry, and the manual management of information without computers). The 2009\u20132014 Syfy television series Warehouse 13 features many steampunk-inspired objects and artifacts, including computer designs created by steampunk artisan Richard Nagy, a.k.a. \"Datamancer\". [131] The 2010 episode of the TV series Castle entitled \"Punked\" (which first aired on October 11, 2010) prominently features the steampunk subculture and uses Los Angeles -area steampunks (such as the League of STEAM ) as extras. The 2011 film The Three Musketeers has many steampunk elements, including gadgets and airships. The Legend of Korra , a 2012\u20132014 Nickelodeon animated series, incorporates steampunk elements in an industrialized world with East Asian themes. The Penny Dreadful (2014) television series is a Gothic Victorian fantasy series with steampunk props and costumes. The 2015 GSN reality television game show Steampunk'd features a competition to create steampunk-inspired art and designs which are judged by notable steampunks Thomas Willeford , Kato , and Matthew Yang King (as Matt King). [132] Based on the work of cartoonist Jacques Tardi , April and the Extraordinary World (2015) is an animated movie set in a steampunk Paris. It features airships, trains, submarines, and various other steam-powered contraptions. Tim Burton 's 2016 film Alice Through the Looking Glass features steampunk costumes, props, and vehicles. Japanese anime Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress (2016) features a steampunk zombie apocalypse. The American fantasy animated sitcom , Disenchantment , created by Matt Groening for Netflix , features a steampunk country named Steamland, led by an odd industrialist named Alva Gunderson voiced by Richard Ayoade , first appears in the season 1 episode, \"The Electric Princess.\" [133] [134] [a] The country is portrayed as driven by logic and is egalitarian , governed by science, rather than magic, as is the case for Dreamland, where the protagonist, Princess Bean , is from. [135] The country has cars, automatic lights, submarines, and other modern technologies, all of which are steam-powered, and references to Groening's other series, Futurama . [136] [137] Steamland appears in three episodes of the show's second season, [b] showing an explorers club as part of the country's high society , flying zeppelins , and robots with light bulbs for heads that chase the protagonists through the streets. [138] [139] Some even argued that Steamland is \" dieselpunk -inspired.\" [140] A variety of styles of video games have used steampunk settings. Steel Empire (1992), a shoot 'em up game originally released as Koutetsu Teikoku on the Sega Mega Drive console in Japan, is considered to be the first steampunk video game. Designed by Yoshinori Satake and inspired by Hayao Miyazaki 's anime film Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986), Steel Empire is set in an alternate timeline dominated by steam-powered technology. The commercial success of Steel Empire , both in Japan and the West, helped propel steampunk into the video game market , and had a significant influence on later steampunk games. The most notable steampunk game it influenced is Final Fantasy VI (1994), a Japanese role-playing game developed by Squaresoft and designed by Hiroyuki Ito for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System . Final Fantasy VI was both critically and commercially successful, and had a considerable influence on later steampunk video games. [35] The Chaos Engine (1993) is a run and gun video game inspired by the Gibson/Sterling novel The Difference Engine (1990), set in a Victorian steampunk age. Developed by the Bitmap Brothers , it was first released on the Amiga in 1993; a sequel was released in 1996. [141] The graphic adventure puzzle video games Myst (1993), Riven (1997), Myst III: Exile (2001), and Myst IV: Revelation (all produced by or under the supervision of Cyan Worlds ) take place in an alternate steampunk universe, where elaborate infrastructures have been built to run on steam power. The Elder Scrolls (since 1994, last release in 2014) is an action role-playing game where one can find an ancient extinct race called dwemers or dwarves, whose steampunk technology is based on steam-powered levers and gears made of copper-bronze material, which are maintained by magical techniques that have kept them in working order over the centuries. Sakura Wars (1996), a visual novel and tactical role-playing game developed by Sega for the Saturn console, is set in a steampunk version of Japan during the Meiji and Taish\u014d periods, and features steam-powered mecha robots. [12] Thief: The Dark Project (1998), its sequels, Thief II (2000), Thief: Deadly Shadows (2004) and its reboot Thief (2014) are set in a steampunk metropolis. The 2001 computer role-playing game Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura mixed fantasy tropes with steampunk.

Solatorobo (2010) is a role-playing video game developed by CyberConnect2 set in a floating island archipelago populated by anthropomorphic cats and dogs, who pilot steampunk airships and engage in combat with robots. Resonance of Fate (2010) is a role-playing video game developed by tri-Ace and published by Sega for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 . It is set in a steampunk environment with combat involving guns. Impossible Creatures (2003) real-time strategy game inspired by the works of H. G. Welles , especially \" The Island of Doctor Moreau \". Developed by Relic Entertainment , it sees an adventurer building an army of genetically spliced animals to battle against a mad scientist who has abducted his father. The player's headquarters is a steam-powered \"Hovertrain\" locomotive , which functions as both a science lab and mobile command center.

You can help by . ( August 2020 ) Mattel's Monster High dolls Robecca Steam and Hexiciah Steam. The Pullip Dolls by Japanese manufacturer Dal have a steampunk range. Hornby 's world of Bassett-Lowke steampunk models Because of the popularity of steampunk, there is a growing movement of adults that want to establish steampunk as a culture and lifestyle. [145] Some fans of the genre adopt a steampunk aesthetic through fashion, [146] home decor, music, and film. While Steampunk is considered the amalgamation of Victorian aesthetic principles with modern sensibilities and technologies, [24] it can be more broadly categorised as neo-Victorianism , described by scholar Marie-Luise Kohlke as \"the afterlife of the nineteenth century in the cultural imaginary\". [147] The subculture has its own magazine, blogs, and online shops. [148] In September 2012, a panel, chaired by steampunk entertainer Veronique Chevalier and with panelists including magician Pop Hadyn and members of the steampunk performance group the League of STEAM , was held at Stan Lee 's Comikaze Expo . The panel suggested that because steampunk was inclusive of and incorporated ideas from various other subcultures such as goth, neo-Victorian, and cyberpunk, as well as a growing number of fandoms , it was fast becoming a super-culture rather than a mere subculture. [149] Other steampunk notables such as Professor Elemental have expressed similar views about steampunk's inclusive diversity. [150] Some have proposed a steampunk philosophy that incorporates punk-inspired anti-establishment sentiments typically bolstered by optimism about human potential. [151] A 2004 Steampunk Manifesto , later republished in SteamPunk Magazine , lamented that most \"so-called\" steampunk was nothing more than dressed-up recreationary nostalgia and proposed that \"authentic\" steampunk would \"take the levers of technology from the [technocrats] and powerful.\" [152] American activist and performer Miriam Rosenberg Rocek impersonated anarcha-feminist Emma Goldman to inspire discussions around gender, society and politics. [4] SteamPunk Magazine was edited and published by anarchists. Its founder, Margaret Killjoy , argued \"there have always been radical politics at the core of steampunk.\" [153] Diana M. Pho, a science-fiction editor and author of the multicultural steampunk blog Beyond Victoriana , similarly argued steampunk's \" progressive roots\" can be traced to its literary inspirations, including Verne's Captain Nemo . [154] Steampunk authors Phenderson Dj\u00e8l\u00ed Clark , [155] Jaymee Goh, [156] Dru Pagliassotti , [157] and Charlie Stross [158] consider their work political. These views are not universally shared. [76] Killjoy lamented that even some diehard enthusiasts believe steampunk \"has nothing to offer but designer clothes.\" [153] Pho argued many steampunk fans \"don't like to acknowledge that their attitudes could be considered ideological.\" [154] The largest online steampunk community, Brass Goggles , which is dedicated to what it calls the \"lighter side\" of steampunk, banned discussion about politics. Cory Gross, who was one of the first to write about the history and theory of steampunk, argued that the \"sepia-toned yesteryear more appropriate for Disney and grandparents than a vibrant and viable philosophy or culture\" denounced in the Steampunk Manifesto [152] was in fact representative of the genre. [159] Author Catherynne M. Valente called the punk in steampunk \"nearly meaningless.\" [160] Kate Franklin and James Schafer, who at the time managed one of the largest steampunk groups on Facebook , admitted in 2011 that steampunk hadn't created the \"revolutionary, or even a particularly progressive\" community they wanted. [161] Blogger and podcaster Eric Renderking Fisk announced in 2017 that steampunk was no longer punk, since it had \"lost the anti-authoritarian, anti-establishment aspects.\" [162] Others argued explicitly against turning steampunk into a political movement, [163] preferring to see steampunk as \"escapism\" [164] or a \"fandom\". [165] In 2018, Nick Ottens, editor of the online alternate-history magazine Never Was , declared that the \"lighter side\" of steampunk had won out. [166] To the extent that steampunk is politicized , it appears to be an American and British phenomenon. Continental Europeans [167] and Latin Americans [168] are more likely to consider steampunk a hobby than a cause. June 19, 2005 marked the grand opening of the world's first steampunk club night, \"Malediction Society\", in Los Angeles . [169] [170] The event ran for nearly 12 years at The Monte Cristo nightclub, interrupted by a single year residency at Argyle Hollywood, until both the club night and The Monte Cristo closed in April 2017. [170] Though the steampunk aesthetic eventually gave way to a more generic goth and industrial aesthetic, Malediction Society celebrated its roots every year with \"The Steampunk Ball\". [171] 2006 saw the first \"SalonCon\", a neo-Victorian/steampunk convention. It ran for three consecutive years and featured artists, musicians ( Voltaire and Abney Park), authors ( Catherynne M. Valente , Ekaterina Sedia , and G. D. Falksen ), salons led by people prominent in their respective fields, workshops and panels on steampunk\u2014as well as a seance, ballroom dance instruction, and the Chrononauts' Parade. The event was covered by MTV [172] and The New York Times . [24] Since then, a number of popular steampunk conventions have sprung up the world over, with names like Steamcon ( Seattle ), the Steampunk World's Fair ( Piscataway, New Jersey ), Up in the Aether: The Steampunk Convention ( Dearborn, Michigan ), [173] Steampunk NZ ( Oamaru, New Zealand ), Steampunk Unlimited ( Strasburg Railroad , Lancaster, PA ). [174] Each year, on Mother's Day weekend, the city of Waltham, MA , turns over its city center and surrounding areas to host the Watch City Steampunk Festival , a US outdoor steampunk festival. In Kennebunk, ME the Brick Store Museum hosts the Southern Maine Steampunk Fair annually. [175] [176] During the first weekend of May, the Australian town of Nimmitabel celebrates Steampunk @ Altitude with some 2,000 attendance. [177] In recent years, steampunk has also become a regular feature at San Diego Comic-Con International , with the Saturday of the four-day event being generally known among steampunks as \"Steampunk Day\", and culminating with a photo-shoot for the local press. [178] [179] In 2010, this was recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's largest steampunk photo shoot. [180] In 2013, Comic-Con announced four official 2013 T-shirts, one of them featuring the official Rick Geary Comic-Con toucan mascot in steampunk attire. [181] The Saturday steampunk \"after-party\" has also become a major event on the steampunk social calendar: in 2010, the headliners included The Slow Poisoner, Unextraordinary Gentlemen, and Voltaire, with Veronique Chevalier as Mistress of Ceremonies and special appearance by the League of STEAM ; [182] [183] in 2011, UXG returned with Abney Park. [184] Steampunk has also sprung up recently at Renaissance Festivals and Renaissance Faires , in the US. Some festivals have organised events or a \"Steampunk Day\", while others simply support an open environment for donning steampunk attire. The Bristol Renaissance Faire in Kenosha, Wisconsin , on the Wisconsin / Illinois border, featured a Steampunk costume contest during the 2012 season, the previous two seasons having seen increasing participation in the phenomenon. [185] Steampunk also has a growing following in the UK and Europe. The largest European event is \" Weekend at the Asylum \", held at The Lawn, Lincoln , every September since 2009. Organised as a not-for-profit event by the Victorian Steampunk Society, the Asylum is a dedicated steampunk event which takes over much of the historical quarter of Lincoln, England , along with Lincoln Castle . In 2011, there were over 1000 steampunks in attendance. The event features the Empire Ball, Majors Review, Bazaar Eclectica, and the international Tea Duelling final. [186] [187] The Surrey Steampunk Convivial was originally held in New Malden , but since 2019 has been held in Stoneleigh in southwestern London, within walking distance of H. G. Wells 's home. [188] The Surrey Steampunk Convivial started as an annual event in 2012, and now takes place thrice a year, and has spanned three boroughs and five venues. [189] Attendees have been interviewed by BBC Radio 4 for Phill Jupitus [190] and filmed by the BBC World Service . [191] The West Yorkshire village of Haworth has held an annual Steampunk weekend since 2013, [192] on each occasion as a charity event raising funds for Sue Ryder's \"Manorlands\" hospice in Oxenhope . In September 2021, Finland 's first steampunk festival was held at the V\u00e4in\u00f6 Linna Square and the Werstas Workers' House in Tampere , Pirkanmaa , Finland. [193] [194] A 2018 physics Ph.D. dissertation used the phrase \"Quantum Steampunk\" to describe the author's synthesis of some 19th century and current ideas. [195] [196] The term has not been widely adopted. A 2012 conference paper on human factors in computing systems examines the use of steampunk as a design fiction for human-computer interaction (HCI). It concludes that \"the practices of DIY and appropriation that are evident in Steampunk design provide a useful set of design strategies and implications for HCI\". [197] Steampunk HQ , a museum and arts centre dedicated to steampunk in Oamaru , New Zealand , along with its associated art gallery ( The Libratory ), was the world's first steampunk museum. The town of Oamaru and the English city of Lincoln have both claimed the title of \"Steampunk Capital of the World\".

Marler | Dec 3, 2018 M ost people recognize the distinctive visual iconography of steampunk, which has made steady inroads into film, television, and music videos since the late 1990s. Gears, goggles, vests, corsets\u2014these and many other modified and imagined brass gadgets are among the sepia-toned hallmarks of what some have called \u201cneo-Victorian futurism.\u201d Kathryn M. Weaver. But steampunk also has a wider countercultural presence. Steampunk literature has grown so vast that it has developed its own subgenres, from alternate histories and social commentary to graphic novels and erotica. There are steampunk bands, and steampunk conventions draw thousands of people annually to far-flung cultural centers such as Atlanta and Seattle, as well as to less likely locales such as Bloomington, Indiana, and Lafayette, Louisiana. Steampunk also has an international footprint\u2014the French, in particular, have a thriving steampunk community, including a theme park in Nantes. Steampunk can figure as literary trope, DIY craft, or mainstream fashion. Moreover, besides its striking visual characteristics, we might also consider steampunk a novel and popular way of \u201cdoing\u201d history. Those who sneer at steampunk often emphasize the moment when the corporate mainstream temporarily commodified the movement\u2019s aesthetic. Defining steampunk is difficult, however, eluding even committed practitioners. To some, it is primarily an underground movement, perhaps with anarchist leanings (hence, the \u201cpunk\u201d in steampunk). Detractors often dismiss it as an ephemeral consumer trend. American studies scholar Rebecca Onion has referred to steampunk as a \u201c multitextual aesthetic ,\u201d an empty mold into which any number of things can be poured, depending on the purposes and ideologies of those who employ it. For many of its subcultural advocates, steampunk\u2019s shrewd juxtapositions of disparate historical contexts with speculative or adapted technologies serve as \u201cethical spectacles\u201d that represent resistance and transgression in the present. In this way, studded leather corsets worn on the outside of steampunk women\u2019s clothing become weaponized assertions of self-assured sexuality even as they also allude subversively to the garment\u2019s literal imprisonment of bourgeois women\u2019s bodies during the 19th century. The Grand Elephant at the steampunk park Les Machines de l\u2019\u00eele, Nantes, France. ___jeff/Flickr/CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 Steampunk has its critics, ironically including some of its literary paragons. This adds to the problem of defining the movement satisfactorily. Even William Gibson\u2014co-author of The Difference Engine (1990), a dystopian alternate transnational history of the Victorian era\u2014has evinced skepticism about the nature of the genre. \u201cSteampunk strikes me as the least angry quasi-bohemian manifestation I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he has said. \u201cThere\u2019s no scary steampunk.\u201d Yet Gibson\u2019s novel, widely acknowledged as a foundational steampunk text, ends with a mechanical (not digital) computer achieving sinister sentience as a social panopticon. Similarly, China Mi\u00e9ville\u2019s Perdido Street Station (2000), which many consider to be the quintessential steampunk novel, takes place in the horrifying Dickensian city of New Crobuzon, a thinly disguised 19th-century London. However, Mi\u00e9ville himself insists he had only a vague notion of what steampunk was when he wrote it, and he politely distances himself from its categorization as such. Steampunk\u2019s lengthy history might help to characterize it. Jules Verne and H. G. Wells are commonly cited as its earliest progenitors, but its name comes from a letter that novelist K. W. Jeter wrote to Locus in 1987. This demarcates the \u201cfirst wave\u201d of American steampunk. During the 1990s, it remained a tiny fanboy culture based mainly in science fiction and graphic novels. The far more interesting \u201csecond wave\u201d of steampunk, especially the emergence of a countercultural community, began around 2006\u2014perhaps not coincidentally, soon after the appearance of the iPhone, a now-ubiquitous device that typifies the opaque, inaccessible, and depersonalized nature of today\u2019s consumer technologies. By 2013, an IBM study based on quantitative and demographic analysis of social media posited that steampunk was the \u201cnext big thing.\u201d Around the same time, pop star Justin Bieber co-opted steampunk style for a Christmas music video, and a national Prada campaign featured celebrities like Willem Dafoe in steampunk-inspired garb. Those who sneer at steampunk often flatten out its history and emphasize this moment, when the corporate mainstream temporarily rebranded the movement and commodified its aesthetic. But this attempted \u201cconquest of cool\u201d did not last long. Jaymee Goh and Diana M. Pho at the Steampunk World\u2019s Fair. Margaret Killjoy/Flickr/CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 Studded leather corsets worn on the outside of steampunk women\u2019s clothing become weaponized assertions of self-assured sexuality. In \u201csecond wave\u201d steampunk, its literary manifestations (such as Cherie Priest\u2019s popular Clockwork Century series) became less important than the artisanal ethos that is the backbone of the movement today. Far more than a niche genre of science fiction, steampunk is now a decidedly material culture. Its fashions echo Romanticism\u2019s late 19th-century heirs, the unconventional dandy aesthetes epitomized by Oscar Wilde (a socialist who once quipped that \u201cthe one duty we owe to history is to rewrite it\u201d). Self-fashioning cosplay and the corollary creation of steampunk personas (\u201csteamsonas\u201d) constitute the core of the subculture\u2019s performative nature. In Diana M. Pho\u2019s words, steampunks use elaborate costumes, prosthetics, and other accessories to become \u201c performing cyborgs \u201d\u2014beings whose lived aesthetics literally embody political critiques. Pho herself , Jaymee Goh, and Steampunk Emma Goldman (Miriam Ro\u010dek) are a few of the women, often predominant in steampunk communities, who have actively embraced these performative aspects of steampunk\u2019s \u201c ideology of style \u201d in oppositional public contexts like Occupy Wall Street. Along with clothing, thousands of second-wave \u201cmakers\u201d around the world (as evidenced on Etsy.com) create jewelry, accoutrements, and a wide variety of gadgets, especially through the antiquing\u2014or \u201cmodding\u201d (modifying)\u2014of disposable, mass-produced goods, such as Jake von Slatt\u2019s famous steampunked desktop computer. Objects like these highlight how steampunk\u2019s relationship to the postindustrial world exhibits some parallels with the politically tinged Arts and Crafts movement\u2019s relationship to the Industrial Revolution. But, as the founders of Steampunk Magazine insisted, this DIY ethos is not a \u201creactionary, dressed up nostalgia.\u201d It is instead a form of protest against the closed nature of dominant postindustrial technologies with cold, sterile designs that evade nonspecialist comprehension and that decidedly exclude tinkering.

toilet . People may choose fields, bushes, forests, ditches, streets, canals, or other open spaces for defecation. They do so either because they do not have a toilet readily accessible or due to traditional cultural practices. [2] The practice is common where sanitation infrastructure and services are not available. Even if toilets are available, behavior change efforts may still be needed to promote the use of toilets. 'Open defecation free' (ODF) is a term used to describe communities that have shifted to using toilets instead of open defecation. This can happen, for example, after community-led total sanitation programs have been implemented.\nOpen defecation can pollute the environment and cause health problems and diseases. High levels of open defecation are linked to high child mortality , poor nutrition , poverty , and large disparities between rich and poor. [3] : 11 Ending open defecation is an indicator being used to measure progress towards the Sustainable Development Goal Number 6 . Extreme poverty and lack of sanitation are statistically linked. Therefore, eliminating open defecation is thought to be an important part of the effort to eliminate poverty. [4]\nAs of 2019 an estimated 673 million people practice open defecation, [5] : 74 down from about 892 million people (12 percent of the global population) in 2016. [6] In that year, 76 percent (678 million) of the people practicing open defecation in the world lived in just seven countries. [6]\nIn ancient times, there were more open spaces and less population pressure on land. It was believed that defecating in the open causes little harm when done in areas with low population, forests, or camping-type situations. With development and urbanization, open defecating started becoming a challenge and thereby an important public health issue, and an issue of human dignity . [7] With the increase in population in smaller areas, such as cities and towns, more attention was given to hygiene and health. As a result, there was an increase in global attention towards reducing the practice of open defecation. [8]\nOpen defecation perpetuates the vicious cycle of disease and poverty and is widely regarded as an affront to personal dignity. [3] The countries where open defecation is most widely practiced have the highest numbers of deaths of children under the age of five, as well as high levels of undernutrition , high levels of poverty, and large disparities between people of means and the poor.

This was due to the publications by the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) and the UN International Year of Sanitation . The JMP is a joint program by WHO and UNICEF that was earlier tasked to monitor the water and sanitation targets of the Millennium development goals (MDGs); it is now tasked to monitor Sustainable Development Goal Number 6 .\nFor monitoring of the MDG Number 7, two categories were created: 1) improved sanitation and (2) unimproved sanitation . Open defecation falls into the category of unimproved sanitation. This means that people who practice open defecation do not have access to improved sanitation.\nIn 2013 World Toilet Day was celebrated as an official UN day for the first time. The term \"open defecation\" was used in high-level speeches, that helped to draw global attention to this issue (for example, in the \"call to action\" on sanitation issued by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations in March 2013). [9]\n\"Open defecation free\" (ODF) is a phrase first used in community-led total sanitation (CLTS) programs. ODF has now entered use in other contexts. The original meaning of ODF stated that all community members are using sanitation facilities (such as toilets) instead of going to the open for defecation. This definition was improved and more criteria were added in some countries that have adopted the CLTS approach in their programs to stop the practice of open defecation. [10]\nThe Indian Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation in mid-2015 defined ODF as \"the termination of fecal-oral transmission , defined by:\n- No visible feces found in the environment or village and\n- Every household as well as public/community institutions using safe technology option for disposal of feces\". [11]\nHere, a \"safe technology option\" means a toilet that contains feces so that there is no contamination of surface soil, groundwater or surface water ; flies or animals do not come in contact with the open feces; no one handles excreta; there is no smell and there are no visible feces around in the environment. [12] This definition is part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Campaign).\nThe reasons for open defecation are varied. It can be a voluntary, semi-voluntary or involuntary choice. Most of the time, a lack of access to a toilet is the reason. However, in some places even people with toilets in their houses prefer to defecate in the open. [10]\nA few broad factors that result in the practice of open defecation are listed below.\n- Lack of infrastructure: People often lack toilets in their houses, or in the areas where they live. [5] [13]\n- Lack of toilets in other places: Lack of toilets in places away from people's houses, such as in schools or in the farms leads the people to defecate in the open. [13] Another example is a lack of public toilets in cities, whether by a reluctance among businesses to allow patrons to use their toilets or limited hours (e.g. if there are no 24-hour businesses in town and someone needs to use the toilet after regular business hours), which can be a big problem for homeless people . [14]\n- Use of toilets for other purposes: In some rural communities, toilets are used for other purposes, such as storing household items, animals, farm products or used as kitchens. In such cases, people go outside to defecate. [15] [16]\n- Poor quality of toilet: Sometimes people have access to a toilet, but the toilet might be broken, or of poor quality \u2013 outdoor toilets (pit latrines in particular) typically are devoid of any type of cleaning and reek of odors. Sometimes, toilets are not well lit at all times, especially in areas that lack electricity. Others lack doors or may not have water. Toilets with maggots or cockroaches are also disliked by people and hence, they go out to defecate. [17] [18] [19] [13]\n- Risky and unsafe: Some toilets are risky to access. There may be a risk to personal safety due to lack of lights at night, criminals around them, or the presence of animals such as snakes and dogs. Women and children who do not have toilets inside their houses are often found to be scared to access shared or public toilets, especially at night. [19] [20] Accessing toilets that are not located in the house might be a problem for disabled people, especially at night. [21] In some parts of the world, Zambia for example, very young children are discouraged from using pit latines due to the risk of them falling through the open drop-hole. In such cases when there is no other available sanitation facility, children are encouraged to practice open defecation. [22]\n- Presence of toilet but not privacy: Some toilets do not have a real door, but have a cloth hung as a door. In some communities, toilets are located in places where women are shy to access them due to the presence of men. [23] [21] [13]\n- Lack of water near toilet: Absence of supply of water inside or next to toilets cause people to get water from a distance before using the toilet. [13] This is an additional task and needs extra time.\n- Too many people using a toilet: This is especially true in the case of shared or public toilets. If too many people want to use a toilet at the same time, then some people may go outside to defecate instead of waiting. In some cases, people might not be able to wait due to diarrhea (or the result of an Inflammatory Bowel Disease emergency).\n- Fear of the pit getting filled: In some places, people are scared that their toilet pits will get filled very fast if all family members use them every day. So they continue to go out to delay the toilet pit filling up. This is especially true in the case of a pit latrine. [19] [21]\n- Lack of awareness: People in some communities do not know about the benefits of using toilets. [24] [25]\n- Lack of behavior change : Some communities have toilets, yet people prefer to defecate in the open. [10] In some cases, these toilets are provided by the government or other organizations and the people do not like them, or do not value them. They continue to defecate in the open. Also, older people are often found to defecate in the open and they are hesitant to change their behavior and go inside a closed toilet. [13]\n- Prefer being in nature: This happens mostly in less populated or rural areas, where people walk outside early in the morning and go to defecate in the fields or bushes. They prefer to be in nature and the fresh air; instead of defecating in a closed space such as a toilet. [4] There may be a cultural or habitual preference for defecating \"in the open air\", beside a local river or stream, or even the bush.\n- Combining open defecation with other activities: Some people walk early in the morning to look after their farms. Some consider it a social activity, especially women who like to take some time to go out of their homes. While on their way to the fields for open defecation they can talk to other women and take care of their animals. [13]\n- Social norms : Open defecation is a part of people's life and daily habits in some regions. For instance, a 2011 survey in rural East Java , Indonesia, found that many men considered the practice \u2018normal\u2019, and having distinct benefits such as social interaction and physical comfort. [26] In some cultures, there may be social taboos where a father-in-law may not use the same toilet as a daughter-in-law in the same household. [ citation needed ]\n- Social or personal preferences: Open defecation is a preferred practice in some parts of the world, with many respondents in a survey from 2015 stating that \"open defecation was more pleasurable and desirable than latrine use\". [26]\n- In some societies, open defecation is an intentional means of fertilization which is widely-used.\n- Fecal incontinence : This medical condition can result in abrupt 'emergencies' and not enough time to access a toilet.\nIn developed countries , open defecation can be due to homelessness . Open defecation in developed areas is also considered to be a part of recreational outdoor activities such as camping in remote areas. It is difficult to estimate how many people practice open defecation in these communities.\nThe practice of open defecation is strongly related to poverty and exclusion particularly, in the case of rural areas and informal urban settlements in developing countries . The Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) of UNICEF and WHO has been collecting data regarding open defecation prevalence worldwide. The figures are segregated by rural and urban areas and by levels of poverty. This program is tasked to monitor progress towards the millennium development goal (MDG) relating to drinking water and sanitation. As open defecation is one example of unimproved sanitation , it is being monitored by JMP for each country, and results are published on a regular basis. [28] [6] The figures on open defecation used to be lumped together with other figures on unimproved sanitation but are collected separately since 2010.\nThe current estimate is that around 673 million people practice open defecation. [5] : 74\nThe number of people practicing open defecation fell from 20 percent in 2000 to 12 percent in 2015. [6] : 34 In 2016, the estimate was for 892 million people with no sanitation facility whatsoever and therefore practicing open defecation (in gutters, behind bushes, in open water bodies, etc.). Most people (9 of 10) who practice open defecation live in rural areas, but the vast majority lives in two regions ( Central Africa and South Asia ). [6] In 2016, seventy-six percent (678 million) of the 892 million people practicing open defecation in the world lived in just seven countries. [6]\nSome countries with large numbers of people who openly defecate are listed in the table below.\n|Country||Total population||Percentage and Number of people who defecate in the open||Other estimates (based on government-provided data or other sources)|\n|Cambodia||16,949,415||17% or 2.8 million (2021) [29]|\n|Chad||16,244,513||69% or 11 million (2018) [30]|\n|China||1,411,778,724||1% or ~13 million (2018)|\n|Eritrea||5,228,000||76% or 4 million (2017)|\n|Ethiopia||117,876,227||18% or 20.1 million (2020) [31]|\n|India||1,352,642,280|\n15% or ~209.4 million(World Bank 2020) [32] 48% or 594 million(according to UNICEF) [33]\nThe National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey of India reported that 96.5% of rural households in India had toilets.

Globally, India has the largest number of people, close to 594 million which is 48% of Indians practise open defecation. [44] About half the population of India use toilets. [45] With 44 per cent of mothers disposing their children\u2019s faeces in the open, there is a very high risk of microbial contamination (bacteria, viruses, amoeba) of water which causes diarrhea in children. [46] Although access to sanitation in rural India is improving, the increase is not equitable. Open defecation is still almost universal among the poorest 20% of India. [47] A report published by WaterAid stated that India had the highest number of people without access to basic sanitation despite efforts made by the Government of India under the Swachh Bharat Mission. [48] [49] About 522 million people practiced open defecation in India in 2014, despite having access to a toilet. [50] [51] Many factors contributed to this, ranging from poverty to government corruption. [52]\nSince then, through Swachh Bharat , a two-phase program managed by the Indian government, India has constructed around 100 million additional household toilets which would benefit 500 million people in India according to the statistics provided by Indian government (Phase 1: 2014\u20132019, Phase 2: 2020 to 2025). [53] A campaign to build toilets in urban and rural areas achieved a significant reduction in open defecation between 2014 and 2019. In September 2019, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded Indian leader Narendra Modi for his efforts in improving sanitation in the country. [54] According to UNICEF The number of people without a toilet reduced from 550 million to 50 million. [55] [56] There have also been reports of people not using the toilets despite having one, although according to the World Bank , 96% of Indians used the toilets they had. [57] [58] In October 2019, Modi declared India to be \"open defecation free\", though this announcement was met with skepticism by experts who cited slowly changing behaviors, maintenance issues, and water access issues as obstacles that continued to block India's goal of being 100% open defecation free. [59] [60]\nAlthough open defecation still continues, it has been reduced by a large amount. With the success of the Swachh Bharat Mission , Modi has to launch Phase 2 from 2020 to 2025. [61] During phase 2 the government will focus on segregation of waste and further eliminating open defecation in the country. [62]\nIn 2017, WaterAid report revealed that 79 million people in Pakistan lacked access to a decent toilet in the country. [63] [64] In 2018, 10% or 22 million people in Pakistan practiced open defecation according to the figures provided by the UNICEF . [65] [66] According to the latest UNICEF report as of 2020, 7% or 15 million people in Pakistan practice open defecation. [42]\nIn San Francisco (United States), open defecation complaints for street feces increased fivefold from 2011 to 2018, with 28,084 cases reported. This was mainly due to the rising amount of homelessness in the city. [67] Similar problems were reported in Los Angeles [68] and Miami . [69]\nThe Mad Pooper was the name given to an unidentified woman who regularly defecated in public places while jogging during summer 2017 in the U.S. city of Colorado Springs . [70]\nThe negative public health impacts of open defecation are the same as those described when there is no access to sanitation at all. Open defecation\u2014and lack of sanitation and hygiene in general\u2014is an important factor that cause various diseases; the most common being diarrhea and intestinal worm infections but also typhoid , cholera , hepatitis , polio , trachoma , and others. [71] [72]\nAdverse health effects of open defecation occur because open defecation results in fecal contamination of the local environment. Consequently, open defecators are repeatedly exposed to many kinds of fecal bacteria like gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and other fecal pathogens, and this is particularly serious for young children whose immune systems and brains are not yet fully developed. [26]\nCertain diseases are grouped together under the name of waterborne diseases , which are diseases transmitted via fecal pathogens in water. Open defecation can lead to water pollution when rain flushes feces that are dispersed in the environment into surface water or unprotected wells .\nOpen defecation was found by the WHO in 2014 to be a leading cause of diarrheal death. In 2013, about 2,000 children under the age of five died every day from diarrhea. [73]\nYoung children are particularly vulnerable to ingesting feces of other people that are lying around after open defecation, because young children crawl on the ground, walk barefoot, and put things in their mouths without washing their hands. Feces of farm animals are equally a cause of concern when children are playing in the yard.\nThose countries where open defecation is most widely practiced have the highest numbers of deaths of children under the age of five, as well as high levels of malnourishment (leading to stunted growth in children), high levels of poverty, and large disparities between rich and poor. [3]\nResearch from India has shown that detrimental health impacts (particularly for early life health) are even more significant from open defecation when the population density is high: \"The same amount of open defecation is twice as bad in a place with a high population density average like India versus a low population density average like sub-Saharan Africa.\" [74]\nOpen defecation is also badly affecting the health of children and their life quality as it creates health and psychological issues. [75]\nThere are strong gender impacts connected with a lack of adequate sanitation. In addition to the universal problems associated with open defecation, having to urinate in the open can also be problematic for females. The lack of safe, private toilets makes women and girls vulnerable to violence and is an impediment to girls' education. [76] Women are at risk of sexual molestation and rape as they search for places to urinate or defecate that are secluded and private, often during hours of darkness. [77] [76]\nLack of privacy has an especially large effect on the safety and sense of dignity of women and girls in developing countries. They face the shame of having to urinate or defecate in public so often wait until nightfall to relieve themselves. They risk being attacked after dark, though it means painfully holding their bladder and bowels all day. [78] [79] Women in developing countries increasingly express fear of assault or rape when having to leave the house after dark. Reports of attacks or harassment near or in toilet facilities, as well as near or in areas where women urinate or defecate openly, are common. [78] [79]\nThe following joint strategies can enable communities, both rural and peri-urban , to become completely open defecation free and remain so: Sanitation marketing, behavior change communication , and 'enhanced' community-led total sanitation ('CLTS + \u2019), supplemented by 'nudging'. [26]\nThere are several drivers used to eradicate open defecation, one of which is behavior change. SaniFOAM (Focus on Opportunity, Ability, and Motivation) is a conceptual framework that was developed specifically to address issues of sanitation and hygiene. Using focus, opportunity, ability and motivation as categories of determinants, SaniFOAM model identifies barriers to latrine adoption while simultaneously serving as a tool for designing, monitoring and evaluating sanitation interventions. [80] [81] The following are some of the key drivers used to fight against open defecation in addition to behavior change: [4]\n- Political will\n- Sanitation solutions that offer a better value than open defecation\n- Stronger public sector local service delivery systems\n- Creation of the right incentive structures\nEfforts to reduce open defecation are more or less the same as those to achieve the MDG target on access to sanitation . [82] A key aspect is awareness-raising (for example via the UN World Toilet Day at a global level), behavior change campaigns, increasing political will as well as demand for sanitation. Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) campaigns have placed a particular focus on ending open defecation by \"triggering\" the communities themselves into action. [83]\nThere are some simple sanitation technology options available to reduce open defecation prevalence if the open defecation behavior is due to not having toilets in the household and shared toilets being too far or too dangerous to reach, e.g., at night.\nPeople might already use plastic bags (also called flying toilets ) at night to contain their feces. However, a more advanced solution of the plastic toilet bag has been provided by the Swedish company People who are producing the \"Peepoo bag\", a \"personal, single-use, self-sanitizing, fully biodegradable toilet that prevents feces from contaminating the immediate area as well as the surrounding ecosystem\". [84] This bag is now being used in humanitarian responses, schools, and urban slums in developing countries. [85] [86]\nBucket toilets are a simple portable toilet option. They can be upgraded in various ways, one of them being urine diversion which can make them similar to urine-diverting dry toilets . Urine diversion can significantly reduce odors from dry toilets . Examples of using this type of toilet to reduce open defecation are the \"MoSan\" [87] toilet (used in Kenya) or the urine-diverting dry toilet promoted by SOIL [88] in Haiti.\nThe mainstream media in some affected countries have recently been picking up on this issue of open defecation, for example, in India [89] [90] and Pakistan. [91] [92] [93]\nIn certain jurisdictions, open or public defecation is a criminal offense which can be punished with a fine or even imprisonment. [94] [95] [96]\nDavid Sedaris ' essay \"Adventures at Poo Corner\" dealt with people who openly defecate in commercial businesses. [97]\nSome national parks prohibit open defecation in some areas. [98] [99] If defecating openly, the general advice is to defecate into a dug hole, and cover with soil. [99]", "source_raw_text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Open defecation is the human practice of defecating outside (\"in the open\") rather than into a toilet . People may choose fields, bushes, forests, ditches, streets, canals, or other open spaces for defecation. They do so either because they do not have a toilet readily accessible or due to traditional cultural practices. [2] The practice is common where sanitation infrastructure and services are not available. Even if toilets are available, behavior change efforts may still be needed to promote the use of toilets. 'Open defecation free' (ODF) is a term used to describe communities that have shifted to using toilets instead of open defecation. This can happen, for example, after community-led total sanitation programs have been implemented. Open defecation can pollute the environment and cause health problems and diseases. High levels of open defecation are linked to high child mortality , poor nutrition , poverty , and large disparities between rich and poor. [3] : 11 Ending open defecation is an indicator being used to measure progress towards the Sustainable Development Goal Number 6 . Extreme poverty and lack of sanitation are statistically linked. Therefore, eliminating open defecation is thought to be an important part of the effort to eliminate poverty. [4] As of 2019 an estimated 673 million people practice open defecation, [5] : 74 down from about 892 million people (12 percent of the global population) in 2016. [6] In that year, 76 percent (678 million) of the people practicing open defecation in the world lived in just seven countries. [6] In ancient times, there were more open spaces and less population pressure on land. It was believed that defecating in the open causes little harm when done in areas with low population, forests, or camping-type situations. With development and urbanization, open defecating started becoming a challenge and thereby an important public health issue, and an issue of human dignity . [7] With the increase in population in smaller areas, such as cities and towns, more attention was given to hygiene and health. As a result, there was an increase in global attention towards reducing the practice of open defecation. [8] Open defecation perpetuates the vicious cycle of disease and poverty and is widely regarded as an affront to personal dignity. [3] The countries where open defecation is most widely practiced have the highest numbers of deaths of children under the age of five, as well as high levels of undernutrition , high levels of poverty, and large disparities between people of means and the poor.

This was due to the publications by the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) and the UN International Year of Sanitation . The JMP is a joint program by WHO and UNICEF that was earlier tasked to monitor the water and sanitation targets of the Millennium development goals (MDGs); it is now tasked to monitor Sustainable Development Goal Number 6 . For monitoring of the MDG Number 7, two categories were created: 1) improved sanitation and (2) unimproved sanitation . Open defecation falls into the category of unimproved sanitation. This means that people who practice open defecation do not have access to improved sanitation. In 2013 World Toilet Day was celebrated as an official UN day for the first time. The term \"open defecation\" was used in high-level speeches, that helped to draw global attention to this issue (for example, in the \"call to action\" on sanitation issued by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations in March 2013). [9] \"Open defecation free\" (ODF) is a phrase first used in community-led total sanitation (CLTS) programs. ODF has now entered use in other contexts. The original meaning of ODF stated that all community members are using sanitation facilities (such as toilets) instead of going to the open for defecation. This definition was improved and more criteria were added in some countries that have adopted the CLTS approach in their programs to stop the practice of open defecation. [10] The Indian Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation in mid-2015 defined ODF as \"the termination of fecal-oral transmission , defined by: No visible feces found in the environment or village and Every household as well as public/community institutions using safe technology option for disposal of feces\". [11] Here, a \"safe technology option\" means a toilet that contains feces so that there is no contamination of surface soil, groundwater or surface water ; flies or animals do not come in contact with the open feces; no one handles excreta; there is no smell and there are no visible feces around in the environment. [12] This definition is part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Campaign). The reasons for open defecation are varied. It can be a voluntary, semi-voluntary or involuntary choice. Most of the time, a lack of access to a toilet is the reason. However, in some places even people with toilets in their houses prefer to defecate in the open. [10] A few broad factors that result in the practice of open defecation are listed below. Lack of infrastructure: People often lack toilets in their houses, or in the areas where they live. [5] [13] Lack of toilets in other places: Lack of toilets in places away from people's houses, such as in schools or in the farms leads the people to defecate in the open. [13] Another example is a lack of public toilets in cities, whether by a reluctance among businesses to allow patrons to use their toilets or limited hours (e.g. if there are no 24-hour businesses in town and someone needs to use the toilet after regular business hours), which can be a big problem for homeless people . [14] Use of toilets for other purposes: In some rural communities, toilets are used for other purposes, such as storing household items, animals, farm products or used as kitchens. In such cases, people go outside to defecate. [15] [16] Poor quality of toilet: Sometimes people have access to a toilet, but the toilet might be broken, or of poor quality \u2013 outdoor toilets (pit latrines in particular) typically are devoid of any type of cleaning and reek of odors. Sometimes, toilets are not well lit at all times, especially in areas that lack electricity. Others lack doors or may not have water. Toilets with maggots or cockroaches are also disliked by people and hence, they go out to defecate. [17] [18] [19] [13] Risky and unsafe: Some toilets are risky to access. There may be a risk to personal safety due to lack of lights at night, criminals around them, or the presence of animals such as snakes and dogs. Women and children who do not have toilets inside their houses are often found to be scared to access shared or public toilets, especially at night. [19] [20] Accessing toilets that are not located in the house might be a problem for disabled people, especially at night. [21] In some parts of the world, Zambia for example, very young children are discouraged from using pit latines due to the risk of them falling through the open drop-hole. In such cases when there is no other available sanitation facility, children are encouraged to practice open defecation. [22] Presence of toilet but not privacy: Some toilets do not have a real door, but have a cloth hung as a door. In some communities, toilets are located in places where women are shy to access them due to the presence of men. [23] [21] [13] Lack of water near toilet: Absence of supply of water inside or next to toilets cause people to get water from a distance before using the toilet. [13] This is an additional task and needs extra time. Too many people using a toilet: This is especially true in the case of shared or public toilets. If too many people want to use a toilet at the same time, then some people may go outside to defecate instead of waiting. In some cases, people might not be able to wait due to diarrhea (or the result of an Inflammatory Bowel Disease emergency). Fear of the pit getting filled: In some places, people are scared that their toilet pits will get filled very fast if all family members use them every day. So they continue to go out to delay the toilet pit filling up. This is especially true in the case of a pit latrine. [19] [21] Lack of awareness: People in some communities do not know about the benefits of using toilets. [24] [25] Lack of behavior change : Some communities have toilets, yet people prefer to defecate in the open. [10] In some cases, these toilets are provided by the government or other organizations and the people do not like them, or do not value them. They continue to defecate in the open. Also, older people are often found to defecate in the open and they are hesitant to change their behavior and go inside a closed toilet. [13] Prefer being in nature: This happens mostly in less populated or rural areas, where people walk outside early in the morning and go to defecate in the fields or bushes. They prefer to be in nature and the fresh air; instead of defecating in a closed space such as a toilet. [4] There may be a cultural or habitual preference for defecating \"in the open air\", beside a local river or stream, or even the bush. Combining open defecation with other activities: Some people walk early in the morning to look after their farms. Some consider it a social activity, especially women who like to take some time to go out of their homes. While on their way to the fields for open defecation they can talk to other women and take care of their animals. [13] Social norms : Open defecation is a part of people's life and daily habits in some regions. For instance, a 2011 survey in rural East Java , Indonesia, found that many men considered the practice \u2018normal\u2019, and having distinct benefits such as social interaction and physical comfort. [26] In some cultures, there may be social taboos where a father-in-law may not use the same toilet as a daughter-in-law in the same household. [ citation needed ] Social or personal preferences: Open defecation is a preferred practice in some parts of the world, with many respondents in a survey from 2015 stating that \"open defecation was more pleasurable and desirable than latrine use\". [26] In some societies, open defecation is an intentional means of fertilization which is widely-used. Fecal incontinence : This medical condition can result in abrupt 'emergencies' and not enough time to access a toilet. In developed countries , open defecation can be due to homelessness . Open defecation in developed areas is also considered to be a part of recreational outdoor activities such as camping in remote areas. It is difficult to estimate how many people practice open defecation in these communities. The practice of open defecation is strongly related to poverty and exclusion particularly, in the case of rural areas and informal urban settlements in developing countries . The Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) of UNICEF and WHO has been collecting data regarding open defecation prevalence worldwide. The figures are segregated by rural and urban areas and by levels of poverty. This program is tasked to monitor progress towards the millennium development goal (MDG) relating to drinking water and sanitation. As open defecation is one example of unimproved sanitation , it is being monitored by JMP for each country, and results are published on a regular basis. [28] [6] The figures on open defecation used to be lumped together with other figures on unimproved sanitation but are collected separately since 2010. The current estimate is that around 673 million people practice open defecation. [5] : 74 The number of people practicing open defecation fell from 20 percent in 2000 to 12 percent in 2015. [6] : 34 In 2016, the estimate was for 892 million people with no sanitation facility whatsoever and therefore practicing open defecation (in gutters, behind bushes, in open water bodies, etc.). Most people (9 of 10) who practice open defecation live in rural areas, but the vast majority lives in two regions ( Central Africa and South Asia ). [6] In 2016, seventy-six percent (678 million) of the 892 million people practicing open defecation in the world lived in just seven countries. [6] Some countries with large numbers of people who openly defecate are listed in the table below. Country Total population Percentage and Number of people who defecate in the open Other estimates (based on government-provided data or other sources) Cambodia 16,949,415 17% or 2.8 million (2021) [29] Chad 16,244,513 69% or 11 million (2018) [30] China 1,411,778,724 1% or ~13 million (2018) Eritrea 5,228,000 76% or 4 million (2017) Ethiopia 117,876,227 18% or 20.1 million (2020) [31] India 1,352,642,280 15% or ~209.4 million(World Bank 2020) [32] 48% or 594 million(according to UNICEF) [33] The National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey of India reported that 96.5% of rural households in India had toilets. The Indian government's own estimate in January 2019 was 1.4% or 19 million. [34] [35] [36] [37] According to World Bank, 15% Indians practice open defecation [38] Indonesia 270,203,917 9% or 25 million (2020) [ citation needed ] } [39] Nepal 28,095,714 10% or 2.8 million (2019) [40] Niger 24,112,753 68% or 14 million (2017) Nigeria 211,400,708 24% or 48 million (2021) [41] Pakistan 225,199,937 7% or 15 million (2020) [42] Philippines 106,651,394 4% or 4 million (2020) [43] South Sudan 12,778,250 63% or 6 million (2019) Sudan 44,909,353 27% or 11 million (2017) Vietnam 96,208,984 4% or 3.7 million (2017) Open defecation is widely practised in India. Globally, India has the largest number of people, close to 594 million which is 48% of Indians practise open defecation. [44] About half the population of India use toilets. [45] With 44 per cent of mothers disposing their children\u2019s faeces in the open, there is a very high risk of microbial contamination (bacteria, viruses, amoeba) of water which causes diarrhea in children. [46] Although access to sanitation in rural India is improving, the increase is not equitable. Open defecation is still almost universal among the poorest 20% of India. [47] A report published by WaterAid stated that India had the highest number of people without access to basic sanitation despite efforts made by the Government of India under the Swachh Bharat Mission. [48] [49] About 522 million people practiced open defecation in India in 2014, despite having access to a toilet. [50] [51] Many factors contributed to this, ranging from poverty to government corruption. [52] Since then, through Swachh Bharat , a two-phase program managed by the Indian government, India has constructed around 100 million additional household toilets which would benefit 500 million people in India according to the statistics provided by Indian government (Phase 1: 2014\u20132019, Phase 2: 2020 to 2025). [53] A campaign to build toilets in urban and rural areas achieved a significant reduction in open defecation between 2014 and 2019. In September 2019, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded Indian leader Narendra Modi for his efforts in improving sanitation in the country. [54] According to UNICEF The number of people without a toilet reduced from 550 million to 50 million. [55] [56] There have also been reports of people not using the toilets despite having one, although according to the World Bank , 96% of Indians used the toilets they had. [57] [58] In October 2019, Modi declared India to be \"open defecation free\", though this announcement was met with skepticism by experts who cited slowly changing behaviors, maintenance issues, and water access issues as obstacles that continued to block India's goal of being 100% open defecation free. [59] [60] Although open defecation still continues, it has been reduced by a large amount. With the success of the Swachh Bharat Mission , Modi has to launch Phase 2 from 2020 to 2025. [61] During phase 2 the government will focus on segregation of waste and further eliminating open defecation in the country. [62] In 2017, WaterAid report revealed that 79 million people in Pakistan lacked access to a decent toilet in the country. [63] [64] In 2018, 10% or 22 million people in Pakistan practiced open defecation according to the figures provided by the UNICEF . [65] [66] According to the latest UNICEF report as of 2020, 7% or 15 million people in Pakistan practice open defecation. [42] In San Francisco (United States), open defecation complaints for street feces increased fivefold from 2011 to 2018, with 28,084 cases reported. This was mainly due to the rising amount of homelessness in the city. [67] Similar problems were reported in Los Angeles [68] and Miami . [69] The Mad Pooper was the name given to an unidentified woman who regularly defecated in public places while jogging during summer 2017 in the U.S. city of Colorado Springs . [70] The negative public health impacts of open defecation are the same as those described when there is no access to sanitation at all.

practice of defecating outside (\"in the open\") rather than into a toilet . People may choose fields, bushes, forests, ditches, streets, canals, or other open spaces for defecation. They do so either because they do not have a toilet readily accessible or due to traditional cultural practices. [2] The practice is common where sanitation infrastructure and services are not available. Even if toilets are available, behavior change efforts may still be needed to promote the use of toilets. 'Open defecation free' (ODF) is a term used to describe communities that have shifted to using toilets instead of open defecation. This can happen, for example, after community-led total sanitation programs have been implemented.\nOpen defecation can pollute the environment and cause health problems and diseases. High levels of open defecation are linked to high child mortality , poor nutrition , poverty , and large disparities between rich and poor. [3] : 11 Ending open defecation is an indicator being used to measure progress towards the Sustainable Development Goal Number 6 . Extreme poverty and lack of sanitation are statistically linked. Therefore, eliminating open defecation is thought to be an important part of the effort to eliminate poverty. [4]\nAs of 2019 an estimated 673 million people practice open defecation, [5] : 74 down from about 892 million people (12 percent of the global population) in 2016. [6] In that year, 76 percent (678 million) of the people practicing open defecation in the world lived in just seven countries. [6]\nIn ancient times, there were more open spaces and less population pressure on land. It was believed that defecating in the open causes little harm when done in areas with low population, forests, or camping-type situations. With development and urbanization, open defecating started becoming a challenge and thereby an important public health issue, and an issue of human dignity . [7] With the increase in population in smaller areas, such as cities and towns, more attention was given to hygiene and health. As a result, there was an increase in global attention towards reducing the practice of open defecation. [8]\nOpen defecation perpetuates the vicious cycle of disease and poverty and is widely regarded as an affront to personal dignity. [3] The countries where open defecation is most widely practiced have the highest numbers of deaths of children under the age of five, as well as high levels of undernutrition , high levels of poverty, and large disparities between people of means and the poor.

This was due to the publications by the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) and the UN International Year of Sanitation . The JMP is a joint program by WHO and UNICEF that was earlier tasked to monitor the water and sanitation targets of the Millennium development goals (MDGs); it is now tasked to monitor Sustainable Development Goal Number 6 .\nFor monitoring of the MDG Number 7, two categories were created: 1) improved sanitation and (2) unimproved sanitation . Open defecation falls into the category of unimproved sanitation. This means that people who practice open defecation do not have access to improved sanitation.\nIn 2013 World Toilet Day was celebrated as an official UN day for the first time. The term \"open defecation\" was used in high-level speeches, that helped to draw global attention to this issue (for example, in the \"call to action\" on sanitation issued by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations in March 2013). [9]\n\"Open defecation free\" (ODF) is a phrase first used in community-led total sanitation (CLTS) programs. ODF has now entered use in other contexts. The original meaning of ODF stated that all community members are using sanitation facilities (such as toilets) instead of going to the open for defecation. This definition was improved and more criteria were added in some countries that have adopted the CLTS approach in their programs to stop the practice of open defecation. [10]\nThe Indian Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation in mid-2015 defined ODF as \"the termination of fecal-oral transmission , defined by:\n- No visible feces found in the environment or village and\n- Every household as well as public/community institutions using safe technology option for disposal of feces\". [11]\nHere, a \"safe technology option\" means a toilet that contains feces so that there is no contamination of surface soil, groundwater or surface water ; flies or animals do not come in contact with the open feces; no one handles excreta; there is no smell and there are no visible feces around in the environment. [12] This definition is part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Campaign).\nThe reasons for open defecation are varied. It can be a voluntary, semi-voluntary or involuntary choice. Most of the time, a lack of access to a toilet is the reason. However, in some places even people with toilets in their houses prefer to defecate in the open. [10]\nA few broad factors that result in the practice of open defecation are listed below.\n- Lack of infrastructure: People often lack toilets in their houses, or in the areas where they live. [5] [13]\n- Lack of toilets in other places: Lack of toilets in places away from people's houses, such as in schools or in the farms leads the people to defecate in the open. [13] Another example is a lack of public toilets in cities, whether by a reluctance among businesses to allow patrons to use their toilets or limited hours (e.g. if there are no 24-hour businesses in town and someone needs to use the toilet after regular business hours), which can be a big problem for homeless people . [14]\n- Use of toilets for other purposes: In some rural communities, toilets are used for other purposes, such as storing household items, animals, farm products or used as kitchens. In such cases, people go outside to defecate. [15] [16]\n- Poor quality of toilet: Sometimes people have access to a toilet, but the toilet might be broken, or of poor quality \u2013 outdoor toilets (pit latrines in particular) typically are devoid of any type of cleaning and reek of odors. Sometimes, toilets are not well lit at all times, especially in areas that lack electricity. Others lack doors or may not have water. Toilets with maggots or cockroaches are also disliked by people and hence, they go out to defecate. [17] [18] [19] [13]\n- Risky and unsafe: Some toilets are risky to access. There may be a risk to personal safety due to lack of lights at night, criminals around them, or the presence of animals such as snakes and dogs. Women and children who do not have toilets inside their houses are often found to be scared to access shared or public toilets, especially at night. [19] [20] Accessing toilets that are not located in the house might be a problem for disabled people, especially at night. [21] In some parts of the world, Zambia for example, very young children are discouraged from using pit latines due to the risk of them falling through the open drop-hole. In such cases when there is no other available sanitation facility, children are encouraged to practice open defecation. [22]\n- Presence of toilet but not privacy: Some toilets do not have a real door, but have a cloth hung as a door. In some communities, toilets are located in places where women are shy to access them due to the presence of men. [23] [21] [13]\n- Lack of water near toilet: Absence of supply of water inside or next to toilets cause people to get water from a distance before using the toilet. [13] This is an additional task and needs extra time.\n- Too many people using a toilet: This is especially true in the case of shared or public toilets. If too many people want to use a toilet at the same time, then some people may go outside to defecate instead of waiting. In some cases, people might not be able to wait due to diarrhea (or the result of an Inflammatory Bowel Disease emergency).\n- Fear of the pit getting filled: In some places, people are scared that their toilet pits will get filled very fast if all family members use them every day. So they continue to go out to delay the toilet pit filling up. This is especially true in the case of a pit latrine. [19] [21]\n- Lack of awareness: People in some communities do not know about the benefits of using toilets. [24] [25]\n- Lack of behavior change : Some communities have toilets, yet people prefer to defecate in the open. [10] In some cases, these toilets are provided by the government or other organizations and the people do not like them, or do not value them. They continue to defecate in the open. Also, older people are often found to defecate in the open and they are hesitant to change their behavior and go inside a closed toilet.

[4] There may be a cultural or habitual preference for defecating \"in the open air\", beside a local river or stream, or even the bush.\n- Combining open defecation with other activities: Some people walk early in the morning to look after their farms. Some consider it a social activity, especially women who like to take some time to go out of their homes. While on their way to the fields for open defecation they can talk to other women and take care of their animals. [13]\n- Social norms : Open defecation is a part of people's life and daily habits in some regions. For instance, a 2011 survey in rural East Java , Indonesia, found that many men considered the practice \u2018normal\u2019, and having distinct benefits such as social interaction and physical comfort. [26] In some cultures, there may be social taboos where a father-in-law may not use the same toilet as a daughter-in-law in the same household. [ citation needed ]\n- Social or personal preferences: Open defecation is a preferred practice in some parts of the world, with many respondents in a survey from 2015 stating that \"open defecation was more pleasurable and desirable than latrine use\". [26]\n- In some societies, open defecation is an intentional means of fertilization which is widely-used.\n- Fecal incontinence : This medical condition can result in abrupt 'emergencies' and not enough time to access a toilet.\nIn developed countries , open defecation can be due to homelessness . Open defecation in developed areas is also considered to be a part of recreational outdoor activities such as camping in remote areas. It is difficult to estimate how many people practice open defecation in these communities.\nThe practice of open defecation is strongly related to poverty and exclusion particularly, in the case of rural areas and informal urban settlements in developing countries . The Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) of UNICEF and WHO has been collecting data regarding open defecation prevalence worldwide. The figures are segregated by rural and urban areas and by levels of poverty. This program is tasked to monitor progress towards the millennium development goal (MDG) relating to drinking water and sanitation. As open defecation is one example of unimproved sanitation , it is being monitored by JMP for each country, and results are published on a regular basis. [28] [6] The figures on open defecation used to be lumped together with other figures on unimproved sanitation but are collected separately since 2010.\nThe current estimate is that around 673 million people practice open defecation. [5] : 74\nThe number of people practicing open defecation fell from 20 percent in 2000 to 12 percent in 2015. [6] : 34 In 2016, the estimate was for 892 million people with no sanitation facility whatsoever and therefore practicing open defecation (in gutters, behind bushes, in open water bodies, etc.). Most people (9 of 10) who practice open defecation live in rural areas, but the vast majority lives in two regions ( Central Africa and South Asia ). [6] In 2016, seventy-six percent (678 million) of the 892 million people practicing open defecation in the world lived in just seven countries. [6]\nSome countries with large numbers of people who openly defecate are listed in the table below.\n|Country||Total population||Percentage and Number of people who defecate in the open||Other estimates (based on government-provided data or other sources)|\n|Cambodia||16,949,415||17% or 2.8 million (2021) [29]|\n|Chad||16,244,513||69% or 11 million (2018) [30]|\n|China||1,411,778,724||1% or ~13 million (2018)|\n|Eritrea||5,228,000||76% or 4 million (2017)|\n|Ethiopia||117,876,227||18% or 20.1 million (2020) [31]|\n|India||1,352,642,280|\n15% or ~209.4 million(World Bank 2020) [32] 48% or 594 million(according to UNICEF) [33]\nThe National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey of India reported that 96.5% of rural households in India had toilets.

Globally, India has the largest number of people, close to 594 million which is 48% of Indians practise open defecation. [44] About half the population of India use toilets. [45] With 44 per cent of mothers disposing their children\u2019s faeces in the open, there is a very high risk of microbial contamination (bacteria, viruses, amoeba) of water which causes diarrhea in children. [46] Although access to sanitation in rural India is improving, the increase is not equitable. Open defecation is still almost universal among the poorest 20% of India. [47] A report published by WaterAid stated that India had the highest number of people without access to basic sanitation despite efforts made by the Government of India under the Swachh Bharat Mission. [48] [49] About 522 million people practiced open defecation in India in 2014, despite having access to a toilet. [50] [51] Many factors contributed to this, ranging from poverty to government corruption. [52]\nSince then, through Swachh Bharat , a two-phase program managed by the Indian government, India has constructed around 100 million additional household toilets which would benefit 500 million people in India according to the statistics provided by Indian government (Phase 1: 2014\u20132019, Phase 2: 2020 to 2025). [53] A campaign to build toilets in urban and rural areas achieved a significant reduction in open defecation between 2014 and 2019. In September 2019, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded Indian leader Narendra Modi for his efforts in improving sanitation in the country. [54] According to UNICEF The number of people without a toilet reduced from 550 million to 50 million. [55] [56] There have also been reports of people not using the toilets despite having one, although according to the World Bank , 96% of Indians used the toilets they had. [57] [58] In October 2019, Modi declared India to be \"open defecation free\", though this announcement was met with skepticism by experts who cited slowly changing behaviors, maintenance issues, and water access issues as obstacles that continued to block India's goal of being 100% open defecation free. [59] [60]\nAlthough open defecation still continues, it has been reduced by a large amount. With the success of the Swachh Bharat Mission , Modi has to launch Phase 2 from 2020 to 2025. [61] During phase 2 the government will focus on segregation of waste and further eliminating open defecation in the country. [62]\nIn 2017, WaterAid report revealed that 79 million people in Pakistan lacked access to a decent toilet in the country. [63] [64] In 2018, 10% or 22 million people in Pakistan practiced open defecation according to the figures provided by the UNICEF . [65] [66] According to the latest UNICEF report as of 2020, 7% or 15 million people in Pakistan practice open defecation. [42]\nIn San Francisco (United States), open defecation complaints for street feces increased fivefold from 2011 to 2018, with 28,084 cases reported. This was mainly due to the rising amount of homelessness in the city. [67] Similar problems were reported in Los Angeles [68] and Miami . [69]\nThe Mad Pooper was the name given to an unidentified woman who regularly defecated in public places while jogging during summer 2017 in the U.S. city of Colorado Springs . [70]\nThe negative public health impacts of open defecation are the same as those described when there is no access to sanitation at all. Open defecation\u2014and lack of sanitation and hygiene in general\u2014is an important factor that cause various diseases; the most common being diarrhea and intestinal worm infections but also typhoid , cholera , hepatitis , polio , trachoma , and others. [71] [72]\nAdverse health effects of open defecation occur because open defecation results in fecal contamination of the local environment. Consequently, open defecators are repeatedly exposed to many kinds of fecal bacteria like gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and other fecal pathogens, and this is particularly serious for young children whose immune systems and brains are not yet fully developed. [26]\nCertain diseases are grouped together under the name of waterborne diseases , which are diseases transmitted via fecal pathogens in water. Open defecation can lead to water pollution when rain flushes feces that are dispersed in the environment into surface water or unprotected wells .\nOpen defecation was found by the WHO in 2014 to be a leading cause of diarrheal death. In 2013, about 2,000 children under the age of five died every day from diarrhea. [73]\nYoung children are particularly vulnerable to ingesting feces of other people that are lying around after open defecation, because young children crawl on the ground, walk barefoot, and put things in their mouths without washing their hands. Feces of farm animals are equally a cause of concern when children are playing in the yard.\nThose countries where open defecation is most widely practiced have the highest numbers of deaths of children under the age of five, as well as high levels of malnourishment (leading to stunted growth in children), high levels of poverty, and large disparities between rich and poor. [3]\nResearch from India has shown that detrimental health impacts (particularly for early life health) are even more significant from open defecation when the population density is high: \"The same amount of open defecation is twice as bad in a place with a high population density average like India versus a low population density average like sub-Saharan Africa.\" [74]\nOpen defecation is also badly affecting the health of children and their life quality as it creates health and psychological issues. [75]\nThere are strong gender impacts connected with a lack of adequate sanitation. In addition to the universal problems associated with open defecation, having to urinate in the open can also be problematic for females. The lack of safe, private toilets makes women and girls vulnerable to violence and is an impediment to girls' education. [76] Women are at risk of sexual molestation and rape as they search for places to urinate or defecate that are secluded and private, often during hours of darkness. [77] [76]\nLack of privacy has an especially large effect on the safety and sense of dignity of women and girls in developing countries. They face the shame of having to urinate or defecate in public so often wait until nightfall to relieve themselves. They risk being attacked after dark, though it means painfully holding their bladder and bowels all day. [78] [79] Women in developing countries increasingly express fear of assault or rape when having to leave the house after dark. Reports of attacks or harassment near or in toilet facilities, as well as near or in areas where women urinate or defecate openly, are common. [78] [79]\nThe following joint strategies can enable communities, both rural and peri-urban , to become completely open defecation free and remain so: Sanitation marketing, behavior change communication , and 'enhanced' community-led total sanitation ('CLTS + \u2019), supplemented by 'nudging'. [26]\nThere are several drivers used to eradicate open defecation, one of which is behavior change. SaniFOAM (Focus on Opportunity, Ability, and Motivation) is a conceptual framework that was developed specifically to address issues of sanitation and hygiene. Using focus, opportunity, ability and motivation as categories of determinants, SaniFOAM model identifies barriers to latrine adoption while simultaneously serving as a tool for designing, monitoring and evaluating sanitation interventions. [80] [81] The following are some of the key drivers used to fight against open defecation in addition to behavior change: [4]\n- Political will\n- Sanitation solutions that offer a better value than open defecation\n- Stronger public sector local service delivery systems\n- Creation of the right incentive structures\nEfforts to reduce open defecation are more or less the same as those to achieve the MDG target on access to sanitation . [82] A key aspect is awareness-raising (for example via the UN World Toilet Day at a global level), behavior change campaigns, increasing political will as well as demand for sanitation. Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) campaigns have placed a particular focus on ending open defecation by \"triggering\" the communities themselves into action. [83]\nThere are some simple sanitation technology options available to reduce open defecation prevalence if the open defecation behavior is due to not having toilets in the household and shared toilets being too far or too dangerous to reach, e.g., at night.\nPeople might already use plastic bags (also called flying toilets ) at night to contain their feces. However, a more advanced solution of the plastic toilet bag has been provided by the Swedish company People who are producing the \"Peepoo bag\", a \"personal, single-use, self-sanitizing, fully biodegradable toilet that prevents feces from contaminating the immediate area as well as the surrounding ecosystem\". [84] This bag is now being used in humanitarian responses, schools, and urban slums in developing countries. [85] [86]\nBucket toilets are a simple portable toilet option. They can be upgraded in various ways, one of them being urine diversion which can make them similar to urine-diverting dry toilets . Urine diversion can significantly reduce odors from dry toilets . Examples of using this type of toilet to reduce open defecation are the \"MoSan\" [87] toilet (used in Kenya) or the urine-diverting dry toilet promoted by SOIL [88] in Haiti.\nThe mainstream media in some affected countries have recently been picking up on this issue of open defecation, for example, in India [89] [90] and Pakistan. [91] [92] [93]\nIn certain jurisdictions, open or public defecation is a criminal offense which can be punished with a fine or even imprisonment. [94] [95] [96]\nDavid Sedaris ' essay \"Adventures at Poo Corner\" dealt with people who openly defecate in commercial businesses. [97]\nSome national parks prohibit open defecation in some areas. [98] [99] If defecating openly, the general advice is to defecate into a dug hole, and cover with soil. [99]", "source_raw_text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Open defecation is the human practice of defecating outside (\"in the open\") rather than into a toilet . People may choose fields, bushes, forests, ditches, streets, canals, or other open spaces for defecation. They do so either because they do not have a toilet readily accessible or due to traditional cultural practices. [2] The practice is common where sanitation infrastructure and services are not available. Even if toilets are available, behavior change efforts may still be needed to promote the use of toilets. 'Open defecation free' (ODF) is a term used to describe communities that have shifted to using toilets instead of open defecation. This can happen, for example, after community-led total sanitation programs have been implemented. Open defecation can pollute the environment and cause health problems and diseases. High levels of open defecation are linked to high child mortality , poor nutrition , poverty , and large disparities between rich and poor. [3] : 11 Ending open defecation is an indicator being used to measure progress towards the Sustainable Development Goal Number 6 . Extreme poverty and lack of sanitation are statistically linked. Therefore, eliminating open defecation is thought to be an important part of the effort to eliminate poverty. [4] As of 2019 an estimated 673 million people practice open defecation, [5] : 74 down from about 892 million people (12 percent of the global population) in 2016. [6] In that year, 76 percent (678 million) of the people practicing open defecation in the world lived in just seven countries. [6] In ancient times, there were more open spaces and less population pressure on land. It was believed that defecating in the open causes little harm when done in areas with low population, forests, or camping-type situations. With development and urbanization, open defecating started becoming a challenge and thereby an important public health issue, and an issue of human dignity . [7] With the increase in population in smaller areas, such as cities and towns, more attention was given to hygiene and health. As a result, there was an increase in global attention towards reducing the practice of open defecation. [8] Open defecation perpetuates the vicious cycle of disease and poverty and is widely regarded as an affront to personal dignity. [3] The countries where open defecation is most widely practiced have the highest numbers of deaths of children under the age of five, as well as high levels of undernutrition , high levels of poverty, and large disparities between people of means and the poor.

This was due to the publications by the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) and the UN International Year of Sanitation . The JMP is a joint program by WHO and UNICEF that was earlier tasked to monitor the water and sanitation targets of the Millennium development goals (MDGs); it is now tasked to monitor Sustainable Development Goal Number 6 . For monitoring of the MDG Number 7, two categories were created: 1) improved sanitation and (2) unimproved sanitation . Open defecation falls into the category of unimproved sanitation. This means that people who practice open defecation do not have access to improved sanitation. In 2013 World Toilet Day was celebrated as an official UN day for the first time. The term \"open defecation\" was used in high-level speeches, that helped to draw global attention to this issue (for example, in the \"call to action\" on sanitation issued by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations in March 2013). [9] \"Open defecation free\" (ODF) is a phrase first used in community-led total sanitation (CLTS) programs. ODF has now entered use in other contexts. The original meaning of ODF stated that all community members are using sanitation facilities (such as toilets) instead of going to the open for defecation. This definition was improved and more criteria were added in some countries that have adopted the CLTS approach in their programs to stop the practice of open defecation. [10] The Indian Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation in mid-2015 defined ODF as \"the termination of fecal-oral transmission , defined by: No visible feces found in the environment or village and Every household as well as public/community institutions using safe technology option for disposal of feces\". [11] Here, a \"safe technology option\" means a toilet that contains feces so that there is no contamination of surface soil, groundwater or surface water ; flies or animals do not come in contact with the open feces; no one handles excreta; there is no smell and there are no visible feces around in the environment. [12] This definition is part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Campaign). The reasons for open defecation are varied. It can be a voluntary, semi-voluntary or involuntary choice. Most of the time, a lack of access to a toilet is the reason. However, in some places even people with toilets in their houses prefer to defecate in the open. [10] A few broad factors that result in the practice of open defecation are listed below. Lack of infrastructure: People often lack toilets in their houses, or in the areas where they live. [5] [13] Lack of toilets in other places: Lack of toilets in places away from people's houses, such as in schools or in the farms leads the people to defecate in the open. [13] Another example is a lack of public toilets in cities, whether by a reluctance among businesses to allow patrons to use their toilets or limited hours (e.g. if there are no 24-hour businesses in town and someone needs to use the toilet after regular business hours), which can be a big problem for homeless people . [14] Use of toilets for other purposes: In some rural communities, toilets are used for other purposes, such as storing household items, animals, farm products or used as kitchens. In such cases, people go outside to defecate. [15] [16] Poor quality of toilet: Sometimes people have access to a toilet, but the toilet might be broken, or of poor quality \u2013 outdoor toilets (pit latrines in particular) typically are devoid of any type of cleaning and reek of odors. Sometimes, toilets are not well lit at all times, especially in areas that lack electricity. Others lack doors or may not have water. Toilets with maggots or cockroaches are also disliked by people and hence, they go out to defecate. [17] [18] [19] [13] Risky and unsafe: Some toilets are risky to access. There may be a risk to personal safety due to lack of lights at night, criminals around them, or the presence of animals such as snakes and dogs. Women and children who do not have toilets inside their houses are often found to be scared to access shared or public toilets, especially at night. [19] [20] Accessing toilets that are not located in the house might be a problem for disabled people, especially at night. [21] In some parts of the world, Zambia for example, very young children are discouraged from using pit latines due to the risk of them falling through the open drop-hole. In such cases when there is no other available sanitation facility, children are encouraged to practice open defecation. [22] Presence of toilet but not privacy: Some toilets do not have a real door, but have a cloth hung as a door. In some communities, toilets are located in places where women are shy to access them due to the presence of men. [23] [21] [13] Lack of water near toilet: Absence of supply of water inside or next to toilets cause people to get water from a distance before using the toilet. [13] This is an additional task and needs extra time. Too many people using a toilet: This is especially true in the case of shared or public toilets. If too many people want to use a toilet at the same time, then some people may go outside to defecate instead of waiting. In some cases, people might not be able to wait due to diarrhea (or the result of an Inflammatory Bowel Disease emergency). Fear of the pit getting filled: In some places, people are scared that their toilet pits will get filled very fast if all family members use them every day. So they continue to go out to delay the toilet pit filling up. This is especially true in the case of a pit latrine. [19] [21] Lack of awareness: People in some communities do not know about the benefits of using toilets. [24] [25] Lack of behavior change : Some communities have toilets, yet people prefer to defecate in the open. [10] In some cases, these toilets are provided by the government or other organizations and the people do not like them, or do not value them. They continue to defecate in the open. Also, older people are often found to defecate in the open and they are hesitant to change their behavior and go inside a closed toilet. [13] Prefer being in nature: This happens mostly in less populated or rural areas, where people walk outside early in the morning and go to defecate in the fields or bushes. They prefer to be in nature and the fresh air; instead of defecating in a closed space such as a toilet. [4] There may be a cultural or habitual preference for defecating \"in the open air\", beside a local river or stream, or even the bush. Combining open defecation with other activities: Some people walk early in the morning to look after their farms. Some consider it a social activity, especially women who like to take some time to go out of their homes. While on their way to the fields for open defecation they can talk to other women and take care of their animals. [13] Social norms : Open defecation is a part of people's life and daily habits in some regions. For instance, a 2011 survey in rural East Java , Indonesia, found that many men considered the practice \u2018normal\u2019, and having distinct benefits such as social interaction and physical comfort. [26] In some cultures, there may be social taboos where a father-in-law may not use the same toilet as a daughter-in-law in the same household. [ citation needed ] Social or personal preferences: Open defecation is a preferred practice in some parts of the world, with many respondents in a survey from 2015 stating that \"open defecation was more pleasurable and desirable than latrine use\". [26] In some societies, open defecation is an intentional means of fertilization which is widely-used. Fecal incontinence : This medical condition can result in abrupt 'emergencies' and not enough time to access a toilet. In developed countries , open defecation can be due to homelessness . Open defecation in developed areas is also considered to be a part of recreational outdoor activities such as camping in remote areas. It is difficult to estimate how many people practice open defecation in these communities. The practice of open defecation is strongly related to poverty and exclusion particularly, in the case of rural areas and informal urban settlements in developing countries . The Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) of UNICEF and WHO has been collecting data regarding open defecation prevalence worldwide. The figures are segregated by rural and urban areas and by levels of poverty. This program is tasked to monitor progress towards the millennium development goal (MDG) relating to drinking water and sanitation. As open defecation is one example of unimproved sanitation , it is being monitored by JMP for each country, and results are published on a regular basis. [28] [6] The figures on open defecation used to be lumped together with other figures on unimproved sanitation but are collected separately since 2010. The current estimate is that around 673 million people practice open defecation. [5] : 74 The number of people practicing open defecation fell from 20 percent in 2000 to 12 percent in 2015. [6] : 34 In 2016, the estimate was for 892 million people with no sanitation facility whatsoever and therefore practicing open defecation (in gutters, behind bushes, in open water bodies, etc.). Most people (9 of 10) who practice open defecation live in rural areas, but the vast majority lives in two regions ( Central Africa and South Asia ). [6] In 2016, seventy-six percent (678 million) of the 892 million people practicing open defecation in the world lived in just seven countries.

Those countries where open defecation is most widely practiced have the highest numbers of deaths of children under the age of five, as well as high levels of malnourishment (leading to stunted growth in children), high levels of poverty, and large disparities between rich and poor. [3] Research from India has shown that detrimental health impacts (particularly for early life health) are even more significant from open defecation when the population density is high: \"The same amount of open defecation is twice as bad in a place with a high population density average like India versus a low population density average like sub-Saharan Africa.\" [74] Open defecation is also badly affecting the health of children and their life quality as it creates health and psychological issues. [75] There are strong gender impacts connected with a lack of adequate sanitation. In addition to the universal problems associated with open defecation, having to urinate in the open can also be problematic for females. The lack of safe, private toilets makes women and girls vulnerable to violence and is an impediment to girls' education. [76] Women are at risk of sexual molestation and rape as they search for places to urinate or defecate that are secluded and private, often during hours of darkness. [77] [76] Lack of privacy has an especially large effect on the safety and sense of dignity of women and girls in developing countries. They face the shame of having to urinate or defecate in public so often wait until nightfall to relieve themselves. They risk being attacked after dark, though it means painfully holding their bladder and bowels all day. [78] [79] Women in developing countries increasingly express fear of assault or rape when having to leave the house after dark. Reports of attacks or harassment near or in toilet facilities, as well as near or in areas where women urinate or defecate openly, are common. [78] [79] The following joint strategies can enable communities, both rural and peri-urban , to become completely open defecation free and remain so: Sanitation marketing, behavior change communication , and 'enhanced' community-led total sanitation ('CLTS + \u2019), supplemented by 'nudging'. [26] There are several drivers used to eradicate open defecation, one of which is behavior change. SaniFOAM (Focus on Opportunity, Ability, and Motivation) is a conceptual framework that was developed specifically to address issues of sanitation and hygiene. Using focus, opportunity, ability and motivation as categories of determinants, SaniFOAM model identifies barriers to latrine adoption while simultaneously serving as a tool for designing, monitoring and evaluating sanitation interventions. [80] [81] The following are some of the key drivers used to fight against open defecation in addition to behavior change: [4] Political will Sanitation solutions that offer a better value than open defecation Stronger public sector local service delivery systems Creation of the right incentive structures Efforts to reduce open defecation are more or less the same as those to achieve the MDG target on access to sanitation . [82] A key aspect is awareness-raising (for example via the UN World Toilet Day at a global level), behavior change campaigns, increasing political will as well as demand for sanitation. Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) campaigns have placed a particular focus on ending open defecation by \"triggering\" the communities themselves into action. [83] There are some simple sanitation technology options available to reduce open defecation prevalence if the open defecation behavior is due to not having toilets in the household and shared toilets being too far or too dangerous to reach, e.g., at night. People might already use plastic bags (also called flying toilets ) at night to contain their feces. However, a more advanced solution of the plastic toilet bag has been provided by the Swedish company People who are producing the \"Peepoo bag\", a \"personal, single-use, self-sanitizing, fully biodegradable toilet that prevents feces from contaminating the immediate area as well as the surrounding ecosystem\". [84] This bag is now being used in humanitarian responses, schools, and urban slums in developing countries. [85] [86] Bucket toilets are a simple portable toilet option. They can be upgraded in various ways, one of them being urine diversion which can make them similar to urine-diverting dry toilets . Urine diversion can significantly reduce odors from dry toilets . Examples of using this type of toilet to reduce open defecation are the \"MoSan\" [87] toilet (used in Kenya) or the urine-diverting dry toilet promoted by SOIL [88] in Haiti. The mainstream media in some affected countries have recently been picking up on this issue of open defecation, for example, in India [89] [90] and Pakistan. [91] [92] [93] In certain jurisdictions, open or public defecation is a criminal offense which can be punished with a fine or even imprisonment. [94] [95] [96] David Sedaris ' essay \"Adventures at Poo Corner\" dealt with people who openly defecate in commercial businesses. [97] Some national parks prohibit open defecation in some areas. [98] [99] If defecating openly, the general advice is to defecate into a dug hole, and cover with soil.

Their house, like hundreds of millions of others in the country, did not have any facilities. A new World Health Organisation (WHO) report says more than half a billion people in India still \"continue to defecate in gutters, behind bushes or in open water bodies, with no dignity or privacy\". Access to sanitation is a challenge that India's politicians want to tackle - both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) promised to put an end to open defecation in their 2014 general election manifestos. During his campaign, Narendra Modi, BJP's newly-elected prime minister, promised: \"Toilets first, temples later\". And former rural development minister Jairam Ramesh of the Congress party had stressed that \"practicing good hygiene is as important as performing good puja\" (act of worship in Hinduism). India's government offers cash incentives to subsidise construction of toilets. It has also initiated hygiene and sanitation awareness campaigns, such as the \"No Toilet, No Bride\" slogan launched in the state of Haryana in 2005, urging brides to reject a groom if he did not have a lavatory at home. The Gates Foundation too has offered grants to create latrines that are not connected to water, sewer or electricity and to improve the treatment of human waste. The exhibits at a recent \"toilet fair\" organised by the Foundation in Delhi included a lavatory with a photovoltaic roof-top that powers a reactor breaking down excrements into fertiliser, and another one which came equipped with an automatic sterilisation system and a generator turning the moisture into water. Apart from poverty and lack of lavatories, one of the reasons often cited to explain open defecation in India is the ingrained cultural norm making the practice socially accepted in some parts of the society. \"Just building toilets is not going to solve the problem, because open defecation is a practice acquired from the time you learn how to walk. When you grow up in an environment where everyone does it, even if later in life you have access to proper sanitation, you will revert back to it,\" says Sue Coates, chief of Wash (water, sanitation and hygiene) at Unicef. India will be free of open defecation only when \"every Indian household, every village, every part of Indian society will accept the need to use toilets and commit to do so\", she says. Professor at the Centre for Environmental Planning and Technology Meera Mehta says the strategies implemented so far may not have the expected impact because of a \"lack of focus\". \"With the right policies and political attention, India can be free from open defecation within 10 years.", "documentFile": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-27775327"}, {"source_title": "Half of India couldn't access a toilet 5 years ago.

These lead to skin, lung, and throat irritation, and also prevent chlorine from working. I know, sort of like a chicken and egg problem. But you can clear your pool of chloramines by shocking it... ah, but here I am spoiling my own article. Next, I\u2019ll explain how to fix that cloudy water. Okay, enough diagnosing\u2014I think you get the point. Now that you understand the underlying causes of cloudiness (and yes, oftentimes one of these issues will lead to the others), you can come back to your DIY pool maintenance routine with renewed knowledge to keep your water flowing safely. Now, let\u2019s blast out that cloudiness\u2014for it to never return again. High five. Even without blockage, is your pool water barely moving? If a larger horsepower will turn over your water volume at a sufficient rate\u2014and won\u2019t overwhelm your filtration system\u2014then a more powerful unit like this Blue Torrent 2 HP Variable-Speed Pump is the one to try. As customer Bill Britton says, \u201cRuns great. Super quiet.\u201d First, let\u2019s knock out the grunt work\u2014it\u2019ll make the rest of the steps here all the more effective. Scrub your pool floors and walls using a brush like the patented 360-Degree Bristles Pool Brush, which was developed by pool maintenance experts to help get tight corners without any of the aches or pains associated with a good clean. Once you\u2019ve scrub-a-dubbed, remove large debris like leaves and twigs with a skimmer net on a telescopic pole, and vacuum\u2014or, if you\u2019ve invested for the long haul, turn on your robotic pool cleaner. If algae is the culprit in your pool, make sure you vacuum to waste or clean out your robotic cleaner immediately. That\u2019s the kind of gunk you DON\u2019T want ever circulating back out. No, thank you. If there was ever a time (and by the way, that time is usually once a week), it\u2019s now. Go ahead and shock your pool to get rid of the excess chloramines \u2014and keep it simple with affordable and effective shock conveniently sectioned into 1 lb. bags . This will also sort out the cloudiness caused by bacteria, algae, and other contaminants. If you\u2019re dealing with algae, get ready to double or even triple the amount of shock you\u2019re using\u2014and wait for your water to clear up before swimming, which could take about a day. But at least you know how long it\u2019ll take ahead of time, and can get to other tasks\u2014sorry, DMV, jury duty, and every other bureaucratic holding cell. Oh, pool filter... where would we be without you? For clearing up cloudy water, this part of your pool\u2019s greater circulation system is huge. Give it the boost that it needs by deep cleaning it out by backwashing your filter (or if you have a cartridge filter, cleaning the cartridge), or replacing your filter media before running it again\u2014and the best time to do this is after you\u2019ve shocked your pool to make sure the extra sanitizer has reached your filter. Is water not pushing through your filter properly because your pump\u2019s flow rate is weak? Try a booster pump like the dual-voltage Universal Booster Pump to increase performance. According to customer Jerad Wilson, \u201cGreat pump, quick delivery, and great pricing. Would buy from here again.\u201d Make sure that any debris that your vacuum missed is properly flushed out by turning on your bottom drains, and wave that gunk goodbye. If you have a super-efficient robotic cleamer like the Blue Torrent MyBot In-Ground Robotic Pool Cleaner , you can probably skip this step. Only an in-ground pool has bottom drains, but if you have a manual pool vacuum, you can flip it over on the center of the bottom of your pool to suck out debris that way instead. Nice trick, huh? Now that you\u2019ve blasted away the cloudy-bearing bacteria, it\u2019s time to make sure it\u2019s real by checking your water chemical levels with test strips. If you find that you\u2019re off, make the necessary adjustments and finish off the job. Except for built-up debris, the causes for cloudy water all go back to the chemical balance of your pool water\u2014and even with debris hidden inside your pipes or pump, if you tested your pool water frequently, you\u2019d know there was an issue before you realized your pool looked murky. I\u2019m always happy to help, but it would be great to never see you on this page again. Now that you\u2019ve tracked the cause of your murky pool and followed the necessary steps, your water is effectively reset\u2014and this is the kind of blank slate any pool owner can get used to. The only clouds you have to worry about from here on out are the ones in the sky. Enjoy.

backyard feature. When pool water is cloudy, the pool is much less appealing. Cloudy pool water is common, but it\u2019s is easy to correct. Clear water is essential for safe swimming and to keep your pool working correctly.\nThis guide will teach you how to clear a cloudy pool. It includes some of the most common causes of cloudiness and several ways to return the sparkle to your pool water.\nJump to Specific Section\n1\nWhen pool water is cloudy, you may wonder why. Pool chemicals could be out of balance or the pH might be off. Chlorine levels and the right pH are key to keeping a pool clear.\nIf a pool\u2019s pump or the filter isn\u2019t working right, the water may look murkier than usual. Storms or increased rainfall can affect your pool. So can too much sunlight, which can heat up the pool, allowing more bacteria to grow. The sun\u2019s ultraviolet rays can break down a pool\u2019s chlorine, resulting in lower levels of this chemical. Even having a lot of people over to swim might lead to a cloudy pool.\n2\nWhen pool water is cloudy, start by looking at the pool filter . It\u2019s designed to clear excess dirt and debris from the water. Dirty filters can leave trace amounts of particles in your water, leading to a foggy pool.\n- Use a pool brush to sweep the area near your filter.\n- Then inspect the filter to make sure it is both clean and functioning properly.\n- Clean your filter at least twice a year to help it perform at its best.\nFaulty or failing filters may have issues with their valves. It\u2019s possible that the filter cartridge may need to be replaced. If this is your first time using the pool, check to see if the filter is correctly installed.\nTo treat cloudy water due to poor filtration:\n- Check your filter for worn or broken parts. Replace parts if necessary.\n- Run the pump for at least 8 hours a day. Angle pool returns away from the water's surface.\n- Backwash the filter until a clear stream of water flows.\n- Chemically clean your filter media with a filter cleaner.\n- Empty any debris in the skimmer basket that may clog water flow.\nTip: Replace the cartridge in your pool filter at least once each season for the best performance.\n3\nIf your filter is clean and working properly, the next step is to measure the chemical levels of the water. Pool test kits are designed to evaluate the total chlorine in the pool, its alkalinity, the water hardness and more. The test results can help you determine how to clear cloudy pool water.\nChlorine levels should stay between 1 to 3 parts per million (ppm). Sunlight, rain and regular usage can deplete the amount of chlorine in your pool, leading to cloudy water. If your test strip or test kit shows the amount is less than 1.0 ppm, more chlorine is needed.\n4\nPool test kits also measure the potential hydrogen (pH) of your pool, which refers to how acidic or alkaline the water is on a scale of 0-14.\nPure water has a pH of 7.0, which is neutral. The pH of a pool should be between 7.2 and 7.8, with 7.6 being the ideal balance. Levels below 7.0 indicate acidic water. Levels above 7.8 mean that the water is too alkaline or basic. Both instances can lead to a cloudy pool. A pH adjuster can increase or decrease the pool's pH as needed.\n5\nAdding chlorine to a pool can lower the pH of the water. When you test your pool\u2019s pH, you may find that it is lower than the ideal of between 7.2 and 7.8. A pool with low pH will also have low alkalinity.\nTo increase the pH, you can amend the pool water with a product to raise its alkalinity or by adding sodium bicarbonate, also known as baking soda. The pH of baking soda is 8, which means it is alkaline.\nHow to clear a cloudy pool with baking soda:\n- Test your pool\u2019s alkalinity. It should be between 110 and 115 parts per million (ppm). If the test shows it is less than 80 ppm, you need to raise the level.\n- You\u2019ll need pounds of baking soda, which is a lot more than the small box you might have in a kitchen cabinet. The amount of baking soda you add will depend on the size of your pool and how low the alkalinity is.\n- Calculate how much baking soda to add. For 10,000 gallons of water, 1.5 pounds of baking soda will raise the alkalinity by 10 ppm.\n- For a 10,000-gallon pool that has a pH of lower than 7.2, between 3 to 4 pounds of baking soda should be enough to raise the levels.\n- Start by using about half of the amount of baking soda that you think you should use. Test the water afterward to see if you need to put in more baking soda. If you add too much, you may end up needing to make your pool water more acidic.\n- Baking soda is a powder than you can shake directly into the water. Move around to scatter the baking soda across the pool. Don\u2019t drop all of it in one place. The best time to add baking soda to a pool is on a calm day. If it\u2019s windy, the baking soda will blow away before it hits the water.\n- Use your pool\u2019s circulation system to help move the powder through the water for at least an hour.\n- After adding the baking soda, let at least six hours pass. Your pool water may look even more cloudy for a while. Allow time for the baking soda to dissolve.\n- Test your pool water again between six and 24 hours after you put the baking soda into your pool. You can use test strips or a test kit.\n- You may need to drop in additional baking soda if the pool pH is still under 7.2 and the alkalinity is less than 110 ppm.\n- Pool tablets that can be added to your pool to keep the pH and alkalinity levels in the right place are also available.\n6\nAs you learn how to clear cloudy pool water, cleaning the filter and adjusting the chemical levels may not solve the problem.

When pool water is cloudy, the pool is much less appealing. Cloudy pool water is common, but it\u2019s is easy to correct. Clear water is essential for safe swimming and to keep your pool working correctly. This guide will teach you how to clear a cloudy pool. It includes some of the most common causes of cloudiness and several ways to return the sparkle to your pool water. Jump to Specific Section 1 When pool water is cloudy, you may wonder why. Pool chemicals could be out of balance or the pH might be off. Chlorine levels and the right pH are key to keeping a pool clear. If a pool\u2019s pump or the filter isn\u2019t working right, the water may look murkier than usual. Storms or increased rainfall can affect your pool. So can too much sunlight, which can heat up the pool, allowing more bacteria to grow. The sun\u2019s ultraviolet rays can break down a pool\u2019s chlorine, resulting in lower levels of this chemical. Even having a lot of people over to swim might lead to a cloudy pool. 2 When pool water is cloudy, start by looking at the pool filter . It\u2019s designed to clear excess dirt and debris from the water. Dirty filters can leave trace amounts of particles in your water, leading to a foggy pool. Use a pool brush to sweep the area near your filter. Then inspect the filter to make sure it is both clean and functioning properly. Clean your filter at least twice a year to help it perform at its best. Faulty or failing filters may have issues with their valves. It\u2019s possible that the filter cartridge may need to be replaced. If this is your first time using the pool, check to see if the filter is correctly installed. To treat cloudy water due to poor filtration: Check your filter for worn or broken parts. Replace parts if necessary. Run the pump for at least 8 hours a day. Angle pool returns away from the water's surface. Backwash the filter until a clear stream of water flows. Chemically clean your filter media with a filter cleaner. Empty any debris in the skimmer basket that may clog water flow. Tip: Replace the cartridge in your pool filter at least once each season for the best performance. 3 If your filter is clean and working properly, the next step is to measure the chemical levels of the water. Pool test kits are designed to evaluate the total chlorine in the pool, its alkalinity, the water hardness and more. The test results can help you determine how to clear cloudy pool water. Chlorine levels should stay between 1 to 3 parts per million (ppm). Sunlight, rain and regular usage can deplete the amount of chlorine in your pool, leading to cloudy water. If your test strip or test kit shows the amount is less than 1.0 ppm, more chlorine is needed. 4 Pool test kits also measure the potential hydrogen (pH) of your pool, which refers to how acidic or alkaline the water is on a scale of 0-14. Pure water has a pH of 7.0, which is neutral. The pH of a pool should be between 7.2 and 7.8, with 7.6 being the ideal balance. Levels below 7.0 indicate acidic water. Levels above 7.8 mean that the water is too alkaline or basic. Both instances can lead to a cloudy pool. A pH adjuster can increase or decrease the pool's pH as needed. 5 Adding chlorine to a pool can lower the pH of the water. When you test your pool\u2019s pH, you may find that it is lower than the ideal of between 7.2 and 7.8. A pool with low pH will also have low alkalinity. To increase the pH, you can amend the pool water with a product to raise its alkalinity or by adding sodium bicarbonate, also known as baking soda. The pH of baking soda is 8, which means it is alkaline. How to clear a cloudy pool with baking soda: Test your pool\u2019s alkalinity. It should be between 110 and 115 parts per million (ppm). If the test shows it is less than 80 ppm, you need to raise the level. You\u2019ll need pounds of baking soda, which is a lot more than the small box you might have in a kitchen cabinet. The amount of baking soda you add will depend on the size of your pool and how low the alkalinity is. Calculate how much baking soda to add. For 10,000 gallons of water, 1.5 pounds of baking soda will raise the alkalinity by 10 ppm. For a 10,000-gallon pool that has a pH of lower than 7.2, between 3 to 4 pounds of baking soda should be enough to raise the levels. Start by using about half of the amount of baking soda that you think you should use. Test the water afterward to see if you need to put in more baking soda. If you add too much, you may end up needing to make your pool water more acidic. Baking soda is a powder than you can shake directly into the water. Move around to scatter the baking soda across the pool. Don\u2019t drop all of it in one place. The best time to add baking soda to a pool is on a calm day. If it\u2019s windy, the baking soda will blow away before it hits the water. Use your pool\u2019s circulation system to help move the powder through the water for at least an hour. After adding the baking soda, let at least six hours pass. Your pool water may look even more cloudy for a while. Allow time for the baking soda to dissolve. Test your pool water again between six and 24 hours after you put the baking soda into your pool. You can use test strips or a test kit. You may need to drop in additional baking soda if the pool pH is still under 7.2 and the alkalinity is less than 110 ppm. Pool tablets that can be added to your pool to keep the pH and alkalinity levels in the right place are also available. 6 As you learn how to clear cloudy pool water, cleaning the filter and adjusting the chemical levels may not solve the problem. You may need to clarify the pool. Clarifying tablets and solvents can get rid of micro particles and excess debris. Algaecides are designed to remove trace amounts of algae from the water. Choose a pool clarifier that requires minimal mixing or measuring. Many are designed to work within 24 hours and are compatible with universal filters.

Check out our pool filter cleaning walkthrough for more help.\n- Your skimmer basket or pump basket is full of debris. Remove any leaves, twigs, or other debris in your skimmer or pump basket. If you\u2019re frequently finding debris in your circulation system, take a look at our pool skimmer troubleshooting guide .\n- Your pool filter media needs replacing. If your filter media is worn out or damaged, it won\u2019t be able to capture contaminants that cause cloudy water. So every 5 years, change your filter sand or replace your cartridge filters every 2-3 years. If you have a D.E. filter, add fresh diatomaceous earth powder or replace your D.E. grids.\n- You\u2019re not running your filter long enough. To fix a cloudy pool, all of your pool water must run through the filter system at least once a day. You need to run your filter system for at least 8 to 12 hours a day .\n- Your pool pump or filter needs replacing.

Chlorine levels can drop if there\u2019s lots of debris like leaves in your pool.\nAlso, if there\u2019s a build-up of bodily contaminants like sweat or sunscreen, or if your water is exposed to the sun\u2019s UV rays and your chlorine is not properly stabilized.\nSOLUTION: Test your free chlorine and combined chlorine levels, add shock to rebalance your chlorine levels, and add cyanuric acid to stabilize a sun-exposed pool.\n- Test your free chlorine levels. \u201cFree Chlorine\u201d is the amount of chlorine that\u2019s available to sanitize your pool water. If these levels are low, you don\u2019t have enough chlorine working in your water. To test for free chlorine, use test strips, a liquid test kit, or take a sample to your local pool supply store. If you have a chlorine or salt water pool, your free chlorine and combined chlorine should read between 1 and 3 ppm (parts per million).\n- Calculate your combined chlorine levels. If your free chlorine levels are lower than your total chlorine levels, you can end up with chloramines. Chloramines are the byproduct of chlorine sanitizing which can be irritating and even corrosive. Your Combined Chlorine is the difference between your Free Chlorine reading and the Total Chlorine reading . Your combined chlorine should be below 0.5 ppm.\n- Shock your pool with cal-hypo shock. To quickly bump up your free chlorine levels and remove chloramines, shock your pool using calcium hypochlorite shock. Calcium hypochlorite should be the main active ingredient in your pool shock (around 60 to 80%). Shocking your pool once per week during peak pool season refreshes your sanitizer levels and prevents cloudy water. If you need more help using shock, check out our guide on how to use pool shock .\n- Test and add cyanuric acid if needed. Make sure you have the proper levels of cyanuric acid or CYA in your water. This will help prevent the sun\u2019s UV rays from breaking down your chlorine too quickly. Your CYA levels should be between 30 and 50 ppm. Be sure to read our guide on how to balance your cyanuric acid levels .\nHigh levels of pH, Total Alkalinity, and Calcium Hardness can form scale on your pool surfaces and inside your plumbing. This can lead to pool filtration, bacteria growth, and cloudy water. And poor water chemistry makes it more difficult for your chlorine to function well and kill contaminants.\nSOLUTION: Test and balance your pH, total alkalinity, and calcium hardness levels.\nThe proper pool water chemistry levels are:\n- pH: 7.4 to 7.6.\n- Alkalinity: 100 parts per million (ppm) to 150 ppm, with 125 ppm being ideal.\n- Calcium Hardness: 175 ppm to 225 ppm for vinyl liner pools, or 200 ppm to 275 ppm for concrete and plaster pools.\n- Test and balance your Total Alkalinity (TA) levels. Your alkalinity helps prevent fluctuations in your pH, so you\u2019ll want to adjust these levels first. High alkalinity levels can cause pH and calcium scaling, which can cause cloudy water. To lower your alkalinity levels, use muriatic acid or a pH decreaser. To raise your alkalinity levels, use an alkalinity increaser or baking soda.\n- Test and balance your pH levels . Improper pH levels can affect your chlorine and the other chemicals in your water. High levels of pH can cause calcium build-up and scaling which leads to cloudy pool water. Low levels of pH can cause your chlorine to become overly reactive and quickly depleted. This means it\u2019s less effective at sanitizing, leading to a build-up of contaminants and cloudy pool water. You can lower your pH levels with a pH decreaser. You can raise your pH with a pH increaser or soda ash. If you want more help balancing your pH and total alkalinity, check out our complete guide to basic pool water chemistry .\n- Test and balance your Calcium Hardness levels. High calcium hardness levels can cause calcium build-up and scale inside your pool plumbing and equipment. This creates a cloudy pool water problem that\u2019s not easy to fix. If you have high calcium hardness levels, the only thing you can do is dilute your pool water. Partially drain your pool and refill with fresh water from a garden hose filter. Just remember that diluting your pool water will affect all of your water chemistry levels, so you\u2019ll need to test your water again. For more help, check out our guide on how to balance your calcium hardness levels .\nContaminants, particles, and small debris in your pool can cause cloudy water. This is especially common during the springtime. Early-stage algae growth may also cause cloudy pool water.\nSOLUTION: Treat algae in its early stages by cleaning and shocking your pool. Test, balance, and clean your water after a rainstorm or when debris or pollen accumulates in your pool.\n- Treat algae. If you already have visible algae growth, you\u2019ll need to get rid of your algae problem before you treat your cloudy pool water. Unfortunately, algaecide won\u2019t solve the problem. It\u2019s better as a preventative measure, not a treatment. To remove algae, you\u2019ll need to skim, brush, and vacuum your pool. Be sure to bypass the filter by vacuuming on the waste setting. Then, you\u2019ll want to shock your pool. If you need a step-by-step tutorial on getting rid of algae, check out our guide on how to get rid of algae in your pool.\n- Test, balance, and clean your pool after a rainstorm. Storms can blow dirt and debris into your pool and the rain can dilute your pool water. That means your chlorine levels can drop, which we know can lead to cloudy water. Test and balance your water after a rainstorm and skim, brush, and vacuum the pool as needed. If you need to lower your water level, follow this guide on how to drain water from your pool after rain.\nTired of cloudy water and want to learn how to never deal with this problem again?

Point your return jet(s) down at a 45\u00b0 angle and all in the same direction. This will help churn the cloudy water up from the bottom of the pool to the top where your main skimmer can get it into your filter system.\n- Use your bottom drains. If you have an inground pool, make sure the main drain at the bottom is on and is pulling water from the bottom of the pool into your filter system. This will speed up filtering and clear the pool water faster.\n- Turn your vacuum upside down. If you have an above ground pool with no main drain, you can hook up your manual vacuum cleaner and turn it upside down at the bottom of the pool to mimic a bottom main drain.\nAfter your pool water has circulated and your shock has dissipated, it\u2019s time to add your clarifier.

Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how to fix these common issues, and how to clear up a cloudy pool fast using a clarifier or flocculant. You can watch the quick video tutorial below. Or keep reading for the complete cloudy pool water troubleshooting guide. Poor filtration, low chlorine levels, poor water chemistry, and outside contaminants cause cloudy water. Here\u2019s how to troubleshoot each one of these issues. Filter problems are the main cause of cloudy pool water. If your filter isn\u2019t functioning properly, then it can\u2019t remove the tiny contaminants that cause cloudy pool water. SOLUTION: Keep your pool\u2019s circulation system flowing with regular cleaning, maintenance, and run times. Check for the following filtration issues: Your pool filter has a clog or build-up. If you haven\u2019t cleaned your filter in a while, it\u2019s time to backwash your sand or D.E. filter, clean your D.E. filter grids, or clean the cartridge in your filter. Check out our pool filter cleaning walkthrough for more help. Your skimmer basket or pump basket is full of debris. Remove any leaves, twigs, or other debris in your skimmer or pump basket. If you\u2019re frequently finding debris in your circulation system, take a look at our pool skimmer troubleshooting guide . Your pool filter media needs replacing. If your filter media is worn out or damaged, it won\u2019t be able to capture contaminants that cause cloudy water. So every 5 years, change your filter sand or replace your cartridge filters every 2-3 years. If you have a D.E. filter, add fresh diatomaceous earth powder or replace your D.E. grids. You\u2019re not running your filter long enough. To fix a cloudy pool, all of your pool water must run through the filter system at least once a day. You need to run your filter system for at least 8 to 12 hours a day . Your pool pump or filter needs replacing. As it gets older, your pool filter system can start to fail and you may need to replace major pieces of equipment. Pathogens, bacteria, and cloudy water form when there\u2019s not enough chlorine to sanitize your water . Chlorine levels can drop if there\u2019s lots of debris like leaves in your pool. Also, if there\u2019s a build-up of bodily contaminants like sweat or sunscreen, or if your water is exposed to the sun\u2019s UV rays and your chlorine is not properly stabilized. SOLUTION: Test your free chlorine and combined chlorine levels, add shock to rebalance your chlorine levels, and add cyanuric acid to stabilize a sun-exposed pool. Test your free chlorine levels. \u201cFree Chlorine\u201d is the amount of chlorine that\u2019s available to sanitize your pool water. If these levels are low, you don\u2019t have enough chlorine working in your water. To test for free chlorine, use test strips, a liquid test kit, or take a sample to your local pool supply store. If you have a chlorine or salt water pool, your free chlorine and combined chlorine should read between 1 and 3 ppm (parts per million). Calculate your combined chlorine levels. If your free chlorine levels are lower than your total chlorine levels, you can end up with chloramines. Chloramines are the byproduct of chlorine sanitizing which can be irritating and even corrosive. Your Combined Chlorine is the difference between your Free Chlorine reading and the Total Chlorine reading . Your combined chlorine should be below 0.5 ppm. Shock your pool with cal-hypo shock. To quickly bump up your free chlorine levels and remove chloramines, shock your pool using calcium hypochlorite shock. Calcium hypochlorite should be the main active ingredient in your pool shock (around 60 to 80%). Shocking your pool once per week during peak pool season refreshes your sanitizer levels and prevents cloudy water. If you need more help using shock, check out our guide on how to use pool shock . Test and add cyanuric acid if needed. Make sure you have the proper levels of cyanuric acid or CYA in your water. This will help prevent the sun\u2019s UV rays from breaking down your chlorine too quickly. Your CYA levels should be between 30 and 50 ppm. Be sure to read our guide on how to balance your cyanuric acid levels . High levels of pH, Total Alkalinity, and Calcium Hardness can form scale on your pool surfaces and inside your plumbing. This can lead to pool filtration, bacteria growth, and cloudy water. And poor water chemistry makes it more difficult for your chlorine to function well and kill contaminants. SOLUTION: Test and balance your pH, total alkalinity, and calcium hardness levels. The proper pool water chemistry levels are: pH: 7.4 to 7.6. Alkalinity: 100 parts per million (ppm) to 150 ppm, with 125 ppm being ideal. Calcium Hardness: 175 ppm to 225 ppm for vinyl liner pools, or 200 ppm to 275 ppm for concrete and plaster pools. Test and balance your Total Alkalinity (TA) levels. Your alkalinity helps prevent fluctuations in your pH, so you\u2019ll want to adjust these levels first. High alkalinity levels can cause pH and calcium scaling, which can cause cloudy water. To lower your alkalinity levels, use muriatic acid or a pH decreaser. To raise your alkalinity levels, use an alkalinity increaser or baking soda. Test and balance your pH levels . Improper pH levels can affect your chlorine and the other chemicals in your water. High levels of pH can cause calcium build-up and scaling which leads to cloudy pool water. Low levels of pH can cause your chlorine to become overly reactive and quickly depleted. This means it\u2019s less effective at sanitizing, leading to a build-up of contaminants and cloudy pool water. You can lower your pH levels with a pH decreaser.

Pull out your handy pool testing kit, whether it is a set of pool test strips or a digital tester for pools , and check the free chlorine levels.\n- Shock the water . Shocking the water is a simple matter of adding enough chlorine to the pool to drop-kick all the bacteria and chloramines causing cloudy water. Pool shocks temporarily raise the chlorine levels to kill off contaminants.\nOnce this is done, let the pool pump circulate the water and sit back poolside for a few hours.\nIn the future, load up some chlorine tablets either in your basket skimmer or in a floating chlorine dispenser to ensure that your pool is getting the cleaning it requires.\nWhile we have that pool test kit out, we may as well take a gander at the other key markers of pool water health.\nThese include:\n- pH . When the pH is off, it can affect how well your pool chemicals are functioning. Look for a pH in the range of 7.4 to 7.6.\n- Alkalinity . This measure tells you how well pH is being stabilized, so it is usually the first thing you want to look at when testing the water. Most above-ground pools , which are made of vinyl, should have a range of 100-140.\n- Calcium hardness . If calcium levels are too high, this can cause structural integrity problems with the plumbing and equipment in the pool.

much as a finger.", "\nInstead, the decisive result came at Old Trafford, where an under-strength Manchester United fell 2-1 against Leicester City , ensuring that City's 10-point lead at the summit is now unassailable.", "\nIt is also the second time in recent history that a Manchester City title win has been decided at Old Trafford, after United's shock home defeat against West Bromwich Albion in 2017-18 confirmed Pep Guardiola's side as champions.", "\nCity now have five Premier League titles tucked neatly under their belt, all of which have come within the last 10 years -- including three in the last four.\n", "Here's a look at those five triumphs, how they unfolded, the major moments and how they rank when stacked against each other.", "\nAfter seeing Liverpool run away with things the previous year, City faced the daunting task of playing catch-up with Jurgen Klopp's gegenpressing buccaneers.", "Things hardly got off to the perfect start, as Guardiola's side found themselves wallowing in mid-table after the first few months of the season.", "After winning just three of their opening eight games, City were down in 13th place in mid-November having mustered fewer league goals than at any stage since 2006.", "They clambered up to eighth place by Christmas, the lowest rung that any subsequent Premier League champions have ever occupied on Dec. 25.\nHowever, as injuries took a heavy toll on the prospects of Klopp's defending champions, Guardiola's side soon began to jell as the magic began to course through their collective veins once again.", "It wasn't always 100% convincing, but City put together a formidable streak of 27 wins in 28 matches in all competitions as they clawed their way back to the light despite playing with no discernible first-choice striker.", "\nAt the point at which they were crowned champions, Ilkay Gundogan was the club's top scorer in the league (12 goals), with Raheem Sterling the only other play to reach 10 goals for the campaign.", "Riyad Mahrez (9), Gabriel Jesus (8) and young midfielder Phil Foden (7) are next on the list as City favoured the \"share and share alike\" approach over funnelling the goals through a main striker.", "Indeed, club legend Sergio Aguero mustered just two goals in 11 appearances after seeing his involvement hampered by injury, a bout of COVID-19 and demotion down the pecking order in what is to be his final season at the Etihad.\n", "During a thrilling Premier League campaign in which the lead changed hands 25 times, City emerged victorious on the final day despite having only been top of the table for a total of 15 days.", "\nManuel Pellegrini's side scored 102 league goals, just one short of the record, with Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Yaya Toure doing a lot of the heavy lifting.", "Toure finished the season with 20 league goals to his name, as only Daniel Sturridge (21) and Luis Suarez (31) of Liverpool managed to better the City midfielder's impressive tally.", "\nIndeed, it was Brendan Rodgers' Reds who looked all but set to end the club's 24-year wait for a league championship, only for a costly Steven Gerrard slip and a dreadful capitulation against Crystal Palace in back-to-back games to allow City to nip above them at the buzzer.", "City overtook Liverpool in matchweek 37 thanks to a run of five consecutive victories, with their season culminating with a 2-0 win over West Ham that sealed a second Premier League title in three seasons.", "\nGuardiola broke new ground with City as his side became the first in English football history to complete a domestic treble of the league, FA Cup, and EFL Cup in one season.", "Seeking to defend their title, City found themselves seven points behind Liverpool at the turn of the year but eventually ate up that ground to retain the Premier League on the final day of the season.", "City finished top of the table on 98 points after winning their final 14 matches, thus ensuring the Reds ended the campaign in second despite losing only one game all season and amassing the third-highest points total (97) in Premier League history.", "\nThe defining moment of City's season came in the penultimate match when, presiding over a precarious one-point lead at the top, they almost came unstuck against a dogged Leicester City side that seemed intent on spoiling the fun.", "City and Liverpool had exchanged the lead 32 times heading into matchweek 37, with the former needing a victory against the Foxes to ensure they went into their final game at Brighton with a one-point lead and therefore in full control of their destiny.", "\nHowever, tensions soon reached an almost unbearable pitch as Guardiola's team repeatedly tried and failed to break down the Foxes' deep-lying defensive line.", "With 20 minutes remaining and City floundering, it looked like the pendulum might be about to swing back in Liverpool's favour.", "Then captain Vincent Kompany did something extraordinary.", "In what was to be one of his last appearances for City, the veteran Belgian centre-back unleashed chaos from 25 yards (despite Aguero's pleas) and clattered a thunderous shot in off the crossbar to set City back on course.", "Relieved of all pressure, Kompany & Co. went on to crush Brighton 4-1 in their last fixture of the season to bring home Premier League title No. 4.\nCity's third Premier League triumph saw them firmly establish their place at the pinnacle, with Guardiola masterminding not only a title win but also a mass obliteration of the record books.", "After finishing third the previous year, Guardiola's all-conquering team hit the ground running before going on to shatter numerous long-standing records, most notably becoming the first and so far only champions to amass 100 points from a single English top-flight season.", "\nThe Centurions of City won the league with five games to spare, ultimately sealing the title with the biggest winning margin in history (19 points) while also racking up the most overall wins (32), the most away wins (16), most goals scored (106), and highest-ever goal difference (+79).", "\nAguero led the scoring charts for City with 21 goals though Sterling also contributed his fair share, racking up 18 of his own in a strong individual season for the forward.", "Kevin De Bruyne led the league in assists (16) though the chart was

"rawDocumentText": "- Chris Wright, Toe Poke writerMay 12, 2021, 09:00 AM ET\nManchester City were crowned 2020-21 Premier League champions on Tuesday without having to lift so much as a finger.\nInstead, the decisive result came at Old Trafford, where an under-strength Manchester United fell 2-1 against Leicester City , ensuring that City's 10-point lead at the summit is now unassailable.\nIt is also the second time in recent history that a Manchester City title win has been decided at Old Trafford, after United's shock home defeat against West Bromwich Albion in 2017-18 confirmed Pep Guardiola's side as champions.\nCity now have five Premier League titles tucked neatly under their belt, all of which have come within the last 10 years -- including three in the last four.\nHere's a look at those five triumphs, how they unfolded, the major moments and how they rank when stacked against each other.\nAfter seeing Liverpool run away with things the previous year, City faced the daunting task of playing catch-up with Jurgen Klopp's gegenpressing buccaneers. Things hardly got off to the perfect start, as Guardiola's side found themselves wallowing in mid-table after the first few months of the season. After winning just three of their opening eight games, City were down in 13th place in mid-November having mustered fewer league goals than at any stage since 2006. They clambered up to eighth place by Christmas, the lowest rung that any subsequent Premier League champions have ever occupied on Dec. 25.\nHowever, as injuries took a heavy toll on the prospects of Klopp's defending champions, Guardiola's side soon began to jell as the magic began to course through their collective veins once again. It wasn't always 100% convincing, but City put together a formidable streak of 27 wins in 28 matches in all competitions as they clawed their way back to the light despite playing with no discernible first-choice striker.\nAt the point at which they were crowned champions, Ilkay Gundogan was the club's top scorer in the league (12 goals), with Raheem Sterling the only other play to reach 10 goals for the campaign. Riyad Mahrez (9), Gabriel Jesus (8) and young midfielder Phil Foden (7) are next on the list as City favoured the \"share and share alike\" approach over funnelling the goals through a main striker. Indeed, club legend Sergio Aguero mustered just two goals in 11 appearances after seeing his involvement hampered by injury, a bout of COVID-19 and demotion down the pecking order in what is to be his final season at the Etihad.\nDuring a thrilling Premier League campaign in which the lead changed hands 25 times, City emerged victorious on the final day despite having only been top of the table for a total of 15 days.\nManuel Pellegrini's side scored 102 league goals, just one short of the record, with Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Yaya Toure doing a lot of the heavy lifting. Toure finished the season with 20 league goals to his name, as only Daniel Sturridge (21) and Luis Suarez (31) of Liverpool managed to better the City midfielder's impressive tally.\nIndeed, it was Brendan Rodgers' Reds who looked all but set to end the club's 24-year wait for a league championship, only for a costly Steven Gerrard slip and a dreadful capitulation against Crystal Palace in back-to-back games to allow City to nip above them at the buzzer. City overtook Liverpool in matchweek 37 thanks to a run of five consecutive victories, with their season culminating with a 2-0 win over West Ham that sealed a second Premier League title in three seasons.\nGuardiola broke new ground with City as his side became the first in English football history to complete a domestic treble of the league, FA Cup, and EFL Cup in one season. Seeking to defend their title, City found themselves seven points behind Liverpool at the turn of the year but eventually ate up that ground to retain the Premier League on the final day of the season. City finished top of the table on 98 points after winning their final 14 matches, thus ensuring the Reds ended the campaign in second despite losing only one game all season and amassing the third-highest points total (97) in Premier League history.\nThe defining moment of City's season came in the penultimate match when, presiding over a precarious one-point lead at the top, they almost came unstuck against a dogged Leicester City side that seemed intent on spoiling the fun. City and Liverpool had exchanged the lead 32 times heading into matchweek 37, with the former needing a victory against the Foxes to ensure they went into their final game at Brighton with a one-point lead and therefore in full control of their destiny.\nHowever, tensions soon reached an almost unbearable pitch as Guardiola's team repeatedly tried and failed to break down the Foxes' deep-lying defensive line. With 20 minutes remaining and City floundering, it looked like the pendulum might be about to swing back in Liverpool's favour. Then captain Vincent Kompany did something extraordinary. In what was to be one of his last appearances for City, the veteran Belgian centre-back unleashed chaos from 25 yards (despite Aguero's pleas) and clattered a thunderous shot in off the crossbar to set City back on course. Relieved of all pressure, Kompany & Co. went on to crush Brighton 4-1 in their last fixture of the season to bring home Premier League title No. 4.\nCity's third Premier League triumph saw them firmly establish their place at the pinnacle, with Guardiola masterminding not only a title win but also a mass obliteration of the record books. After finishing third the previous year, Guardiola's all-conquering team hit the ground running before going on to shatter numerous long-standing records, most notably becoming the first and so far only champions to amass 100 points from a single English top-flight season.\nThe Centurions of City won the league with five games to spare, ultimately sealing the title with the biggest winning margin in history (19 points) while also racking up the most overall wins (32), the most away wins (16), most goals scored (106), and highest-ever goal difference (+79).\nAguero led the scoring charts for City with 21 goals though Sterling also contributed his fair share, racking up 18 of his own in a strong individual season for the forward. Kevin De Bruyne led the league in assists (16) though the chart was dominated by City players as Leroy Sane (15), David Silva (11) and Sterling (11) populated the next three slots overall.

Peaches have been grown and cultivated for an incredibly long time, and it\u2019s not surprising that people have loved this fruit for so long. Peaches are sweet, juicy, and perfectly delicious . A peach tree takes a bit of work to maintain, but if you have a sunny location and are willing to put in some time and effort, you can also have a peach tree of your own.\nPeach trees bloom in the spring, and many produce colorful and fragrant flowers. Flowers are \u00bd to 1 inch wide and quite showy, in beautiful shades of pink. Flowers can be quite abundant, and even if your tree didn\u2019t produce any fruits, the flowers themselves would be worth growing a peach tree. The flowers also attract bees and other pollinators.\nIf you want to try growing a peach tree in your own yard, read on to learn more about peach-growing basics. It\u2019s also a good idea to check with your local cooperative extension office for region-specific information about growing peaches in your area. The more you know, the more successfully you can grow.\nContents\nPeach Tree Overview\nPlant Type Fruit Tree\nFamily Rosaceae\nScientific Name Prunus persica\nNative Area China\nPlant Height (standard) 20 to 25 feet\nPlant Height (dwarf) 4 to 6 feet\nSeason Mid summer to Early fall\nBloom Time Spring\nHardiness Zones 4 to 9\nExposure Full Sun\nWatering Requirements Moderate\nPlant Spacing 18 to 24 feet\nTree Maturity 3 to 4 years\nGrowth Rate Moderate\nMaintenance High\nSoil Type Loamy, well-drained, fertile\nDiseases Bacterial spot, Peach leaf curl\nAttracts Bees, Butterflies\nPeach fruits are sweet, juicy, and colorful . The skin color varies from bright yellow to deep red-orange, usually within a single fruit. The inner flesh is very juicy, very sweet, and light orange in color, containing a single large pit in the center. Peaches are slightly fuzzy fruits, and nectarines are a non-fuzzy, smooth variety of peach.\nPeach trees are deciduous fruit-bearing trees that are native to China . The Chinese consider the peach to be a symbol of longevity and immortality. Peaches certainly do have a long history of use and cultivation . Based on historical evidence, it appears that peaches have been cultivated since prehistoric times on the Asian continent.\nPeaches were likely brought from Asia to Europe, where they were further cultivated. Evidence of ancient peaches has been found in China, Japan, India, and Greece.\nThey were then brought to the Americas in the 1600s. It\u2019s no wonder peaches have been around so long; they are a sweet and delicious fruit that\u2019s both healthy and easy to eat .\nPeach trees told today in nurseries are typically grafted . They use a hearty and vigorous rootstock and graft it to a known variety of peaches. The known variety is the type of peach you actually harvest. This way, both the seller and the buyer know exactly what variety of peach they are working with. Peaches grown from seed are less certain due to cross-pollination and genetic variation.\nPeaches can be grown as individual trees or as an entire orchard. A single mature peach tree can produce up to 150 pounds of fruit per year! All those peaches make tasty and nutritious snacks.\nThere are 20 states where peaches are grown commercially. Even though Georgia is known as \u201cThe Peach State,\u201d California is actually the leading US producer of peaches, followed by South Carolina, with Georgia coming in third.\nNot all peach varieties are suitable for just any location. The first thing to consider is which USDA hardiness zone you live in. That will limit your choices when selecting a peach variety to grow. You will need to select a variety that will grow well in your area.\nThese climate zones also help determine how many chill hours your tree will receive. Peaches won\u2019t bloom or fruit without the proper number of chill hours or the amount of time with temperatures below a certain threshold.\nOnce you know your climate zone, you can look at the tree varieties available to you. Some of the things you will need to consider are:\nSome fruiting trees require at least two varieties planted in close proximity to cross-pollinate and set fruit. Most peach trees are self-fertile and can, therefore, produce fruit without another peach tree nearby.\nIf you do happen to have space for two varieties, cross-pollination may still be a way to increase yield, as well as allow you to try multiple varieties of peach.\n- Bonfire Patio Peach : This is an example of a dwarf variety of peach. This plant grows just 4 to 6 feet tall and produces fruit in late summer. It grows in USDA zones 5 through 9 and requires only 400 chill hours to set fruit.\n- Crimson Princess Peach : This is a mid-sized peach tree that grows from 12 to 15 feet tall and produces fruit in early summer. It grows in USDA zones 5 through 9 and requires 650 chill hours to set fruit.\n- Early Elberta Peach : This is a full-size peach tree that grows from 15 to 25 feet tall and produces fruits in late summer. It grows in USDA zones 5 through 9 and requires 600 chill hours to set fruit.\nYou will need to select a healthy and vigorous plant that will grow well where you live. Buying plants in person will allow you the chance to inspect them yourself. If you plan to buy peach trees through mail-order, a bare-root stock will likely be sent to you. Just be sure to order from a reputable company!\nPlant your new peach tree in the winter months while it is dormant; this could be anywhere from November through April. Setting your plant in the ground as early as possible gives the roots a chance to grow before the buds and new leaves emerge.\nDig a hole large enough to accommodate the entire root mass. Carefully set the tree in the hole to the depth it has been growing as a nursery plant.\nDo not bury any extra length of trunk or underplant, leaving roots exposed. Push the soil up to the root mass at the proper depth and press the soil firmly into place to secure the tree in an upright position.\nIf you are planting more than one peach tree, give them each adequate space . Give standard-size varieties 18 to 20 feet and dwarf varieties 5 feet. This gives each tree enough sunlight and airflow, preventing fungal diseases.\nThoroughly water the tree and keep the soil moist , but not soggy, for the first few months. Keep an eye on your new tree so that if you catch any problems, you can correct them early.\nFinally, you will need to prune the tree back to about 3 feet tall and remove the side branches. This will ultimately help your tree grow into a sturdy compact form and produce a healthy crop of peaches.\nProper care of your new peach tree is pretty straightforward. Learn about the appropriate placement, preparation, and care of your tree before you plant it , so you will be prepared to offer your tree the best environment and the best care possible.\nPeach trees need full sun to grow, flower, and produce fruits. A tree grown in a shaded area will not be as healthy or as vigorous. If you don\u2019t have a large enough location that\u2019s full sun, it may be best not to try planting a peach.\nYoung trees should get approximately 1 to 1.5 inches of water per week. Rainfall may be enough if you live in an area with regular rain. If not, you will need to water or irrigate your peach tree. Ensure the water is soaking into the soil and not just running off the surface.\nAlso, make sure to water enough to make the soil moist without being saturated or squishy. A general rule of thumb is to try to keep the soil moist without allowing it to dry completely. Peach trees are pretty sensitive to drying out and will not produce fruits if they are too dry.\nOne of the most important things you can do to ensure a successful peach tree planting is to prepare the soil well in advance . Take the time to do this, and your newly planted tree will be off to the best start possible.\nPeach trees require well-drained soil in order to grow. Any waterlogged or saturated soil will cause the plant to die. The best soil for peach trees is one where the topsoil (to approximately the top 24 inches) is sandy or loamy and very well-drained. The topsoil and the subsoil should both be rich in organic matter and relatively fertile.\nSoil pH should be between 6.0 and 7.0. Peach trees will not do well in acidic soils. If your soil pH is below 6.0, you will need to add lime to help increase soil pH. Mix it well and continue soil testing until the proper pH is reached.\nAfter planting your peach tree, add a layer of mulch in a circle surrounding the tree but not covering the base of the tree. Avoid making a mounded pile of mulch that touches the trunk of the tree.\nFor mulch materials, you can use straw or hay, pine needles, leaves, grass clippings, or even compost. The mulch will help protect the newly planted tree from drying out and also help prevent weed growth around the base of the tree.\nYou can grow a peach tree in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 8 . Just check that the variety of peaches you select is hardy in your particular climate zone. There are peach varieties that are more cold-tolerant to zone 4 and more heat tolerant to zone 9, but these are less common.\nPeaches also need a certain number of chilling hours to successfully flower and produce fruits. Depending on the variety, peaches will most commonly require anywhere from 400 to 600 chill hours.\nThe best thing you can do to ensure you select the best tree for your area is to make sure you know your hardiness zone and buy a tree that grows well in that particular zone.\nYou probably don\u2019t need to fertilize your peach tree in the first year after planting or before the tree starts to produce fruit. After the first year, you should apply fertilizer each spring shortly before new leaf growth begins . Fertilize again in early summer.\nUse a slow-release fertilizer formulated for fruit trees and be sure to follow the directions carefully. A peach tree in need of fertilizer will not grow well and may have discolored leaves, and ultimately won\u2019t grow many peaches.\nWeeding around the tree is essential to reduce competition, especially in the first couple of years. Vigorous weed growth around young trees can inhibit their ability to grow well and weeds can actually outcompete a young tree. Pull weeds by hand, use a string trimmer (but be careful not to damage the trunk of the tree!), or use a mulch barrier to prevent weeds.\nRegular pruning is another way to improve tree health and performance . Pruning should be done in winter during the dormant period and before any buds have formed.\nFruits will develop on old wood. Prune any dead or diseased branches, as well as those that are long or tangled, branches that cross over other branches, and suckers and sprouts growing from the base of the tree.\nAnother method of pruning is to thin the fruits when they are starting to develop. A peach tree may produce more fruits than it can successfully grow. When the fruits are just starting to develop, at approximately \u00be-inch to 1-inch diameter, pluck off excess fruits.\nThin them to a single fruit every 5 to 6 inches. Why? Your tree will be able to channel more energy to fewer larger fruits rather than producing more fruits that are likely to be smaller and less healthy.\nAlways clean your tools after pruning trees. This not only keeps your tools clean and sharp but helps prevent the spread of disease between plants. Use appropriate tools for the job and keep your tools sharp. This will help make pruning easier and helps make smooth, clean cuts.\nA peach tree grown from seed can typically bear fruit in their third or fourth year after planting. A nursery-grown tree will produce fruit more quickly because it\u2019s already a year or two old. Don\u2019t worry if your tree loses some of its fruits before they ripen; this is a natural process that allows the tree to self-thin some of the fruits that it may not be able to support.\nAfter watching your peaches grow for several months, you may start to feel impatient to pick them. How will you know when your peaches are ready to harvest ?\n- There is no more green coloration\n- They are bright yellow-orange\n- They can be picked easily with just a slight twist at the stem\nBe very careful when harvesting peaches. The fruits are delicate and bruise easily. Do not grab and pull on the peaches, as this can damage both the fruits and the branches. Gently twisting where the stem meets the branch should be enough to release the fruit.\nUnfortunately, peach trees are susceptible to several pests and diseases . Carefully examine your tree on a regular basis to catch any potential problems early. Identify the situation as best you can and treat it promptly for the best results.\nA simple method to help reduce pests and diseases is to clear out fallen fruits and leaves at the end of each season, reducing areas for pests and diseases to overwinter. Giving your plant ideal growing conditions will also help keep it healthy and robust.\nThere are several pests that can damage peach trees that range from tiny worms to birds or small animals. Prevention is the best way to keep your peaches safe.\nA wire fence can keep larger pests from wandering in. A deterrent spray can keep the smaller bugs from getting too close. Predatory insects are also a good idea to incorporate into the garden.\nThese are the most apparent pests that will nibble on peaches as they ripen. Other pests are smaller and less noticeable but can cause severe damage .\nUsing a fence, chicken wire, or another barrier can keep these unwanted creatures from eating the fruit you were reserving for yourself. Be sure to harvest fruit as soon as it is ripe, before these little guys can get to it!\nThese are the larvae of a moth. They burrow into the lower trunk and larger branches. Sap will ooze from these holes and weaken the trees. Peach tree borers can be controlled with insecticides, but only if treated preventatively .\nInsecticides will work to prevent eggs from hatching, but once larvae have burrowed into the trunk, there isn\u2019t much to be done to prevent their damage.\nLarvae are tiny caterpillars that burrow into fruits. These can be somewhat controlled with insecticides. A more effective control method is a pheromone trap that attracts mating adults and prevents them from laying eggs on the fruits.\nPesky tent caterpillars build silky nests that incorporate leaves and branches of peach trees. The caterpillars eat the leaves. Physically removing the nests is the best control. They are most active in the late spring and into early summer.\nThankfully, if the population is controlled early enough, the tree can be saved.

Manage diseases by planting disease-resistant peach varieties and practicing good hygiene in the garden , such as pruning and cleaning up garden debris.\nBacterial spot is a fungal disease. It can develop on both young seedlings and on fully grown trees. It thrives in warm, humid environments .\nWhen infected, leaves become covered with small brown spots. These spots will eventually turn yellow, causing the leaf to die. This disease can be treated with fungicides.\nThis is a fungal disease caused by Taphrina deformans . It affects the flowers, leaves, and fruit. Peach leaf curl is one of the most common diseases for home gardeners growing peach trees.\nLeaves appear curled and deformed, with reddish areas developing on new leaves.

Setting your plant in the ground as early as possible gives the roots a chance to grow before the buds and new leaves emerge. Dig a hole large enough to accommodate the entire root mass. Carefully set the tree in the hole to the depth it has been growing as a nursery plant. Do not bury any extra length of trunk or underplant, leaving roots exposed. Push the soil up to the root mass at the proper depth and press the soil firmly into place to secure the tree in an upright position. If you are planting more than one peach tree, give them each adequate space . Give standard-size varieties 18 to 20 feet and dwarf varieties 5 feet. This gives each tree enough sunlight and airflow, preventing fungal diseases. Thoroughly water the tree and keep the soil moist , but not soggy, for the first few months. Keep an eye on your new tree so that if you catch any problems, you can correct them early. Finally, you will need to prune the tree back to about 3 feet tall and remove the side branches. This will ultimately help your tree grow into a sturdy compact form and produce a healthy crop of peaches. Proper care of your new peach tree is pretty straightforward. Learn about the appropriate placement, preparation, and care of your tree before you plant it , so you will be prepared to offer your tree the best environment and the best care possible. Peach trees need full sun to grow, flower, and produce fruits. A tree grown in a shaded area will not be as healthy or as vigorous. If you don\u2019t have a large enough location that\u2019s full sun, it may be best not to try planting a peach. Young trees should get approximately 1 to 1.5 inches of water per week. Rainfall may be enough if you live in an area with regular rain. If not, you will need to water or irrigate your peach tree. Ensure the water is soaking into the soil and not just running off the surface. Also, make sure to water enough to make the soil moist without being saturated or squishy. A general rule of thumb is to try to keep the soil moist without allowing it to dry completely. Peach trees are pretty sensitive to drying out and will not produce fruits if they are too dry. One of the most important things you can do to ensure a successful peach tree planting is to prepare the soil well in advance . Take the time to do this, and your newly planted tree will be off to the best start possible. Peach trees require well-drained soil in order to grow. Any waterlogged or saturated soil will cause the plant to die. The best soil for peach trees is one where the topsoil (to approximately the top 24 inches) is sandy or loamy and very well-drained. The topsoil and the subsoil should both be rich in organic matter and relatively fertile. Soil pH should be between 6.0 and 7.0. Peach trees will not do well in acidic soils. If your soil pH is below 6.0, you will need to add lime to help increase soil pH. Mix it well and continue soil testing until the proper pH is reached. After planting your peach tree, add a layer of mulch in a circle surrounding the tree but not covering the base of the tree. Avoid making a mounded pile of mulch that touches the trunk of the tree. For mulch materials, you can use straw or hay, pine needles, leaves, grass clippings, or even compost. The mulch will help protect the newly planted tree from drying out and also help prevent weed growth around the base of the tree. You can grow a peach tree in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 8 . Just check that the variety of peaches you select is hardy in your particular climate zone. There are peach varieties that are more cold-tolerant to zone 4 and more heat tolerant to zone 9, but these are less common. Peaches also need a certain number of chilling hours to successfully flower and produce fruits. Depending on the variety, peaches will most commonly require anywhere from 400 to 600 chill hours. The best thing you can do to ensure you select the best tree for your area is to make sure you know your hardiness zone and buy a tree that grows well in that particular zone. You probably don\u2019t need to fertilize your peach tree in the first year after planting or before the tree starts to produce fruit. After the first year, you should apply fertilizer each spring shortly before new leaf growth begins . Fertilize again in early summer. Use a slow-release fertilizer formulated for fruit trees and be sure to follow the directions carefully. A peach tree in need of fertilizer will not grow well and may have discolored leaves, and ultimately won\u2019t grow many peaches. Weeding around the tree is essential to reduce competition, especially in the first couple of years. Vigorous weed growth around young trees can inhibit their ability to grow well and weeds can actually outcompete a young tree. Pull weeds by hand, use a string trimmer (but be careful not to damage the trunk of the tree!), or use a mulch barrier to prevent weeds. Regular pruning is another way to improve tree health and performance . Pruning should be done in winter during the dormant period and before any buds have formed. Fruits will develop on old wood. Prune any dead or diseased branches, as well as those that are long or tangled, branches that cross over other branches, and suckers and sprouts growing from the base of the tree. Another method of pruning is to thin the fruits when they are starting to develop. A peach tree may produce more fruits than it can successfully grow. When the fruits are just starting to develop, at approximately \u00be-inch to 1-inch diameter, pluck off excess fruits. Thin them to a single fruit every 5 to 6 inches. Why? Your tree will be able to channel more energy to fewer larger fruits rather than producing more fruits that are likely to be smaller and less healthy. Always clean your tools after pruning trees. This not only keeps your tools clean and sharp but helps prevent the spread of disease between plants. Use appropriate tools for the job and keep your tools sharp. This will help make pruning easier and helps make smooth, clean cuts. A peach tree grown from seed can typically bear fruit in their third or fourth year after planting. A nursery-grown tree will produce fruit more quickly because it\u2019s already a year or two old. Don\u2019t worry if your tree loses some of its fruits before they ripen; this is a natural process that allows the tree to self-thin some of the fruits that it may not be able to support. After watching your peaches grow for several months, you may start to feel impatient to pick them. How will you know when your peaches are ready to harvest ? There is no more green coloration They are bright yellow-orange They can be picked easily with just a slight twist at the stem Be very careful when harvesting peaches. The fruits are delicate and bruise easily. Do not grab and pull on the peaches, as this can damage both the fruits and the branches. Gently twisting where the stem meets the branch should be enough to release the fruit. Unfortunately, peach trees are susceptible to several pests and diseases . Carefully examine your tree on a regular basis to catch any potential problems early. Identify the situation as best you can and treat it promptly for the best results. A simple method to help reduce pests and diseases is to clear out fallen fruits and leaves at the end of each season, reducing areas for pests and diseases to overwinter. Giving your plant ideal growing conditions will also help keep it healthy and robust. There are several pests that can damage peach trees that range from tiny worms to birds or small animals. Prevention is the best way to keep your peaches safe. A wire fence can keep larger pests from wandering in. A deterrent spray can keep the smaller bugs from getting too close. Predatory insects are also a good idea to incorporate into the garden. These are the most apparent pests that will nibble on peaches as they ripen. Other pests are smaller and less noticeable but can cause severe damage . Using a fence, chicken wire, or another barrier can keep these unwanted creatures from eating the fruit you were reserving for yourself. Be sure to harvest fruit as soon as it is ripe, before these little guys can get to it! These are the larvae of a moth. They burrow into the lower trunk and larger branches. Sap will ooze from these holes and weaken the trees. Peach tree borers can be controlled with insecticides, but only if treated preventatively . Insecticides will work to prevent eggs from hatching, but once larvae have burrowed into the trunk, there isn\u2019t much to be done to prevent their damage. Larvae are tiny caterpillars that burrow into fruits. These can be somewhat controlled with insecticides. A more effective control method is a pheromone trap that attracts mating adults and prevents them from laying eggs on the fruits. Pesky tent caterpillars build silky nests that incorporate leaves and branches of peach trees. The caterpillars eat the leaves. Physically removing the nests is the best control. They are most active in the late spring and into early summer. Thankfully, if the population is controlled early enough, the tree can be saved. Introducing predatory wasps can help reduce the number of caterpillars in the garden. Peaches are susceptible to various damaging diseases including bacterial spot, powdery mildew, and peach leaf curl. Manage diseases by planting disease-resistant peach varieties and practicing good hygiene in the garden , such as pruning and cleaning up garden debris. Bacterial spot is a fungal disease. It can develop on both young seedlings and on fully grown trees. It thrives in warm, humid environments . When infected, leaves become covered with small brown spots. These spots will eventually turn yellow, causing the leaf to die. This disease can be treated with fungicides. This is a fungal disease caused by Taphrina deformans . It affects the flowers, leaves, and fruit. Peach leaf curl is one of the most common diseases for home gardeners growing peach trees. Leaves appear curled and deformed, with reddish areas developing on new leaves. Planting disease-resistant varieties is the best way to avoid this disease. This is one of the few issues that impact peach trees more than other fruiting trees, like apple trees . This is a fairly common disease that is caused by too much moisture, or improper watering methods. It is identified as grayish-white spots or coating on leaves and fruits. It can be treated with fungicide, but it is also best to remove infected leaves and fruit from the tree. Water plants from underneath, preferably with an irrigation system or soaker hose. When you think of peach trees, the first thing you may think of is peaches. Growing fruits is probably the most common reason someone would want to plant a peach tree. But there are more reasons than that. Peach trees produce beautiful flowers in the spring, giving them value as ornamental trees. Peach trees also provide a bit of shade and are impressive trees to add to the landscape. The flowers attract pollinators, and the fruits and branches of the tree attract wildlife, providing food and shelter. Peach trees may not be the most low-maintenance fruit tree to grow, but if you like the idea of fresh, local, home-grown peaches, you can certainly grow your own. With some advance planning and careful selection of your growing site and tree variety , you will be on your way to a successful harvest. Remember to choose a variety that will grow well in your area, give it plenty of sun, water it regularly, and keep watch for pests and diseases. When it comes time to pick your peaches, you can enjoy many creative ways to eat your bountiful harvest! Are you trying to figure out which types of apple trees to grow this season?

If it\u2019s any lower, the grafted tree (called the scion) may start to put out its own roots and grow into a standard-size tree.

If it\u2019s any lower, the grafted tree (called the scion) may start to put out its own roots and grow into a standard-size tree. Do not fertilize at the time of planting. If you are planting standard-size trees, space them 15 to 20 feet apart. Space dwarf trees 10 to 12 feet apart. Most types of peach trees are self-fertile, so planting one tree is all that\u2019s needed for fruit production. If your circumstances are suitable, you might want to try a technique practiced in England. It involves planting a peach tree\u2014ideally a dwarf variety\u2014on the south side of the home (or other structure), directly under the eaves. Over time, the gardener prunes and trains the peach tree to espalier in a fan-shape against or very near to the wall of the house. Plastic sheeting is attached to the eaves and draped to cover but not touch the tree, similar to a lean-to tent. This keeps the tree dry in winter, and the tree enjoys the warmth of the sun\u2014directly and reflected off the house\u2014year round. The plastic should be opened or lifted during bloom time to welcome pollinating insects, and on hot, sunny days to ventilate the tree and prevent foliage burn. Growing About 4 to 6 weeks after the tree blooms, thin the fruit so that they are 6 to 8 inches apart on the branch. If too much fruit is left on the tree, it is likely to be smaller and subpar. Thinning the fruit ensures that the tree will focus energy on the remaining fruit. Prune and fertilize to encourage 10 to 18 inches of new growth during spring and summer.  About 6 weeks after planting, fertilize young trees with a balanced (10-10-10)\u00a0fertilizer.  Tip: Apply fertilizer in a circle around the tree, but keep it at least 18 inches away from the trunk. This encourages the roots to spread outward, rather than in on themselves. Tip: Apply fertilizer in a circle around the tree, but keep it at least 18 inches away from the trunk. This encourages the roots to spread outward, rather than in on themselves. During the second year, add 3/4 pound of nitrogen fertilizer once in the spring and once in the early summer. After the third year, add about 1 pound of nitrogen fertilizer per year to the mature trees in the spring. To help make the tree hardier, do not fertilize it within 2 months of the first fall frost date or while the fruit is maturing. Fertilizer should only be applied between spring and mid-summer. In the spring (often April) , pinch your off the tips of new branches so the tree will make side branches and be shaped nicely and your fruit will be within reach. Otherwise, the branches will keep growing long and straight without side branching.  For pinching, you can easily use your fingers to snap off tips by hand. Just pinch off the tip of a new branch just above a bud. Choose buds a distance of 1 to 2 feet from where the branch begins from a larger branch. Then your tree will grow out buds just below the pinched bud to make side branches.  Pruning in the summer can NOT be avoided. If left unpruned, peach trees weaken, may become diseased, and bear less fruit year after year. Peaches bloom and bear fruit on second-year wood; therefore, the trees need to make good growth each spring and summer for lots of fruit! The goal is to keep peach trees small, no more than six to ten feet tall. In general, you will be 1) cutting out any branches at the top from getting too high so the fruit is reachable and 2) cutting out side branches so that enough light is getting to lower branches for flower and fruit development. You want a globe or open center shape .  In the summer of the first year, cut the vigorous shoots that form on the  top of the tree  by two or three buds so the tree doesn\u2019t grow too tall. Then, remove some branches from the center. Look for three wide-angled branches, spaced equally apart, then cut back any other branches so that these three are the main branches.  In the early summer of the second year, cut back the branches in the middle of the tree to short stubs and prune any shoots developing below the three main branches. After the third year, remove any shoots in the center of the tree to keep its shape. You may need to prune a couple times a summer. The first time you prune is when the tree has put on about two feet of new branches. This can happen as early as May or it may not even happen at all (in which case you don\u2019t need to prune or it may harm the tree because some shade from leaves is important to avoid sun scald). NOTE : Summer pruning is NOT the time for any dramatic cutting. This is done in late winter when the tree is dormant. Recommended Varieties \u2018Redhaven\u2019 , which is the standard and most popular choice. These peaches are medium-size, but can be small if the tree is not properly thinned. Its skin is tough and firm and red in color. \u2018Reliance\u2019 , which is a hardy variety. It produces small and soft fruits. \u2018Harmony\u2019 ( \u2018Canadian Harmony\u2019 ), which is winter hardy and moderately resistant to bacterial leaf spot. It produces medium to large fruit and freezes well. Some zone favorites are: Zone 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Variety Hale Madison Saturn Contender Frost Topaz Florida Beauty Peaches are harvested when they are fully ripe from late June through July and August. With peaches, it\u2019s especially important to harvest at the RIGHT time. Though this timing depends on what type of peach variety, you can generally go by the color of the fruit. When peaches are fully ripe, the ground color of the fruit changes from green to completely yellow. No green should be left on the fruit. They should come off the tree with only a slight twist. The fruits found on the top and outside of the tree usually ripen first. Be careful when picking your peaches because some varieties bruise very easily. Tip: Peaches ripen faster in a closed paper bag at room temperature. You can store peaches in the refrigerator in a plastic bag. They should keep for about 5 days. You can also make use of fresh peaches by making peach jam or peach butter . Peaches can also be canned or frozen for storage. Wit and Wisdom Although peaches are native to the Chinese countryside, the peach was brought to the western world through Iran. Test buds of peaches and other sensitive fruits for freeze damage. Bring in a few twigs cut from the trees and place them in a vase of water. If the twigs bloom in a week or two, expect blossoms in the spring and a crop the following fall.

It refers to nine attributes of a Christian life inspired by the Holy Spirit living within them. These attributes are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Each of these qualities is important for living a life that is pleasing to God. When we seek the presence of God with humility and faith, we can experience true joy and peace from living according to God's will. The Fruit of the Spirit is something to strive for daily: a fruitful life in communion with God.\n\u201cBut the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.\u201d (Galatians 5:22-23)\nThe Greek word translated as \u201cfruit\u201d refers to the natural product of a living thing. Paul used \u201cfruit\u201d to help us understand the product of the Holy Spirit, who lives inside every believer. The fruit of the Spirit is produced by the Spirit, not by the Christian. The Greek word is singular, showing that \u201cfruit\u201d is a unified whole, not independent characteristics. As we grow, all the characteristics of Christ will be manifested in our lives.\nYet, like physical fruit that needs time to grow, the fruit of the Spirit will not ripen in our lives overnight. Like a successful gardener must battle against weeds to enjoy the sweet fruit they desire, we must constantly work to rid our lives of the \u201cweeds\u201d of our old sinful natures that want to choke out the work of the Spirit.\nThe Holy Spirit gives us the power to reject those old sinful desires. We can say \u201cno\u201d to sin and accept the \u201cway out\u201d God faithfully provides (1 Corinthians 10:13) by following the Holy Spirit\u2019s leading. As we give the Spirit more control of our lives, He begins to do in and through us what only He can do - to shape us and grow us to look like Jesus (2 Corinthians 3:17-18).\nSince God\u2019s goal for all His children is for us to be like Jesus (Romans 8:29), the Holy Spirit constantly works to rid our lives of the \u201cacts of the sinful nature\u201d (Gal 5:19) and display His fruit instead. Therefore, the presence of the \u201cfruit of the Spirit\u201d is evidence that our character is becoming more like Christ\u2019s.\nPaul uses nine characteristics to describe the fruit of the Spirit in the book of Galatians.

Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love .\" - 1 John 4:7-8\nTrue, biblical love is a choice, not a feeling. It deliberately expresses itself in loving ways and always seeks the welfare of others. Biblical love is dependent on the giver\u2019s character, not emotion. For instance, a mature believer demonstrating love will not exercise his or her freedom if that action might harm another Christian in some way.\nRather than risking the possibility of causing the immature Christian to question and stumble, the mature believer will not exercise his freedom out of love for his brother ( Romans 14:1-15 ). Love chooses to set aside one\u2019s own preferences, desires, and sometimes even needs to put the other person first ( Philippians 2:1-3 ).\nPhoto courtesy: Pexels/Hassan OUAJBIR\n\"May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit .\" - Romans 15:13\nSometimes we Christians tend to downplay the meaning of joy. But, the Greek word translated as \u201cjoy\u201d in Galatians 5 means \u201cgladness and delight\u201d \u2013 basically the same thing the world means when it talks about joy. It is a feeling of gladness based on our circumstances.\nSadly, the world\u2019s joy cannot last because it is based on fleeting, physical circumstances. But the joy of the Lord is established in our spiritual, eternal circumstances. As we cling tight to Jesus , abiding daily in our saving relationship with Him, we will experience the fullness of joy He promised ( John 15:4-11 ).\nPhoto courtesy: \u00a9GettyImages/fizkes\n\"You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast, because they trust in you.\" - Isaiah 26:3\nThe world doesn\u2019t offer much peace. Just look around. The world cannot give it because the world doesn\u2019t know the One who is peace. But for those who have the Spirit of peace within us, the peace of Christ is possible, no matter our circumstances ( John 14:27 ). We can reject the chaos of the world and embrace God\u2019s peace. The book of Philippians tells us how ( Philippians 4:4-9 ).\nFirst, choose to rejoice in God and who He is. Second, bring all your worries, fears, and concerns to God in prayer . Third, fill your mind with God\u2019s truth. And fourth, choose to think about the things of God.\nPhoto courtesy: \u00a9Unsplash/aaker\n\"Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love.\" - Ephesians 4:2\nWe don\u2019t see much patience in the world today, not even in the church. Maybe part of the reason is our fast-paced, want-it-now culture. But Christians have everything we need to be patient because we have the Holy Spirit living in us longing to display His character to those around us. Patient people put up with circumstances and other people, even when severely tried. Patient people display endurance, longsuffering, and perseverance.\nThe New Testament also specifically connects patience with sharing the Gospel. God is patient as He waits for the lost to come to Him ( 2 Peter 3:9 ) and He calls His people to be patient as we extend the offer of salvation in Christ to others ( 2 Timothy 4:20 ).\nPhoto courtesy: \u00a9 \u00a9Getty Images/fizkes\n\"Therefore, as God\u2019s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness...\" - Colossians 3:12\nThe characteristics of \u201ckindness\u201d and \u201cgoodness\u201d are closely related.

They are currently members of the East Division of the Canadian Football League (CFL). The Tiger-Cats play their home games at Tim Hortons Field . [3] [4]\nThe club traces its origins back to 1869 to the founding of Hamilton Football Club which adopted the nickname \u201ctigers\u201d a few years after its founding (although it had been informally been called the Tigers since its first game). In 1950, the Tigers merged with cross-town upstart Hamilton Wildcats largely to eliminate the gate competition from the underfunded Wildcats. The Tigers adopted the name \"Tiger-Cats\". [5] [6]\nSince the 1950 merger, the team has won the Grey Cup championship eight times, most recently in 1999 . The Hamilton Tiger-Cats Football Club recognizes all Grey Cups won by Hamilton-based teams as part of their history, bringing their win total to 15 (the Hamilton Tigers with five, the Hamilton Flying Wildcats and Hamilton Alerts with one each). [7] However, the CFL does not recognize these wins under one franchise, rather as the individual franchises that won them. [8] If one includes their historical lineage, Hamilton football clubs won league championships in every decade of the 20th century.\nIn their first 40 years after absorbing the Wildcats, the Tiger-Cats qualified for the playoffs in all but three of those years and won seven Grey Cup championships. They are one of six teams in the modern era to win the Grey Cup at home and were the first to accomplish this when they did it in 1972 . However, since 1990, they have missed the playoffs on eleven occasions and have won just one Grey Cup in 1999 . In addition to having the longest Grey Cup drought of all the CFL teams, they are the only team to have not won the Grey Cup in the 21st century. Their lowest point came in 2003 , when they lost a CFL record 17 games in one season, with just one win. [9] The franchise has started to return to prominence after qualifying for the post-season in eight of the 10 years of the 2010s, including appearances in the 101st , 102nd , 107th and 108th Grey Cups , where they lost each time. [8]\nBusinessman Bob Young purchased the club on October 7, 2003. He was born in Hamilton, Ontario , and graduated from Victoria College at the University of Toronto . His fortune was earned in the software industry and he is currently the owner and CEO of Lulu , a self-publishing website. [10]\nAs of 2011, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats Executive Committee consists of five people: Bob Young, Caretaker; Scott Mitchell, CEO; Doug Rye, Executive Vice President; President and COO Matt Afinec; and Vice Chairman Glenn Gibson. [11]\nOn January 2, 2022, the club reorganized its ownership under the newly announced Hamilton Sports Group, an entity that will also own Forge FC and the master licence for Tim Hortons Field . Bob Young continues to serve as chairman and the largest shareholder while also welcoming new investment from Hamilton-based steel company Stelco (represented by its chairman and CEO Alan Kestenbaum), club CEO Scott Mitchell, and Woodbine Entertainment CEO Jim Lawson . [12]\nAlthough the current Hamilton Tiger-Cats were only founded in 1950, football in Hamilton goes back much further than that. [13] The history of Hamilton Tiger-Cats Football Club can be traced back to November 3, 1869 in a room above George Lee's Fruit Store, when the Hamilton Football Club was formed. [14] The Hamilton football club played their first game on December 18, 1869 against the 13th Battalion (now Royal Hamilton Light Infantry ). In 1872, the Hamilton Football club began play at the Hamilton AAA Grounds and they became known as the Tigers in 1873. [15]\nThe Hamilton Tigers began play in the Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU) in 1883 and won their first Canadian Dominion Football Championship in 1906 when the Tigers beat McGill University 29\u20133. The Tigers continued in the ORFU until 1907, when the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (IRFU) was formed. The IRFU later became known as the Big Four and eventually, the IRFU became the East division of the modern CFL in the 1950s. The Tigers faced stiff local competition with the ORFU's Hamilton Alerts who, in 1912 , won the City of Hamilton its first Grey Cup , the trophy that was now awarded to the Canadian Dominion Football Champions, by beating the Toronto Argonauts 11\u20134.\nIn the following season (1913), the Tigers won their first of five Grey Cups when they beat the Toronto Parkdale Canoe Club by the lopsided margin of 44\u20132. The Alerts were refused entry into the ORFU in 1913 with many of its players opting to join the Tigers, while the Alerts gradually faded from existence. [16] The Alerts gave way to a team under the name Hamilton Rowing Club from 1913 to 1915, who also played in the ORFU. 1914 saw the complete amalgamation of the Hamilton Alerts and the Hamilton Tigers and the football club continued playing under the name \"Tigers\". [15] In 1915, in the final pre-war season, the Hamilton Tigers won their second Grey Cup.\nAfter over a decade-long drought, the Hamilton Tigers won the Grey Cup championship game in 1928, 1929 and 1932. The 1941 season saw the Tigers suspend play for the remainder of World War II. The Hamilton Tigers folded, largely because a number of players had gone into the armed services. It is believed by some that the failure of the Tigers is what caused the IRFU to be dissolved, and the Eastern Rugby Football Union (ERFU) to be formed. [13] Because of the absence of the Tigers, a new club called the Hamilton Wildcats were formed to play in the ORFU in 1941. The Wildcats were given permission to use players from the Hamilton Tigers, but not the traditional black and yellow colors of the Tigers. In 1943, the Hamilton Flying Wildcats, stocked with Royal Canadian Air Force personnel, won the 31st Grey Cup .\nThings returned to normal in 1945 when the IRFU and the Hamilton Tigers resumed play while the Wildcats (no longer known as the Flying Wildcats) continued on in the ORFU. In 1948 the Hamilton Wildcats joined the IRFU to replace the Tigers who joined the Ontario Rugby Football Union. The Tigers and Wildcats switch of unions only lasted two years (1948\u201349) as both clubs struggled. At this time, the Tigers and Wildcats competed for fans, talent and bragging rights so vehemently that neither team could operate on a sound financial level. [13] [17] Consequently, The Tigers and Wildcats amalgamated in 1950 to form the Hamilton Tiger-Cats that would compete in the IRFU. [15] Under the guidance of prominent and distinguished local leaders such as Ralph \"Super-Duper\" Cooper and F.M. Gibson, it was decided that the two teams should merge as one that would represent Hamilton. Cooper was named team president and Carl Voyles served as head coach and general manager. A contest was held among the fans to determine the colors for the newly formed football club; the result was a combination of the two clubs' colors: yellow, black, red, white and blue. However, the black and gold of the Tigers were largely adopted (the red tongue on the logo is only remaining nod to Wildcats red) and remain to this day. [18] In 1950, the newly christened Hamilton Tiger-Cats began playing in Civic Stadium (renamed Ivor Wynne Stadium in 1971) until 2012 after which it was demolished and replaced with a new stadium on the same site, Tim Hortons Field , in 2014.\nThe Ti-Cats had great success throughout the 1950s and 1960s, in the 1950s and 1960s the club appeared in ten Grey Cups. They finished first in the East thirteen times from 1950 to 1972. During that same time span, they appeared in eleven Grey Cup finals winning the championship six times. Players, such as Angelo Mosca , Bernie Faloney , Joe Zuger and Garney Henley became football icons in the Steel City. Beginning in 1957 under coach Jim Trimble (who left the team after the 1962 season), the Tiger-Cats played in every national final through 1967, except for those of 1960 and 1966, winning 4 Cups (1957, 1963, 1965 and 1967).\nThe Cats' 1972 Grey Cup win, 13\u201310 over the Saskatchewan Roughriders , was led by two sensational rookies, Chuck Ealey who had an outstanding college career at the University of Toledo and Ian Sunter , an 18-year-old kicker who booted the deciding field goal that gave Hamilton the cup on their home turf.\nDuring this era, the Tiger-Cats also became (and remain to this day) the only Canadian team to have ever defeated a current National Football League team; on August 8, 1961, they defeated the Buffalo Bills by a score of 38\u201321 (at the time, Buffalo was still a part of the American Football League ). [19] [20]\nIn 1978, Toronto Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard assumed ownership of the Tiger-Cats. Ballard claimed to be losing a million dollars a year. [21] The Tiger-Cats contended on and off during the rest of the 1970s and 1980s (reaching the playoffs in every year of the latter decade), reaching the Grey Cup game again in 1980 and winning the East Division by a mile in 1981 with an 11\u20134\u20131 record under head coach Frank Kush , but were stunned by the Ottawa Rough Riders , who finished a distant second at 5\u201311, in the East final. The Tabbies' defense was very stout, talented and hungry that decade, led by standouts Grover Covington , Ben Zambiasi , Howard Fields and Mitchell Price . They were complemented very well on offense with quarterbacks Tom Clements and Mike Kerrigan throwing to Rocky DiPietro and Tony Champion leading to three straight trips to the Grey Cup in 1984, 1985 and 1986, the latter resulting in winning the title over the Edmonton Eskimos by a score of 39\u201315. In 1986, Ballard publicly called the Tiger-Cats a bunch of overpaid losers. [21] After the Tiger-Cats beat the Toronto Argonauts in the 1986 Eastern Final, Ballard said \"You guys may still be overpaid, but after today, no one can call you losers.\" [21] A few days later, the Tiger-Cats won the 1986 Grey Cup by beating the Edmonton Eskimos 39\u201315; Ballard said it was worth every penny.\nHamilton businessman David Braley bought the team on February 24, 1989, and he eventually sold the team to a community-based group in 1992 due to continued poor attendance figures (Braley later bought the B.C. Lions in 1997 and the Toronto Argonauts in 2010). Hamilton returned to the Grey Cup in 1989 (making their fifth appearance in the Grey Cup game in the 1980s), but were on the losing end of a 43\u201340 thriller to Saskatchewan . The 1990s began on a sour note for the team, missing the playoffs for the first time in back-to-back years under the Tiger-Cats banner. By 1994, the team was in grave jeopardy; with the Buffalo Bills then in the midst of their run of four consecutive Super Bowl appearances and the Toronto Argonauts contending for the Grey Cup, almost all of the football attention in the Hamilton area had been sucked toward those two teams and away from the Tiger-Cats. Fewer than 6,000 season tickets were sold, prompting a threat from the CFL Commissioner Larry Smith to revoke the franchise if they did not both double the ticket sales for 1995 and raise CA$1 million in corporate sponsorship. Both thresholds were met and exceeded. [22]\nThe 1990s were marked by financial instability, and constant struggles on the field. Quarterback was a weak spot for the Ti-Cats, as the first half of the decade had names like Don McPherson , Damon Allen , Timm Rosenbach , Matt Dunigan , Lee Saltz and Todd Dillon taking their turns at the pivot. Despite the excellent play of Eastern All-Star Earl Winfield rewriting the team's record books for pass catching, Hamilton struggled to attract crowds to Ivor Wynne Stadium . It was not until 1998 with the arrival of head coach Ron Lancaster and the pitch-and-catch duo of Danny McManus and Darren Flutie plus the pass rush abilities of Joe Montford that led Hamilton back to the CFL's elite, reaching the Grey Cup finals in 1998 and winning the cup the following year . However, the Ti-Cats then suffered a slow decline. In 2000, Hamilton finished 9\u20139, losing 4 of their last 5 games, as well as the East semifinal 24\u201322 to Winnipeg.\nIn 2001, Hamilton finished 11\u20137, and lost to Winnipeg in the playoffs for a second straight season, 28\u201313. [23] In 2002, Hamilton finished 7\u201311 and missed the playoffs. [24] The team reached their lowest ebb in 2003, having not only a franchise-worst season, but the worst record in CFL history, finishing 1\u201317 (and losing the most games in the CFL's 18-game schedule), with only a 27\u201324 overtime victory in week 14 keeping the declawed Tiger-Cats from having an imperfect season. [25]\nNative Hamiltonian Bob Young has owned the Tiger-Cats since 2004, and although the team had a resurgence in home attendance, corporate sponsorship plus a brand new \"Tiger Vision\" scoreboard at Ivor Wynne stadium, it struggled with its on-field performance. Last place finishes both in 2005 (5\u201313) and 2006 (4\u201314), resulted in an overhaul of the coaching staff for 2007. The moves still did not immediately help, as the team continued to lag in last place in 2007 and 2008 despite numerous apparent upgrades. In 2009, their fortunes turned around when they finished in second place in the East, qualifying for the playoffs for the first time in several years. However, they failed to win the Grey Cup, marking the 2000s as the first decade since the 1890s that Hamilton failed to win a national championship.\nOn August 31, 2011, the Tiger-Cats announced plans to close Ivor Wynne Stadium at the end of the 2012 season and begin play in the long planned Pan American Stadium in 2014. [26] Throughout the 2013 season, they played their home games at Guelph University's stadium because the new stadium was still under construction. On November 24, 2013, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats lost to the Saskatchewan Roughriders 45\u201323 in the 101st Grey Cup at Mosaic Stadium at Taylor Field . The game had star appeal as actor Tom Hanks attended with comedian Martin Short , a Hamilton native. Early in the third quarter, Hanks was shown replacing a Ti-cats toque with a Riders hat, drawing a loud roar from the crowd. [27] After construction of the new stadium fell behind schedule in 2014, the team moved the first few games of its 2014 season to Ron Joyce Stadium .\nTim Hortons Field opened in time for the 2014 Labour Day Classic, which coincided with the Tiger-Cats going on a long run that propelled the team from 1\u20136 prior to that game to 9\u20139 (in a year when the East was particularly weak, this was enough to win the division) and two further playoff wins, propelling the team to its second straight Grey Cup appearance, which was also its second straight Grey Cup loss, as the Calgary Stampeders held off a late comeback effort from the Tiger-Cats to win 20\u201316. The team went undefeated at Tim Hortons Field in its inaugural season at the stadium.\nThe Tiger-Cats have played home games at Tim Hortons Field since 2014. The stadium is located in downtown Hamilton at the former site of Ivor Wynne Stadium which the team played at from 1950 until 2012. During construction of Tim Hortons Field in 2013, the Tiger-Cats played at Alumni Stadium in Guelph , Ontario.\nThe artwork for the original \"leaping tiger\" was designed by Jake Gaudaur , [28] a former Tiger-Cat player, President, and CFL Commissioner. The Princeton University Tigers athletic logo for many years was a mirror image of the Hamilton logo, except in orange. Both logos have since been revised or replaced. The colours of the logo are the clubs traditional colours for well over 100 years: black, yellow, and white. The red tongue is the last remaining nod to the upstart red-clad Hamilton Wildcats.\nSince 1873, the arch-rivals of the Tiger-Cats have been the Toronto Argonauts . The first meeting took place on October 18, 1873 at the University of Toronto where the Argonauts defeated the Hamilton Football Club by a Goal and a Try to Nil. [16] The biggest event of the rivalry is the annual Labour Day Classic , first held in 1948, with Hamilton holding a 31-15 lead. Hamilton has hosted the match almost continuously since 1996 , with a rematch held the following week in Toronto. There have been 17 playoff match-ups between the two teams, with Toronto holding a 10-7 edge. Hamilton and Toronto are merely 51 km apart along the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) highway and, for relatively brief periods of time, were the only CFL teams in Ontario as there was no Ottawa team from 1997-2002, and again from 2006-2013.\nOther Tiger-Cats rivals include the Montreal Alouettes , the Ottawa Redblacks, and recently the Winnipeg Blue Bombers after a pair of Grey Cup matchups.\nCorus Radio Hamilton was the official radio broadcast rights holder for the Tiger-Cats and had been the official voice for CFL football in the Greater Hamilton Area for over 40 years. AM900 CHML , together with sister station CJXY-FM, offered coverage of all Tiger-Cats games, including pre-season games. [29] [30] Hamilton Tiger-Cats games broadcast on CHML were anchored by the announcers team of Rick Zamperin, John Salavantis , and Matt Holmes. Zamperin, CHML's sports director, became the play-by-play announcer in 2007 after six seasons as sideline reporter. Color commentator John Salavantis was a former football coach with the Tiger-Cats, Ottawa Rough Riders, Montreal Machine , and the Ottawa University Braves . CHML's Matt Holmes was the pre-game show host and sideline reporter. The post-game show, \"The Fifth Quarter\", was hosted by Ted Michaels. (CHML continues to carry The Fifth Quarter as an unofficial postgame show, now hosted by Rick Zamperin.)\nIn May 2015, the Tiger-Cats left CHML for CKOC , where the team operates a joint venture with TSN Radio . [31] Through the 2015 season, former McMaster Marauders quarterback Marshall Ferguson offered sideline analysis of all Tiger-Cats games, along with a post-game show on TSN 1150 Hamilton. Ferguson was promoted to lead play-by-play announcer in 2016. Select Tiger-Cats games are simulcast on CKTB in St. Catharines (also owned by Bell Media) to extend the Tiger-Cats radio network listenership towards the Niagara region (CHML's coverage pattern already covered Niagara, whereas CKOC's is pointed more toward Toronto and does not cover Niagara as well). Bell Media announced it was dropping TSN Radio from CKOC on February 9, 2021, and the Tiger-Cats responded that it was ending the partnership with Bell shortly thereafter and had begun working on alternate ways to distribute the broadcasts. [32] It announced the launch of the \"Ticats Audio Network\" on August 3, 2021, with game broadcasts returning to CHML and other audio content moving to a podcast format.

They are currently members of the East Division of the Canadian Football League (CFL). The Tiger-Cats play their home games at Tim Hortons Field . [3] [4] The club traces its origins back to 1869 to the founding of Hamilton Football Club which adopted the nickname \u201ctigers\u201d a few years after its founding (although it had been informally been called the Tigers since its first game). In 1950, the Tigers merged with cross-town upstart Hamilton Wildcats largely to eliminate the gate competition from the underfunded Wildcats. The Tigers adopted the name \"Tiger-Cats\". [5] [6] Since the 1950 merger, the team has won the Grey Cup championship eight times, most recently in 1999 . The Hamilton Tiger-Cats Football Club recognizes all Grey Cups won by Hamilton-based teams as part of their history, bringing their win total to 15 (the Hamilton Tigers with five, the Hamilton Flying Wildcats and Hamilton Alerts with one each). [7] However, the CFL does not recognize these wins under one franchise, rather as the individual franchises that won them. [8] If one includes their historical lineage, Hamilton football clubs won league championships in every decade of the 20th century. In their first 40 years after absorbing the Wildcats, the Tiger-Cats qualified for the playoffs in all but three of those years and won seven Grey Cup championships. They are one of six teams in the modern era to win the Grey Cup at home and were the first to accomplish this when they did it in 1972 . However, since 1990, they have missed the playoffs on eleven occasions and have won just one Grey Cup in 1999 . In addition to having the longest Grey Cup drought of all the CFL teams, they are the only team to have not won the Grey Cup in the 21st century. Their lowest point came in 2003 , when they lost a CFL record 17 games in one season, with just one win. [9] The franchise has started to return to prominence after qualifying for the post-season in eight of the 10 years of the 2010s, including appearances in the 101st , 102nd , 107th and 108th Grey Cups , where they lost each time. [8] Businessman Bob Young purchased the club on October 7, 2003. He was born in Hamilton, Ontario , and graduated from Victoria College at the University of Toronto . His fortune was earned in the software industry and he is currently the owner and CEO of Lulu , a self-publishing website. [10] As of 2011, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats Executive Committee consists of five people: Bob Young, Caretaker; Scott Mitchell, CEO; Doug Rye, Executive Vice President; President and COO Matt Afinec; and Vice Chairman Glenn Gibson. [11] On January 2, 2022, the club reorganized its ownership under the newly announced Hamilton Sports Group, an entity that will also own Forge FC and the master licence for Tim Hortons Field . Bob Young continues to serve as chairman and the largest shareholder while also welcoming new investment from Hamilton-based steel company Stelco (represented by its chairman and CEO Alan Kestenbaum), club CEO Scott Mitchell, and Woodbine Entertainment CEO Jim Lawson . [12] Although the current Hamilton Tiger-Cats were only founded in 1950, football in Hamilton goes back much further than that. [13] The history of Hamilton Tiger-Cats Football Club can be traced back to November 3, 1869 in a room above George Lee's Fruit Store, when the Hamilton Football Club was formed. [14] The Hamilton football club played their first game on December 18, 1869 against the 13th Battalion (now Royal Hamilton Light Infantry ). In 1872, the Hamilton Football club began play at the Hamilton AAA Grounds and they became known as the Tigers in 1873. [15] The Hamilton Tigers began play in the Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU) in 1883 and won their first Canadian Dominion Football Championship in 1906 when the Tigers beat McGill University 29\u20133. The Tigers continued in the ORFU until 1907, when the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (IRFU) was formed. The IRFU later became known as the Big Four and eventually, the IRFU became the East division of the modern CFL in the 1950s. The Tigers faced stiff local competition with the ORFU's Hamilton Alerts who, in 1912 , won the City of Hamilton its first Grey Cup , the trophy that was now awarded to the Canadian Dominion Football Champions, by beating the Toronto Argonauts 11\u20134. In the following season (1913), the Tigers won their first of five Grey Cups when they beat the Toronto Parkdale Canoe Club by the lopsided margin of 44\u20132. The Alerts were refused entry into the ORFU in 1913 with many of its players opting to join the Tigers, while the Alerts gradually faded from existence. [16] The Alerts gave way to a team under the name Hamilton Rowing Club from 1913 to 1915, who also played in the ORFU. 1914 saw the complete amalgamation of the Hamilton Alerts and the Hamilton Tigers and the football club continued playing under the name \"Tigers\". [15] In 1915, in the final pre-war season, the Hamilton Tigers won their second Grey Cup. After over a decade-long drought, the Hamilton Tigers won the Grey Cup championship game in 1928, 1929 and 1932. The 1941 season saw the Tigers suspend play for the remainder of World War II. The Hamilton Tigers folded, largely because a number of players had gone into the armed services. It is believed by some that the failure of the Tigers is what caused the IRFU to be dissolved, and the Eastern Rugby Football Union (ERFU) to be formed. [13] Because of the absence of the Tigers, a new club called the Hamilton Wildcats were formed to play in the ORFU in 1941. The Wildcats were given permission to use players from the Hamilton Tigers, but not the traditional black and yellow colors of the Tigers. In 1943, the Hamilton Flying Wildcats, stocked with Royal Canadian Air Force personnel, won the 31st Grey Cup .

The Tigers and Wildcats switch of unions only lasted two years (1948\u201349) as both clubs struggled. At this time, the Tigers and Wildcats competed for fans, talent and bragging rights so vehemently that neither team could operate on a sound financial level. [13] [17] Consequently, The Tigers and Wildcats amalgamated in 1950 to form the Hamilton Tiger-Cats that would compete in the IRFU. [15] Under the guidance of prominent and distinguished local leaders such as Ralph \"Super-Duper\" Cooper and F.M.

The Cats' 1972 Grey Cup win, 13\u201310 over the Saskatchewan Roughriders , was led by two sensational rookies, Chuck Ealey who had an outstanding college career at the University of Toledo and Ian Sunter , an 18-year-old kicker who booted the deciding field goal that gave Hamilton the cup on their home turf. During this era, the Tiger-Cats also became (and remain to this day) the only Canadian team to have ever defeated a current National Football League team; on August 8, 1961, they defeated the Buffalo Bills by a score of 38\u201321 (at the time, Buffalo was still a part of the American Football League ). [19] [20] In 1978, Toronto Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard assumed ownership of the Tiger-Cats. Ballard claimed to be losing a million dollars a year.

The Tabbies' defense was very stout, talented and hungry that decade, led by standouts Grover Covington , Ben Zambiasi , Howard Fields and Mitchell Price . They were complemented very well on offense with quarterbacks Tom Clements and Mike Kerrigan throwing to Rocky DiPietro and Tony Champion leading to three straight trips to the Grey Cup in 1984, 1985 and 1986, the latter resulting in winning the title over the Edmonton Eskimos by a score of 39\u201315. In 1986, Ballard publicly called the Tiger-Cats a bunch of overpaid losers. [21] After the Tiger-Cats beat the Toronto Argonauts in the 1986 Eastern Final, Ballard said \"You guys may still be overpaid, but after today, no one can call you losers.\" [21] A few days later, the Tiger-Cats won the 1986 Grey Cup by beating the Edmonton Eskimos 39\u201315; Ballard said it was worth every penny. Hamilton businessman David Braley bought the team on February 24, 1989, and he eventually sold the team to a community-based group in 1992 due to continued poor attendance figures (Braley later bought the B.C. Lions in 1997 and the Toronto Argonauts in 2010). Hamilton returned to the Grey Cup in 1989 (making their fifth appearance in the Grey Cup game in the 1980s), but were on the losing end of a 43\u201340 thriller to Saskatchewan . The 1990s began on a sour note for the team, missing the playoffs for the first time in back-to-back years under the Tiger-Cats banner. By 1994, the team was in grave jeopardy; with the Buffalo Bills then in the midst of their run of four consecutive Super Bowl appearances and the Toronto Argonauts contending for the Grey Cup, almost all of the football attention in the Hamilton area had been sucked toward those two teams and away from the Tiger-Cats. Fewer than 6,000 season tickets were sold, prompting a threat from the CFL Commissioner Larry Smith to revoke the franchise if they did not both double the ticket sales for 1995 and raise CA$1 million in corporate sponsorship. Both thresholds were met and exceeded. [22] The 1990s were marked by financial instability, and constant struggles on the field. Quarterback was a weak spot for the Ti-Cats, as the first half of the decade had names like Don McPherson , Damon Allen , Timm Rosenbach , Matt Dunigan , Lee Saltz and Todd Dillon taking their turns at the pivot. Despite the excellent play of Eastern All-Star Earl Winfield rewriting the team's record books for pass catching, Hamilton struggled to attract crowds to Ivor Wynne Stadium . It was not until 1998 with the arrival of head coach Ron Lancaster and the pitch-and-catch duo of Danny McManus and Darren Flutie plus the pass rush abilities of Joe Montford that led Hamilton back to the CFL's elite, reaching the Grey Cup finals in 1998 and winning the cup the following year . However, the Ti-Cats then suffered a slow decline. In 2000, Hamilton finished 9\u20139, losing 4 of their last 5 games, as well as the East semifinal 24\u201322 to Winnipeg. In 2001, Hamilton finished 11\u20137, and lost to Winnipeg in the playoffs for a second straight season, 28\u201313. [23] In 2002, Hamilton finished 7\u201311 and missed the playoffs. [24] The team reached their lowest ebb in 2003, having not only a franchise-worst season, but the worst record in CFL history, finishing 1\u201317 (and losing the most games in the CFL's 18-game schedule), with only a 27\u201324 overtime victory in week 14 keeping the declawed Tiger-Cats from having an imperfect season. [25] Native Hamiltonian Bob Young has owned the Tiger-Cats since 2004, and although the team had a resurgence in home attendance, corporate sponsorship plus a brand new \"Tiger Vision\" scoreboard at Ivor Wynne stadium, it struggled with its on-field performance. Last place finishes both in 2005 (5\u201313) and 2006 (4\u201314), resulted in an overhaul of the coaching staff for 2007. The moves still did not immediately help, as the team continued to lag in last place in 2007 and 2008 despite numerous apparent upgrades. In 2009, their fortunes turned around when they finished in second place in the East, qualifying for the playoffs for the first time in several years. However, they failed to win the Grey Cup, marking the 2000s as the first decade since the 1890s that Hamilton failed to win a national championship. On August 31, 2011, the Tiger-Cats announced plans to close Ivor Wynne Stadium at the end of the 2012 season and begin play in the long planned Pan American Stadium in 2014. [26] Throughout the 2013 season, they played their home games at Guelph University's stadium because the new stadium was still under construction. On November 24, 2013, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats lost to the Saskatchewan Roughriders 45\u201323 in the 101st Grey Cup at Mosaic Stadium at Taylor Field . The game had star appeal as actor Tom Hanks attended with comedian Martin Short , a Hamilton native. Early in the third quarter, Hanks was shown replacing a Ti-cats toque with a Riders hat, drawing a loud roar from the crowd. [27] After construction of the new stadium fell behind schedule in 2014, the team moved the first few games of its 2014 season to Ron Joyce Stadium . Tim Hortons Field opened in time for the 2014 Labour Day Classic, which coincided with the Tiger-Cats going on a long run that propelled the team from 1\u20136 prior to that game to 9\u20139 (in a year when the East was particularly weak, this was enough to win the division) and two further playoff wins, propelling the team to its second straight Grey Cup appearance, which was also its second straight Grey Cup loss, as the Calgary Stampeders held off a late comeback effort from the Tiger-Cats to win 20\u201316. The team went undefeated at Tim Hortons Field in its inaugural season at the stadium. The Tiger-Cats have played home games at Tim Hortons Field since 2014. The stadium is located in downtown Hamilton at the former site of Ivor Wynne Stadium which the team played at from 1950 until 2012. During construction of Tim Hortons Field in 2013, the Tiger-Cats played at Alumni Stadium in Guelph , Ontario. The artwork for the original \"leaping tiger\" was designed by Jake Gaudaur , [28] a former Tiger-Cat player, President, and CFL Commissioner. The Princeton University Tigers athletic logo for many years was a mirror image of the Hamilton logo, except in orange. Both logos have since been revised or replaced. The colours of the logo are the clubs traditional colours for well over 100 years: black, yellow, and white. The red tongue is the last remaining nod to the upstart red-clad Hamilton Wildcats. Since 1873, the arch-rivals of the Tiger-Cats have been the Toronto Argonauts . The first meeting took place on October 18, 1873 at the University of Toronto where the Argonauts defeated the Hamilton Football Club by a Goal and a Try to Nil. [16] The biggest event of the rivalry is the annual Labour Day Classic , first held in 1948, with Hamilton holding a 31-15 lead. Hamilton has hosted the match almost continuously since 1996 , with a rematch held the following week in Toronto. There have been 17 playoff match-ups between the two teams, with Toronto holding a 10-7 edge. Hamilton and Toronto are merely 51 km apart along the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) highway and, for relatively brief periods of time, were the only CFL teams in Ontario as there was no Ottawa team from 1997-2002, and again from 2006-2013. Other Tiger-Cats rivals include the Montreal Alouettes , the Ottawa Redblacks, and recently the Winnipeg Blue Bombers after a pair of Grey Cup matchups. Corus Radio Hamilton was the official radio broadcast rights holder for the Tiger-Cats and had been the official voice for CFL football in the Greater Hamilton Area for over 40 years. AM900 CHML , together with sister station CJXY-FM, offered coverage of all Tiger-Cats games, including pre-season games. [29] [30] Hamilton Tiger-Cats games broadcast on CHML were anchored by the announcers team of Rick Zamperin, John Salavantis , and Matt Holmes. Zamperin, CHML's sports director, became the play-by-play announcer in 2007 after six seasons as sideline reporter. Color commentator John Salavantis was a former football coach with the Tiger-Cats, Ottawa Rough Riders, Montreal Machine , and the Ottawa University Braves . CHML's Matt Holmes was the pre-game show host and sideline reporter. The post-game show, \"The Fifth Quarter\", was hosted by Ted Michaels. (CHML continues to carry The Fifth Quarter as an unofficial postgame show, now hosted by Rick Zamperin.) In May 2015, the Tiger-Cats left CHML for CKOC , where the team operates a joint venture with TSN Radio . [31] Through the 2015 season, former McMaster Marauders quarterback Marshall Ferguson offered sideline analysis of all Tiger-Cats games, along with a post-game show on TSN 1150 Hamilton. Ferguson was promoted to lead play-by-play announcer in 2016. Select Tiger-Cats games are simulcast on CKTB in St. Catharines (also owned by Bell Media) to extend the Tiger-Cats radio network listenership towards the Niagara region (CHML's coverage pattern already covered Niagara, whereas CKOC's is pointed more toward Toronto and does not cover Niagara as well). Bell Media announced it was dropping TSN Radio from CKOC on February 9, 2021, and the Tiger-Cats responded that it was ending the partnership with Bell shortly thereafter and had begun working on alternate ways to distribute the broadcasts. [32] It announced the launch of the \"Ticats Audio Network\" on August 3, 2021, with game broadcasts returning to CHML and other audio content moving to a podcast format.

The Tiger-Cats have won eight Grey Cup titles in the six decades since their formation in 1950. Because each Hamilton franchise is connected to the current Tiger-Cats team, the team recognizes all 15 Grey Cup victories by Hamilton-based teams as part of its history. Hamilton has won the Grey Cup a total of 8 times. The most recent victory was in 1999. It will be the first Grey Cup game played in Hamilton in 25 years.

The Hamilton Tiger-Cat Alumni Association manages the Alumni Association. There are some parallels between Hamilton\u2019s last hosting of the event and the city\u2019s next hosting in 2021. This year\u2019s festivities will be subdued as a result of the pandemic. The Canadian Football League, on the other hand, is a tough and uncompromising sport that will not be easily defeated. There is no doubt that the rivalry between Hamilton and Winnipeg is one of the best in Canadian football. Each team has played each other 19 times in Grey Cup history, with Winnipeg winning four times.

Division in the Canadian Football League. The team was formed in 1950 by the merger of the Hamilton Tigers and Hamilton Wildcats. Of the two teams, the Tigers were the older and more established franchise dating back to the late 1800s, while the Wildcats were a much newer club. For most of the period between 1900 and 1950, there were two football teams in Hamilton: the Tigers and one of a string of often short-lived teams that culminated with the Wildcats in 1950.\nSince the 1950 merger, the Tiger-Cats have won eight Grey Cup championships, most recently in 1999. The team also recognizes all 15 Grey Cups won by Hamilton-based teams as part of its history since each franchise is connected to the current Tiger-Cats club. The Tigers won five Grey Cups, while the Hamilton Flying Wildcats and Hamilton Alerts each won once. However, the CFL does not recognize these wins under one franchise, rather as the individual franchises that won them. If one includes their historical lineage, Hamilton football clubs won league championships in every decade of the 20th century, a feat matched by only one other North American franchise in professional sports, the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings Baseball Club of the International League. After winning at least once in every decade of the 20 th century, neither team won a championship in the first decade of the 21st century.\nWhile the Tiger-Cats were only founded in 1950, football in Hamilton goes back much further than that. In fact, Hamilton has one of the oldest traditions of football of any city in the country. Legend has it that the Hamilton Football Club was formed November 3, 1869 in a room above George Lee\u2019s Fruit Store where the team adopted the colours black and yellow. The Tigers played their first game December 18, 1869 against the 13th Battalion (now Royal Hamilton Light Infantry). In 1872, the Hamilton Football Club began play at the Hamilton AAA Grounds and they became known as the Tigers in 1873.\nBy 1883, the Hamilton Tigers began play in the Ontario Rugby Football Union playoffs. There was no regular season then, just playoff rounds to determine the league champion. In 1883, the Tigers lost to the Ottawa F.C. 14-9 in the semi-final. The first championship team in Hamilton football history came in 1890 when the Tigers beat Queen\u2019s University 8-6 in the ORFU final. The ORFU began playing a regular season in 1898 and the Tigers finished second with a 4-2 record. The Tigers won two Canadian Dominion Football Championships in 1906 \u2013 with a 29-3 win over McGill University \u2013 and 1908 \u2013 with a 21-17 win over the University of Toronto. The team continued in the ORFU until 1907 when the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union was formed. The IRFU consisted of the Tigers, Toronto Argonauts, Ottawa Rough Riders and the Montreal Winged Wheelers. The IRFU later became known as the Big Four and eventually the IRFU became the East Division of the modern CFL in the 1950s.\nThe IRFU Tigers faced stiff local competition from the ORFU\u2019s Hamilton Alerts, who in 1912, won the 4 th Grey Cup by beating the Toronto Argonauts 11-4 to become the first team from Hamilton and the first ORFU team to win the championship. The following season in 1913, the Tigers won their first of five Grey Cups, defeating the Toronto Parkdale Canoe Club by a lopsided 44-2 score. The Alerts were refused re-entry into the ORFU in 1913 with many of its players opting to join the Tigers in the IRFU. The Alerts gave way to the Hamilton Rowing Club who played in the ORFU from 1913 to 1915, and by 1914, the Alerts and Tigers were completely amalgamated and continued playing under the name \u201cTigers\u201d in the IRFU.\nFrom 1916 to 1918 due to World War I, the IRFU and ORFU suspended play. In the final pre-war season in 1915, the Tigers won the Grey Cup again. At that time, the winning teams were responsible for engraving the Grey Cup which Earl Grey had donated in 1909. Before heading off to war, the Hamilton Tigers had the trophy engraved not just for their 1915 win, but for their 1908 Dominion Championship. In essence, they awarded themselves the Grey Cup one year before it even existed. The escapade escaped notice for many years as the Grey Cup was not the highly prized trophy it is today.\nHamilton did have a football team in 1916 as the Hamilton 205th Battalion played in a military league. The Tigers and the Hamilton Rowing Club returned in 1919 when the IRFU and ORFU resumed play. Things were rather unsettled for the second Hamilton team in the ORFU. After not playing for two years, the Hamilton Rowing Club returned from 1922 to 1925. In 1926, the team was called the Hamilton Tigers II. The club got a slightly more dignified name in the Hamilton Tiger Cubs in 1927. The Tiger Cubs lasted from 1927 to 1936. Over that stretch, the Tigers from the IRFU won three more Grey Cups in 1928, 1929 and 1932, and were finalists in 1935. The cat-themed names continued with the Hamilton Panthers who played one season in the ORFU in 1937. There was no Hamilton ORFU team in 1938 and 1939 before the Alerts were revived for one season in 1940.\nIn 1941, amidst World War II, the Hamilton Tigers folded largely because a number of players had gone into the armed services. In a ripple effect, the failure of the Tigers caused the IRFU to be dissolved, and the Eastern Rugby Football Union was formed. The ERFU consisted of the Toronto Argonauts, Ottawa Rough Riders, Montreal Bulldogs and Toronto Balmy Beach, the latter moving over from the ORFU. In Hamilton, the Hamilton Wildcats were formed to play in the ORFU and were given permission to use players from the Hamilton Tigers, but not the traditional black and yellow colours of the Tigers. The red and white Wildcats played in a three-team ORFU with the Toronto Indians and the Kitchener Panthers, and the team played out of Civic Stadium (later renamed Ivor Wynne Stadium in 1971).\nThe ERFU lasted only one season leaving only the ORFU for the duration of the war (1942-44). The ORFU consisted of some of its traditional teams such as the Toronto Balmy Beach, and some military teams like the Toronto RCAF Hurricanes. The Wildcats would go on to win the Grey Cup in 1943. Officially, the team name for the 1943 champions was the Hamilton Flying Wildcats, as they were stocked by RCAF personnel. The Flying Wildcats were led by coach Brian Timmis and one of the greatest players in Canadian football history, Joe (King) Krol. In 1944, the navy got bragging rights over the air force as the Montreal-based St. Hyacinthe-Donnaconna Navy team beat the Flying Wildcats in the Grey Cup game played in Hamilton at Civic Stadium.\nThings started to return to normal in 1945 when the IRFU and the Hamilton Tigers resumed play while the Wildcats (without the Flying) continued on in the ORFU. In a strange twist, the Tigers and the Wildcats switched leagues in 1948 with the Tigers moving to the ORFU and the Wildcats to the IRFU. The switch was largely prompted by a dispute between the Tigers and the IRFU over the salary of Frank Filchock. In 1947, the Tigers signed Filchock, a star quarterback who had been suspended by the National Football League over some (unproven) gambling issues. Filchock\u2019s high (for the times) $7,000 salary caused problems for the Tigers who wanted the other IRFU teams to help pay for it. The Tigers felt that the other IRFU teams were benefiting from the increased attendance that Filchock inspired, but the Tigers were prevented from benefiting because of their small stadium size. The other IRFU teams didn\u2019t agree and refused to help pay Filchock\u2019s salary, which prompted the Tigers to leave the IRFU and move to the ORFU, which did agree to such a salary sharing proposal to help try to reverse its fortunes. Naturally, the Wildcats moved from the ORFU to the IRFU to replace them.\nThat switch lasted two years (1948-49) and things didn\u2019t go well. The Tigers lost Filchock to the Montreal Alouettes of the IRFU and the Wildcats weren\u2019t doing well in the IRFU. The Tigers wanted to return to the IRFU, but the Wildcats didn\u2019t want to leave. The IRFU solution was to merge the two clubs and create the Tiger-Cats, with the team calling Civic Stadium home. With the Alouettes having been formed in 1946 and the Toronto Argonauts and Ottawa Rough Riders already in place, the modern CFL was complete.\nThe ORFU and the IRFU co-existed until 1960 when the ORFU disbanded. The ORFU, however, had been excluded from the Grey Cup playoffs after 1954, and really had become a development league for the IRFU since the end of World War II. For most of the years between the formation of the IRFU in 1907 and the amalgamation that formed the Tiger-Cats in 1950, Hamilton tended to have two football clubs, one in the IRFU and one in the ORFU. The IRFU team was, except for the \u201chiccup\u201d in the late 1940s, the Hamilton Tigers, while a succession of Hamilton teams played in the ORFU after the Tigers left in 1906.\nIf there is one word that characterized the early Tiger-Cat teams, it was \u201ctough.\u201d Hamilton was the \u201cSteel Town\u201d and that was the way the city liked its football team to be. The early 1950s were good to Hamilton as the team finished first or second in every year from 1950 to 1953 under head coach Carl Voyles, winning their first Grey Cup in 1953. The team also broke down barriers as Bernie Custis became the first black starting quarterback in professional football history in 1951. Custis immediately earned all-star status in the IRFU and is considered one of the great pioneers in pro sports history. Big and tough head coach Jim Trimble arrived on the scene in 1957, uniting with rugged defensive linemen Vince Scott and Pete Neumann, and leading the Tiger-Cats to their second Grey Cup win. For five of six years between 1957 and 1962, it was Hamilton and Winnipeg in the Grey Cup Final. Unfortunately for Hamilton, Winnipeg won the last four of those meetings, after losing the initial one in 1957. During those years, the Tiger-Cats were led on offence by Bernie Faloney and Tommy Grant.\nAfter the 1960 season, Hamilton attempted to trade Faloney to Montreal for Sam Etcheverry, but the deal fell through when Etcheverry, and later the courts, declared his contract broken and he was off to the NFL. During this era, the Tiger-Cats also became (and remain to this day) the only Canadian team to have ever defeated a current National Football League team. On August 8, 1961, the Ticats defeated the Buffalo Bills by a score of 38-21 (at the time, Buffalo was still a part of the American Football League).\nRalph Sazio took over as head coach from 1963 to 1967, leading Hamilton to the Grey Cup game in four of his five seasons before taking over as general manager. With Faloney still at the helm and a stout offensive line anchored by Ellison Kelly, the Tiger-Cats broke their four-game losing streak in the Grey Cup with a 21-10 win over BC in 1963. While Faloney led the offence, the defence was led by a pair of prototypical Tiger-Cat tough guys in John Barrow and Angelo Mosca. It was a hit, that some say was late, by Angelo Mosca on BC star running back Willie Fleming that put him out of the 1963 game, which is often credited as being the turning point in that game. There was some revenge, however, for the Lions in 1964 when they defeated the Tiger-Cats to win their first Grey Cup. The Tiger-Cats won two more Grey Cups in the 1960s, with wins in 1965 and 1967. The winning combination was a tough defence and a touch of offence brought by outstanding players like Garney Henley, Joe Zuger, Willie Bethea and Tommy Joe Coffey.\nThe early-to-mid 1970s saw the debut of Tony Gabriel, the final years of Ticats greats Bill Danychuk and Bob Krouse, full-scale renovations to Civic Stadium which was renamed Ivor Wynn Stadium in 1971, and another Grey Cup win in 1972 in front of a hometown crowd in Hamilton. The 13-10 win over the Saskatchewan Roughriders at Ivor Wynne Stadium was led by two sensational rookies, Chuck Ealey, who had an outstanding college career at the University of Toledo, and Ian Sunter, a 19-year-old kicker who booted the deciding field goal that gave Hamilton the championship.\nIn 1978, Toronto Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard assumed ownership of the Tiger Cats. Ballard claimed to be losing a million dollars a year. The Tiger-Cats contended on and off during the rest of the 1970s and 1980s, reaching the Grey Cup final in 1980 and winning the East Division in 1981 with an 11-4-1 record under head coach Frank Kush. However, they were upset by the Ottawa Rough Riders, who finished a distant second at 5-11, in the Eastern Final.\nAl Bruno took over as head coach from 1983 to 1990, and the team returned to four more Grey Cups. Bruno\u2019s defence during his tenure, led by standouts Grover Covington, Ben Zambiasi, Less Browne, Howard Fields and Mitchell Price, was very stout, talented and hungry. They were complemented well on offence by quarterback Mike Kerrigan throwing to Rocky DiPietro and Tony Champion, which led to three-straight trips to the Grey Cup in 1984, 1985 and 1986, the latter resulting in winning the title over the Edmonton Eskimos. In 1986, Ballard publicly called the Tiger-Cats a bunch of overpaid losers. After the Tiger-Cats beat the Toronto Argonauts in the 1986 Eastern Final, Ballard said, \u201cYou guys may still be overpaid, but after today, no one can call you losers.\u201d A few days later, the Tiger-Cats won the 1986 Grey Cup by beating the Edmonton Eskimos 39-15. Ballard said it was worth every penny.\nHamilton businessman David Braley bought the team in 1989 and he would eventually sell the team to a community-based group in 1992 due to continued poor attendance (Braley would later buy the BC Lions in 1997). Hamilton returned to the Grey Cup in 1989 (making their fifth appearance in the Grey Cup game in the 1980s), but were on the losing end of a 43-40 thriller to Saskatchewan.\nThe 1990s were marked by financial instability and constant struggles on the field. Quarterback consistency was a weak spot for the Ticats, as the first half of the decade had names like Don McPherson, Damon Allen, Timm Rosenbach, Matt Dunigan, Lee Saltz and Todd Dillon taking their turns at the pivot for brief tenures. Despite the excellent play of all-star Earl Winfield rewriting the team\u2019s record books for pass catching and prolific placekicker Paul Osbaldiston in the prime of his lengthy career, Hamilton struggled to attract crowds to Ivor Wynne Stadium. It was not until 1998, with the arrival of head coach Ron Lancaster and the pitch-and-catch duo of Danny McManus and Darren Flutie, plus the pass-rush abilities of Joe Montford, that Hamilton returned to the CFL\u2019s elite, reaching the Grey Cup game in 1998 and winning the title in 1999.\nIn 2003, Hamilton entrepreneur Bob Young was introduced by the CFL as the new owner and caretaker of the Tiger-Cats, purchasing the team out of bankruptcy. Under Young\u2019s leadership, the Tiger-Cats regained the trust of their loyal supporters and restored financial stability off the field.\nPlaying out of an aging Ivor Wynne Stadium, Young was instrumental in brokering a deal for a new permanent home for the team. The success of that project resulted in the construction of Tim Hortons Field, which was built on the very same land formerly occupied by Ivor Wynne Stadium. To facilitate the demolition of the old stadium and construction of the new one, the Tiger-Cats played their home games during the 2013 season out of the University of Guelph\u2019s Alumni Stadium and started 2014 playing home games at McMaster University\u2019s Ron Joyce Stadium before moving into their new home at Tim Hortons Field on Labour Day 2014. The 23,218-seat multipurpose stadium has over 1,000 club seats, 30 private suites and social viewing areas that facilitate out-of-seat viewing experiences in both the north and south end zones.\nOn the field, the club gradually returned to respectability. In December 2012, the team hired Kent Austin as Vice President of Football Operations, General Manager and Head Coach. Under Austin from 2013 to 2017, the Tiger-Cats enjoyed their best years in the Young era to date, culminating with back-to-back Grey Cup appearances in 2013 and 2014. With Austin at the helm, the club also earned two East Division titles and three Eastern Final appearances, and finished top-two in the East in four consecutive seasons (2013-16), marking only the second time (1998-2001) the Tiger-Cats had done so since the 1960s. Notable players brought in by Austin included quarterbacks Henry Burris, Zach Collaros and Jeremiah Masoli, receivers Brandon Banks and Luke Tasker, and defensive stalwarts Simoni Lawrence and Ted Laurent.\nAfter a brief stint with legendary coach June Jones at the helm in 2017 and 2018, current head coach Orlondo Steinauer will usher in a new era in 2019. Steinauer and his staff, that includes coordinators Mark Washington (defence), Tommy Condell (offence) and Jeff Reinebold (special teams), will look to help the Tiger-Cats claim its first Grey Cup championship since 1999.", "source_raw_text": "The Hamilton Tiger-Cats Football Club is a professional Canadian football team based in Hamilton, Ontario, and currently a member of the East Division in the Canadian Football League. The team was formed in 1950 by the merger of the Hamilton Tigers and Hamilton Wildcats. Of the two teams, the Tigers were the older and more established franchise dating back to the late 1800s, while the Wildcats were a much newer club. For most of the period between 1900 and 1950, there were two football teams in Hamilton: the Tigers and one of a string of often short-lived teams that culminated with the Wildcats in 1950. Since the 1950 merger, the Tiger-Cats have won eight Grey Cup championships, most recently in 1999. The team also recognizes all 15 Grey Cups won by Hamilton-based teams as part of its history since each franchise is connected to the current Tiger-Cats club. The Tigers won five Grey Cups, while the Hamilton Flying Wildcats and Hamilton Alerts each won once. However, the CFL does not recognize these wins under one franchise, rather as the individual franchises that won them. If one includes their historical lineage, Hamilton football clubs won league championships in every decade of the 20th century, a feat matched by only one other North American franchise in professional sports, the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings Baseball Club of the International League. After winning at least once in every decade of the 20 th century, neither team won a championship in the first decade of the 21st century. While the Tiger-Cats were only founded in 1950, football in Hamilton goes back much further than that. In fact, Hamilton has one of the oldest traditions of football of any city in the country. Legend has it that the Hamilton Football Club was formed November 3, 1869 in a room above George Lee\u2019s Fruit Store where the team adopted the colours black and yellow. The Tigers played their first game December 18, 1869 against the 13th Battalion (now Royal Hamilton Light Infantry). In 1872, the Hamilton Football Club began play at the Hamilton AAA Grounds and they became known as the Tigers in 1873. By 1883, the Hamilton Tigers began play in the Ontario Rugby Football Union playoffs. There was no regular season then, just playoff rounds to determine the league champion. In 1883, the Tigers lost to the Ottawa F.C. 14-9 in the semi-final. The first championship team in Hamilton football history came in 1890 when the Tigers beat Queen\u2019s University 8-6 in the ORFU final. The ORFU began playing a regular season in 1898 and the Tigers finished second with a 4-2 record. The Tigers won two Canadian Dominion Football Championships in 1906 \u2013 with a 29-3 win over McGill University \u2013 and 1908 \u2013 with a 21-17 win over the University of Toronto. The team continued in the ORFU until 1907 when the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union was formed. The IRFU consisted of the Tigers, Toronto Argonauts, Ottawa Rough Riders and the Montreal Winged Wheelers. The IRFU later became known as the Big Four and eventually the IRFU became the East Division of the modern CFL in the 1950s. The IRFU Tigers faced stiff local competition from the ORFU\u2019s Hamilton Alerts, who in 1912, won the 4 th Grey Cup by beating the Toronto Argonauts 11-4 to become the first team from Hamilton and the first ORFU team to win the championship. The following season in 1913, the Tigers won their first of five Grey Cups, defeating the Toronto Parkdale Canoe Club by a lopsided 44-2 score. The Alerts were refused re-entry into the ORFU in 1913 with many of its players opting to join the Tigers in the IRFU. The Alerts gave way to the Hamilton Rowing Club who played in the ORFU from 1913 to 1915, and by 1914, the Alerts and Tigers were completely amalgamated and continued playing under the name \u201cTigers\u201d in the IRFU. From 1916 to 1918 due to World War I, the IRFU and ORFU suspended play. In the final pre-war season in 1915, the Tigers won the Grey Cup again. At that time, the winning teams were responsible for engraving the Grey Cup which Earl Grey had donated in 1909.

To facilitate the demolition of the old stadium and construction of the new one, the Tiger-Cats played their home games during the 2013 season out of the University of Guelph\u2019s Alumni Stadium and started 2014 playing home games at McMaster University\u2019s Ron Joyce Stadium before moving into their new home at Tim Hortons Field on Labour Day 2014. The 23,218-seat multipurpose stadium has over 1,000 club seats, 30 private suites and social viewing areas that facilitate out-of-seat viewing experiences in both the north and south end zones. On the field, the club gradually returned to respectability. In December 2012, the team hired Kent Austin as Vice President of Football Operations, General Manager and Head Coach. Under Austin from 2013 to 2017, the Tiger-Cats enjoyed their best years in the Young era to date, culminating with back-to-back Grey Cup appearances in 2013 and 2014. With Austin at the helm, the club also earned two East Division titles and three Eastern Final appearances, and finished top-two in the East in four consecutive seasons (2013-16), marking only the second time (1998-2001) the Tiger-Cats had done so since the 1960s. Notable players brought in by Austin included quarterbacks Henry Burris, Zach Collaros and Jeremiah Masoli, receivers Brandon Banks and Luke Tasker, and defensive stalwarts Simoni Lawrence and Ted Laurent. After a brief stint with legendary coach June Jones at the helm in 2017 and 2018, current head coach Orlondo Steinauer will usher in a new era in 2019. Steinauer and his staff, that includes coordinators Mark Washington (defence), Tommy Condell (offence) and Jeff Reinebold (special teams), will look to help the Tiger-Cats claim its first Grey Cup championship since 1999.", "documentFile": "https://ticats.ca/history-of-the-hamilton-tiger-cats-football-club/"}], "set_of_highlights_in_context": [{"source_supports_statement": "complete_support", "docSentText": "\nSince the 1950 merger, the Tiger-Cats have won eight Grey Cup championships, most recently in 1999.", "docSpanText": "Since the 1950 merger, the Tiger-Cats have won eight Grey Cup championships, most recently in 1999.", "docSentCharIdx": 610.0, "problematic_instance": "no", "is_split": "no", "docSpanOffsets": [[611, 710]], "sent_idx": 4.0, "scuSentence": "Hamilton last won the Grey Cup in 1999.", "scuSentCharIdx": 0, "documentFile": "https://ticats.ca/history-of-the-hamilton-tiger-cats-football-club/", "statement_supported": "Yes", "prefix": ""}, {"source_supports_statement": "complete_support", "docSentText": "[5] [6]\nSince the 1950 merger, the team has won the Grey Cup championship eight times, most recently in 1999 .", "docSpanText": "Since the 1950 merger, the team has won the Grey Cup championship eight times, most recently in 1999 .", "docSentCharIdx": 1216.0, "problematic_instance": "no", "is_split": "no", "docSpanOffsets": [[1224, 1326]], "sent_idx": 8.0, "scuSentence": "Hamilton last won the Grey Cup in 1999.", "scuSentCharIdx": 0, "documentFile": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Tiger-Cats", "statement_supported": "Yes", "prefix": ""}, {"source_supports_statement": "complete_support", "docSentText": "The Tiger-Cats have won the Grey Cup a total of eight times, most recently in 1999.", "docSpanText": "The Tiger-Cats have won the Grey Cup a total of eight times, most recently in 1999.", "docSentCharIdx": 404.0, "problematic_instance": "no", "is_split": "no", "docSpanOffsets": [[404, 487]], "sent_idx": 5.0, "scuSentence": "Hamilton last won the Grey Cup in 1999.", "scuSentCharIdx": 0, "documentFile": "https://forum-theatre.com/when-was-the-last-time-hamilton-won-the-grey-cup/", "statement_supported": "Yes", "prefix": ""}], "split": "test", "preceived_utility": "Strongly Agree"}

Announced as the successor to the PlayStation 3 in February 2013, it was launched on November 15, 2013, in North America, November 29, 2013 in Europe, South America and Australia, and on February 22, 2014 in Japan. A console of the eighth generation , it competes with Microsoft 's Xbox One and Nintendo 's Wii U and Switch .\nMoving away from the more complex Cell microarchitecture of its predecessor, the console features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) built upon the x86-64 architecture, which can theoretically peak at 1.84 teraflops ; AMD stated that it was the \"most powerful\" APU it had developed to date. The PlayStation 4 places an increased emphasis on social interaction and integration with other devices and services, including the ability to play games off-console on PlayStation Vita and other supported devices (\" Remote Play \"), the ability to stream gameplay online or to friends, with them controlling gameplay remotely (\"Share Play\"). The console's controller was also redesigned and improved over the PlayStation 3, with improved buttons and analog sticks, and an integrated touchpad among other changes. The console also supports HDR10 High-dynamic-range video and playback of 4K resolution multimedia.\nThe PlayStation 4 was released to critical acclaim, with critics praising Sony for acknowledging its consumers' needs, embracing independent game development , and for not imposing the restrictive digital rights management schemes like those originally announced by Microsoft for the Xbox One. Critics and third-party studios, before its launch, also praised the capabilities of the PlayStation 4 in comparison to its competitors; developers described the performance difference between the console and Xbox One as \"significant\" and \"obvious\". Heightened demand also helped Sony top global console sales. By October 2019, PS4 became the second-best-selling home game console of all time, behind the PlayStation 2 .\nOn September 7, 2016, Sony unveiled the PlayStation 4 Slim, a smaller version of the console; and a high-end version called the PlayStation 4 Pro, which features an upgraded GPU and a higher CPU clock rate to support enhanced performance and 4K resolution in supported games.\nIts successor, the PlayStation 5 , was released in November 2020, with Sony discontinuing in Japan all PlayStation 4 models except the Slim version in January 2021, with it still being produced in Western markets following their statement of 3-year support of PS4.\nAccording to lead architect Mark Cerny , the development of Sony's fourth video game console began as early as 2008. [9] [10]\nLess than two years earlier, the PlayStation 3 had been launched after months of delays due to issues with production. [11] The delay placed Sony almost a year behind Microsoft's Xbox 360 , which was already approaching unit sales of 10 million by the time the PS3 launched. [11] Sony Computer Entertainment Europe CEO Jim Ryan said Sony wanted to avoid repeating the same mistake with PS3's successor. [12]\nIn designing the system, Sony worked with software developer Bungie , who offered their input on the controller and how to make it better for shooting games. [13] In 2012, Sony began shipping development kits to game developers, consisting of a modified PC running the AMD Accelerated Processing Unit chipset. [14] These development kits were known as \"Orbis\". [15] [16]\nIn early 2013, Sony announced that an event known as PlayStation Meeting 2013 would be held in New York City , U.S., on February 20, 2013, to cover the \"future of PlayStation\". [17] [18] Sony officially announced the PlayStation 4 at the event. [19] [20] It revealed details about the console's hardware and discussed some of the new features it would introduce. [19] [21] Sony also showed off real-time footage of games in development, as well as some technical demonstrations. [22] [23] The design of the console was unveiled in June at E3 2013 , and the initial recommended retail prices of $399 (NA), \u20ac399 (Europe), and \u00a3349 (UK) given. [24] [25] Sony took advantage of problems that Microsoft had been having with their positioning of their newly announced Xbox One , which included its higher price point ($499 in North America), as well as strict regulations on how users could share game media. Besides its lower price point, Sony focused on the ease one would have in sharing media with the PS4. [26]\nThe company revealed release dates for North America, Central America, South America, Europe, and Australia, as well as final pieces of information, at a Gamescom press event in Cologne , Germany, on August 20, 2013. The console was released on November 15, 2013, in the United States and Canada , followed by further releases on November 29, 2013. [2] By the end of 2013, the PS4 was launched in more European, Asian and South American countries. [27] [28] The PS4 was released in Japan at \u00a539,980 on February 22, 2014. [29]\nSony finalized a deal with the Chinese government in May 2014 to sell its products in mainland China, and the PS4 will be the first product to be released. Kazuo Hirai , chief executive officer of Sony, said in May: \"The Chinese market, just given the size of it, is obviously potentially a very large market for video game products ... I think that we will be able to replicate the kind of success we have had with PS4 in other parts of the world in China .\" [30]\nIn September 2015, Sony reduced the price of the PS4 in Japan to \u00a534,980, [31] with similar price drops in other Southeast Asian markets. [32] The first official sub-\u00a3300 PS4 bundle was the \u00a3299.99 \"Uncharted Nathan Drake Collection 500GB\", and was released in the UK on October 9, 2015; a 1 TB \u00a3329.99 version was offered at the same time. [33] On October 9, 2015, the first official price cut of the PS4 in North America was announced: a reduction of $50 to $349.99 (US) and by $20 to $429.99 (Canada). [34] [35] [36] An official price cut in Europe followed in late October 2015, reduced to \u20ac349.99/\u00a3299.99. [37]\nOn June 10, 2016, Sony confirmed that a hardware revision of the PlayStation 4, rumored to be codenamed \"Neo\", was under development. The new revision is a higher-end model that is meant to support gameplay in 4K . The new model will be sold alongside the existing model, and all existing software will be compatible between the two models. [38] Layden stated that Sony has no plans to \"bifurcate the market\", only that gamers playing on the Neo will \"have the same experience, but one will be delivered at a higher resolution, with an enhanced graphical experience, but everything else is going to be exactly as you'd expect\". [39] The high-end console was publicly revealed on September 7, 2016, as PlayStation 4 Pro. [40] At the same time, Sony unveiled an updated version of the original PS4 model with a smaller form factor. [41]\nIn May 2018, during a presentation to investors, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO John Kodera stated that the PlayStation 4 was heading into the end of its lifecycle and that the company was anticipating decreasing year-over-year hardware sales. [42] He explained that Sony would be countering the expected decline by focusing on \"strengthen[ing] user engagement\" including continued investments into new first-party games and other online services for PS4. \"We will use the next three years to prepare the next step, to crouch down so that we can jump higher in the future,\" Kodera added in an interview with the press the following day. [43]\nFollowing the launch of the PlayStation 5 in November 2020, Sony discontinued production in Japan of all but the 500GB Slim model of the PlayStation 4 on January 5, 2021, with the standard PS4 and PS4 Pro still being produced for western markets. [44] According to a report from Bloomberg News in January 2022, Sony had been poised to discontinue the PlayStation 4 at the end of 2021 in favor of the PlayStation 5, but due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage that made it difficult for Sony to keep up with PlayStation 5 demand, the company instead planned to continue PlayStation 4 production. Besides helping to offset the PlayStation 5 shortage, this production method would help assure deals with its component providers for the PlayStation 5. [45]\nThe technology in the PlayStation 4 is similar to the hardware found in modern personal computers . [46] This familiarity is designed to make it easier and less expensive for game studios to develop games for the PS4. [47] [48]\n\"[We] have not built an APU quite like that for anyone else in the market. It is by far the most powerful APU we have built to date\".\n- John Taylor, AMD [49]\nThe PlayStation 4 uses an Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) developed by AMD in cooperation with Sony. It combines a central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU), as well as other components such as a memory controller and video decoder . [50] The CPU consists of two 28 nm quad-core Jaguar modules totaling 8 64-bit x86-64 cores , [50] [51] 7 of which are available for game developers to use. [52] The GPU consists of 18 compute units to produce a theoretical peak performance of 1.84 TFLOPS . [23] The system's GDDR5 memory is capable of running at a maximum clock frequency of 2.75 GHz (5500 MT/s) and has a maximum memory bandwidth of 176 GB/s. [23] [53] [54] The console contains 8 GB of GDDR5 memory, [23] [55] 16 times the amount of RAM found in the PS3 and is expected to give the console considerable longevity. [46] [56] It also includes secondary custom chips that handle tasks associated with downloading, uploading, and social gameplay. [57] [58] These tasks can be handled seamlessly in the background during gameplay or while the system is in sleep mode . [59] The console also contains an audio module, which can support in-game chat as well as \"a very large number\" of audio streams for use in-game. [60] All PlayStation 4 models support high dynamic range (HDR) color profiles. [61]\nIts read-only optical drive is capable of reading Blu-ray Discs at speeds of up to three times that of its predecessor. [56] [62] The console features a hardware on-the-fly zlib decompression module. [60] The original PS4 model supports up to 1080p and 1080i video standards, [63] while the Pro model supports 4K resolution . [64] The console includes a 500 gigabyte hard drive for additional storage, [65] which can be upgraded by the user. [66] System Software 4.50, which was released on March 9, 2017, [67] enabled the use of external USB hard drives up to 8 TB for additional storage. [68]\nThe PlayStation 4 features Wi-Fi and Ethernet connectivity, Bluetooth , and two USB 3.0 ports. [23] [56] An auxiliary port is also included for connection to the PlayStation Camera , a motion detection digital camera device first introduced on the PS3. [23] A mono headset, which can be plugged into the DualShock 4, is bundled with the system. [69] Audio/video output options include HDMI TV and optical S/PDIF audio. [23] The console does not have an analog audio/video output. [70]\nThe PS4 features a \" Rest mode \" feature. This places the console in a low-power state while allowing users to immediately resume their game or app once the console is awoken. The console also is able to download content such as game and OS updates while it is in this state. [71] [72]\nThe DualShock 4 is PlayStation 4's primary controller; it maintains a similar design to previous iterations of the DualShock series, but with additional features and design refinements. [73] Among other tweaks, the caps of the analog sticks were given a concave design (similar to the Xbox 360 controller ), the shape of the triggers and shoulder buttons was refined, the D-pad buttons were given a steeper downward angle to provide a resting space in the center for the user's thumb, [73] [74] and the hand grips were made thicker and given microtexturing to improve their feel. [73] [74]\nA major addition to the DualShock 4 is a touchpad ; it is capable of detecting up to two simultaneous touch presses, and can also be pressed down as a button. [73] The \"Start\" and \"Select\" buttons were replaced by \"Options\" and \"Share\" buttons; the latter is designed to allow access to the PlayStation 4's social features (including streaming, video recording, and screenshot tools). [73] [75] The DualShock 4 is powered by a non-removable, rechargeable lithium-ion battery, which can be charged using its micro USB connector. The controller also features an internal speaker, and a headphone jack for headsets or headphones; the console is bundled with a pair of headset earbuds . [76] [77] [73]\nThe controller's motion tracking system is more sensitive than those of the PlayStation 3's controllers. An LED \"light bar\" was additionally added to the front of the controller; it is designed to allow the PlayStation Camera accessory to further track its motion, but can also be used to provide visual effects and feedback within games (such as, for instance, reflecting a player's low health by turning red). [78] [76] [75] [79]\nAlthough the PS4 and DualShock 4 continue to use Bluetooth for wireless connectivity, the console is incompatible with PlayStation 3 controllers. [80] An exception are the PlayStation Move motion controllers originally released for PS3, which are officially supported for use with the PlayStation Camera. [76] [81] In October 2013, Shuhei Yoshida stated on Twitter that the DualShock 4 would support \"basic functions\" when attached to a PC. [82] In August 2016, Sony unveiled an official USB wireless adapter for the DualShock 4, enabling use of all of the controller's functionality on PC. [83] In December 2016, Valve 's Steam platform was updated to provide support and controller customization functionality for DualShock 4, through existing APIs for the Steam Controller . [84] [85]\nA revision of the DualShock 4 was released alongside the \"Slim\" and Pro models in 2016, and is bundled with these systems. It is largely identical to the original model, except that the touchpad now contains a \"stripe\" along the top which the light bar's LED can shine through, and the controller can communicate non-wirelessly when connected to the console over USB. [86]\nMain article: PlayStation Camera\nThe PlayStation Camera is an optional motion sensor and camera for the PlayStation 4, similar to Kinect on Xbox . It includes two 1280\u00d7800 pixel lenses operating with an aperture of f /2.0, with 30 cm focusing distance, and an 85\u00b0 field of view . [69] The dual camera setup allows for different modes of operation, depending on the initiated and running application. [87] The two cameras can be used together for depth-sensing of its surrounding objects in its field of vision. [88] Alternatively, one of the cameras can be used for generating the video image, with the other used for motion tracking. [89]\nPlayStation Camera also features a four-channel microphone array, which helps reduce unwanted background noise and can be used for voice commands. [87] With the PlayStation Camera connected, different users can automatically log-on to the system via face detection . [69]\nMain article: PlayStation VR\nPlayStation VR is a virtual reality system for PlayStation 4; it consists of a headset , which features a 1080p display panel, LED lights on the headset that are used by PlayStation Camera to track its motion, and a control box that processes 3D audio effects , as well as video output to the external display (either simulcasting the player's VR perspective, or providing an asymmetrical secondary perspective). PlayStation VR can also be used with PlayStation Move motion controllers. [90] [91]\nThe PlayStation 4's operating system is called \"Orbis OS\", based upon a customized FreeBSD 9. [92] [93] [94] [95]\nThe console does not require an Internet connection for usage, although more functionality is available when connected. [96] The PS4 is the first to include a WebKit -based web browser, which is a departure from its predecessor's NetFront browser; [ citation needed ] it is based on the same modern WebKit core as Google Chrome and Safari , giving it high compatibility in HTML5 compliance testing. [97]\nThe console introduces a customizable menu interface, the \"PlayStation Dynamic Menu\", featuring a variety of color schemes. [72] The interface displays the player's profile, recent activity, notifications, and other details in addition to unlocked trophies . [98] It allows multiple user accounts, all with their own pass-codes. Each player account has the option to share their real name with friends, or use a nickname in other situations when anonymity is important. Facebook profiles can be connected to PlayStation Network accounts, making it easier to recognize friends. [99] The default home screen features real time content from friends. The \"What's New\" activity feed includes shared media, recently played games, and other notifications. [23] Services from third-party vendors, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video , can be accessed within the interface. [100] Multitasking is available during gameplay, such as opening the browser or managing party chat, and switching between applications is done by double-tapping the \"PS\" button. [23]\nThe PlayStation Camera or a microphone enables the user to control the system using voice input . Players can command the interface to start a game, take screenshots, and save videos. Saying \"PlayStation\" initiates voice control, and \"All Commands\" displays a list of possible commands. [101]\nThe PlayStation 4 supports Blu-ray and DVD playback, including 3D Blu-ray. The playing of CD is no longer supported, [102] as the console no longer has an infrared 780 nm laser. Custom music and video files can still be played from USB drives and DLNA servers using the Media Player app. [103]\nMain article: PlayStation Network\nThe PlayStation 4 allows users to access a variety of free and premium PlayStation Network (PSN) services, including the PlayStation Store , PlayStation Plus subscription service, PlayStation Music powered by Spotify , and the PlayStation Video subscription service, which allows owners to rent or buy TV shows and films \u00e0 la carte . [23] A United States-exclusive cloud-based television-on-demand service known as PlayStation Vue began beta testing in late November 2014. [104] [105] Sony intends to expand and evolve the services it offers over the console's lifespan. [106] Unlike PS3, a PlayStation Plus membership is required to access multiplayer in most games; this requirement does not apply to free-to-play or subscription-based games. [107]\nSmartphones and tablets can interact with the PlayStation 4 as second screen devices, and can also wake the console from sleep mode. [108] A Sony Xperia smartphone, tablet or the PlayStation Vita can be used for streaming gameplay from the console to handheld, allowing supported games to be played remotely from around a household or away from home. [109] [110] Sony has ambitions to make all PS4 games playable on PlayStation Vita. [23] Developers can add Vita-specific controls for use via Remote Play. [111] This feature was later expanded to enable PS4 Remote Play functionality on Microsoft Windows PCs and on Apple OS X Macs. The update, released in April 2016, allows for Remote Play functionality on computers running Windows 8.1 , Windows 10 , OS X Yosemite , and OS X El Capitan . Remote Play supports resolution options of 360p, 540p, and 720p (1080p is available on PS4 Pro), frame rate options of 30\u201360 FPS, and the DualShock 4 can be connected via USB . [112]\nThe PlayStation App allows iOS and Android mobile devices to interact with the PlayStation 4 from their device. The user can use this application to purchase PS4 games from the console and have them remotely downloaded, watch live streams of other gamers, and/or view in-game maps while playing games. [113]\n\"Ustream's integration within PS4 consoles will put gamers on a new media field. They will have the ability to direct, produce, and star in their own video game production, simply by being an awesome (or not so awesome!) gamer.\"\nSony is focused on \"social\" aspects as a major feature of the console. Although the PS4 has improved social functionality, the features are optional and can be disabled. [106]\nUsers have the option to create or join community groups based on personal interest. Communities include a discussion board, accomplishments and game clips shared by other members, plus the ability to join group chat and launch cooperative games. Sony stated that \"communities are a good way to socialize with like-minded players\", particularly when \"you want to tackle a big multiplayer raid, but don't have enough friends available.\" [115] Sony has officially stated that starting April 2021, the community system of the PlayStation Network will be discontinued. This, however, will not prevent users from communicating with their friends in private messaging or in group chats on the PlayStation Network. [116]\nThe DualShock 4 controller includes a \"SHARE\" button, allowing the player to cycle through the last 60 minutes of recorded gameplay to select a screenshot or video clip appropriate for sharing. Media is uploaded seamlessly from the console to other PSN users or social networking sites such as Dailymotion , Facebook , Twitter and YouTube , or else users can copy media to a USB flash drive and upload to a social network or website of their preference. [117] Players can also use a free video editing application named ShareFactory to cut and assemble their favorite video clips and add custom music or voice commentary with green screen effects. Subsequent updates have added options for picture-in-picture layouts, the ability to create photo collages and animated GIFs . [118] [119]\nGamers can either watch live gameplay of games which their friends are playing through the PS4 interface with cross-game camera and microphone input, spectate silently, or broadcast their own gameplay live via DailyMotion , Twitch , [120] Ustream , [23] Niconico , [121] or YouTube Gaming , [115] allowing for friends and members of the public to view and comment upon them from other web browsers and devices. If a user is not screen-casting, a friend can send them a \"Request to Watch\" notification. [115]\n\"SharePlay\" redirects here. For FaceTime feature, see FaceTime \u00a7 History .\nShare Play allows users to invite an online friend to join their play session via streaming, even if they do not own a copy of the game. Users can pass control of the game entirely to the remote user or partake in cooperative multiplayer as if they were physically present. Mark Cerny says that remote assistance is particularly useful when confronted by a potentially game-defeating obstacle. \"You can even see that your friend is in trouble and reach out through the network to take over the controller and assist them through some difficult portion of the game,\" he said. Share Play requires a PlayStation Plus subscription and can only be used for one hour at a time. [122] [123]\nPlayStation 4 games are distributed at retail on Blu-ray Disc , and digitally as downloads through the PlayStation Store . [124] Games are not region-locked, so games purchased in one region can be played on consoles in all regions, [125] and players can sign-on to any PS4 console to access their entire digital game library. [126] All PlayStation 4 games must be installed to the console's storage. [127] Additionally a system called \"PlayGo\" allows users to begin to play portions of a game (such as opening levels) once the installation or download reaches a specific point, while the remainder of the game is downloaded or installed in the background. Updates to games and system software are also downloaded in the background and while in standby. [60] PS4 users will, in the future, be able to browse games and stream games via Gaikai to demo them almost instantaneously. [23] [128] Sony says it is committed to releasing an ever-increasing number of free-to-play games, including PlanetSide 2 and War Thunder . [129] [130] Sony also took steps to make it easier for independent game developers to release games for the PS4 by giving them the option to self-publish their own games rather than rely upon others to distribute their games. [131] [132]\nPlayStation 4 is not compatible with any disc of older PlayStation consoles. [133] [134] Emulated versions of selected PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable games are available for purchase via PlayStation Store, which are upscaled to high definition and have support for PS4 social features. [133] [135]\nMain article: PlayStation Now\nIn December 2013, Andrew House indicated that Sony was planning to launch a cloud gaming service for the PS4 in North America within the third quarter of 2014, with a European launch to follow in 2015. [136] [137]\nAt Consumer Electronics Show on January 7, 2014, Sony unveiled PlayStation Now , a digital distribution service which will initially allow users to access PlayStation 3 games on the PS4 via a cloud-based streaming system, purchasing games individually or via a subscription, as a solution of no backwards compatibility on the hardware of the console. [138] The United States Open Beta went live on July 31, 2014. [139] The official United States release of the service was on January 13, 2015. [140] As of March 2015 PlayStation Now was in closed beta in the United Kingdom. [141]\n\"It's abundantly clear that PS4 is being driven as a collaboration between East and West, as opposed to a dictation from one side to the other. Developers are fully involved, activated, discussed and doing really cool collaborative things.\"\nPre-release reception to the console from developers and journalists was positive. Mark Rein of Epic Games praised the \"enhanced\" architecture of Sony's system, describing it as \"a phenomenal piece of hardware\". [142] John Carmack , programmer and co-founder of id Software , also commended the design by saying \"Sony made wise engineering choices\", [143] while Randy Pitchford of Gearbox Software expressed satisfaction with the amount of high-speed memory in the console. [144] Eurogamer also called the graphics technology in the PS4 \"impressive\" and an improvement from the difficulties developers experienced on the PlayStation 3. [56]\nNumerous industry professionals have acknowledged the PlayStation 4's performance advantage over the Xbox One. Speaking to Edge magazine, multiple game developers have described the difference as \"significant\" and \"obvious\". [145] ExtremeTech says the PS4's graphics processing unit offers a \"serious advantage\" over the competition, but due to the nature of cross-platform development, games that share the same assets will appear \"very similar\". In other scenarios, designers may tap some of PS4's additional power in a straightforward manner, to boost frame rate or output at a higher resolution, whereas games from Sony's own first-party studios that take full advantage of the hardware \"will probably look significantly better than anything on the Xbox One.\" [146]\nIn response to concerns surrounding the possibility of DRM measures to hinder the resale of used games (and in particular, the initial DRM policies of Xbox One , which did contain such restrictions), Jack Tretton explicitly stated during Sony's E3 press conference that there would be \"no restrictions\" on the resale and trading of PS4 games on physical media, while software product development head Scott Rohde specified that Sony was planning to disallow online passes as well, going on to say that the policies were designed to be \"consumer-friendly, extremely retailer-friendly, and extremely publisher-friendly\". [147] [148] After Sony's E3 2013 press conference, IGN responded positively to Sony's attitude towards indie developers and trading games, stating they thought \"most gamers would agree\" that \"if you care about games like [Sony] do, you'll buy a PlayStation 4\". [149] PlayStation 4's removable and upgradable hard drive also drew praise from IGN, [150] with Scott Lowe commenting that the decision gave the console \"another advantage\" over the Xbox One, whose hard drive cannot be accessed. [151]\nGameSpot called the PlayStation 4 \"the gamer's choice for next-generation\", citing its price, lack of restrictive digital rights management , and most importantly, Sony's efforts to \"acknowledge its consumers\" and \"respect its audience\" as major factors. [152]\nThe PlayStation 4 has received very positive reviews by critics. Scott Lowe of IGN gave it an 8.2 rating out of 10 praising the console's DualShock 4 design and social integration features. He criticized the console's lack of software features and for underutilizing the DualShock 4's touch pad. [153] The Gadget Show gave a similar review complimenting the DualShock 4's new triggers and control sticks, in addition to the new Remote Play feature, yet criticized the system's lack of media support at launch. [154] IGN compared the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 over various categories, allowing their readers to vote for their preferred system. The PS4 won every category offered, and IGN awarded the PS4 with their People's Choice Award. [155]\nShortly following the launch, it became apparent that some games released on multiple platforms were available in higher resolutions on the PS4 as opposed to other video game consoles. Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku reported on the differences in early games such as Call of Duty: Ghosts and Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag which ran at 1080p on the PS4, but in 720p and 900p, respectively, on the Xbox One .

In August 2013, Sony announced the placement of over a million preorders for the console, [166] while on the North American launch alone, one million PlayStation 4 consoles were sold. [167] In the UK, the PlayStation 4 became the best-selling console at launch, with the sale of 250,000 consoles within a 48-hour period [168] and 530,000 in the first five weeks. [169]\nOn January 7, 2014, Andrew House announced in his Consumer Electronics Show keynote speech that 4.2 million PS4 units had been sold-through by the end of 2013, [170] with more than 9.7 million software units sold. [171] On February 18, 2014, Sony announced that, as of February 8, it had sold over 5.3 million console units following the release of the PS4 onto the North American and Western/Central European markets. [172] [173] Within the first two days of release in Japan during the weekend of February 22, 2014, 322,083 consoles were sold. [174] PS4 software unit sales surpassed 20.5 million on April 13, 2014. [175] During Japan's 2013 fiscal year , heightened demand for the PS4 helped Sony top global console sales, beating Nintendo for the first time in eight years. [176]\nAccording to data released by Nielsen in August 2014, nine months after the PS4 was released, thirty-one percent of its sales were to existing Wii and Xbox 360 owners, none of whom had by then owned a PS3. [177] At Gamescom 2014, it was announced that 10 million PS4 units had been sold-through to consumers worldwide, [178] and on November 13, it was announced that the PlayStation 4 was the top-selling console in the U.S. for the tenth consecutive month. [179]\nIn its first sales announcement of 2015, Sony confirmed on January 4 that it had sold-through 18.5 million PlayStation 4 units. [180] Sony updated the sell-through figures for the system throughout 2015: over 20 million consoles as of March 3, 2015, [181] over 30 million as of November 22, 2015, [182] and over 35 million by the end of 2015. [183] As of May 22, 2016, total worldwide sell-through reached 40 million. [184] As of December 2018, over 91 million consoles and more than 876 million PlayStation 4 games have been sold worldwide. By October 2019, the PS4 had sold 102.8 million times, making it the second best-selling home video game console of all time, behind the PlayStation 2 . [185]\nThe PlayStation 4 holds a market share of at least 70% within all European countries, as of June 2015.

Successive models have added or removed various features, and each model has variations of Limited Edition consoles.\nOn September 7, 2016, Sony announced a hardware revision of the PlayStation 4, model number CUH-2000, known colloquially as the PlayStation 4 Slim , which phased out the original model. [215] It is a revision of the original PS4 hardware with a smaller form factor; it has a rounded body with a matte finish on the top of the console rather than a two-tone finish, and is 40% smaller in size than the original model. The two USB ports on the front have been updated to the newer USB 3.1 standard and have a larger gap between them, and the optical audio port was removed. [216] This model also features support for USB 3.1, Bluetooth 4.0 and 5.0 GHz Wi-Fi. [217]\nIt was released on September 15, 2016, with a 500 GB model at the same price as the original version of the PlayStation 4. [41] On April 18, 2017, Sony announced that it had replaced this base model with a 1 TB version at the same MSRP. [218]\nThe PlayStation 4 Pro (codenamed Neo , model number CUH-7000) [38] was announced on September 7, 2016, and launched worldwide on November 10, 2016. [219] [220] It is an upgraded version of the PlayStation 4 with improved hardware to enable 4K rendering and improved PlayStation VR performance, including an upgraded GPU with 4.198 teraflops of processing power [221] and hardware support for checkerboard rendering , [222] and a higher CPU clock. As with PS4 \"Slim\", this model also features support for USB 3.1, Bluetooth 4.0 and 5.0 GHz Wi-Fi. [217] The PS4 Pro also includes 1 GB of DDR3 memory that is used to swap out non-gaming applications that run in the background, allowing games to utilize an additional 512 MB of the console's GDDR5 memory. [223] Although capable of streaming 4K video, the PS4 Pro does not support Ultra HD Blu-ray . [224] [225] [226]\nGames marketed by Sony as PS4 Pro Enhanced have specific optimizations when played on this model, such as 4K resolution graphics and/or higher performance. [227] For games not specifically optimized, an option known as \"Boost Mode\" was added on system software 4.5, which can be enabled to force higher CPU and GPU clock rates on existing games to possibly improve performance. [228]\nRendering games at 4K resolution is achieved through various rendering techniques and hardware features; PlayStation technical chief Mark Cerny explained that Sony could not \"brute force\" 4K without compromising form factor and cost, so the console was designed to support \"streamlined rendering techniques\" using custom hardware, \"best-in-breed temporal and spatial anti-aliasing algorithms\", and \"many new features from the AMD Polaris architecture as well as several even beyond it\". The most prominent technique used is checkerboard rendering, wherein the console only renders portions of a scene using a checkerboard pattern, and then uses algorithms to fill in the non-rendered segments. The checkerboarded screen can then be smoothed using an anti-aliasing filter. Hermen Hulst of Guerrilla Games explained that PS4 Pro could render something \"perceptively so close [to 4K] that you wouldn't be able to see the difference\". [229] [230] [231]\nPS4 Pro supports Remote Play, Share Play, and streaming at up to 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second, as well as capturing screenshots at 2160p, and 1080p video at 30 frames per second. [232]\nIn late 2017, Sony issued a new PS4 Pro revision (model number CUH-7100) that featured updated internal components. The actual hardware specifications and performance remained the same as the original model, although it was found that the revised console has a slightly quieter fan profile than the original and as a result was operating at a slightly higher temperature under load than the CUH-7000. In October 2018, Sony quietly issued another revision (model number CUH-7200), initially as part of Red Dead Redemption 2 hardware bundles. The revision has a different power supply which uses the same type of cord as the \"Slim\" model, and was shown to have further improvements to acoustics.

Announced as the successor to the PlayStation 3 in February 2013, it was launched on November 15, 2013, in North America, November 29, 2013 in Europe, South America and Australia, and on February 22, 2014 in Japan. A console of the eighth generation , it competes with Microsoft 's Xbox One and Nintendo 's Wii U and Switch . Moving away from the more complex Cell microarchitecture of its predecessor, the console features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) built upon the x86-64 architecture, which can theoretically peak at 1.84 teraflops ; AMD stated that it was the \"most powerful\" APU it had developed to date. The PlayStation 4 places an increased emphasis on social interaction and integration with other devices and services, including the ability to play games off-console on PlayStation Vita and other supported devices (\" Remote Play \"), the ability to stream gameplay online or to friends, with them controlling gameplay remotely (\"Share Play\"). The console's controller was also redesigned and improved over the PlayStation 3, with improved buttons and analog sticks, and an integrated touchpad among other changes. The console also supports HDR10 High-dynamic-range video and playback of 4K resolution multimedia. The PlayStation 4 was released to critical acclaim, with critics praising Sony for acknowledging its consumers' needs, embracing independent game development , and for not imposing the restrictive digital rights management schemes like those originally announced by Microsoft for the Xbox One. Critics and third-party studios, before its launch, also praised the capabilities of the PlayStation 4 in comparison to its competitors; developers described the performance difference between the console and Xbox One as \"significant\" and \"obvious\". Heightened demand also helped Sony top global console sales. By October 2019, PS4 became the second-best-selling home game console of all time, behind the PlayStation 2 . On September 7, 2016, Sony unveiled the PlayStation 4 Slim, a smaller version of the console; and a high-end version called the PlayStation 4 Pro, which features an upgraded GPU and a higher CPU clock rate to support enhanced performance and 4K resolution in supported games. Its successor, the PlayStation 5 , was released in November 2020, with Sony discontinuing in Japan all PlayStation 4 models except the Slim version in January 2021, with it still being produced in Western markets following their statement of 3-year support of PS4. According to lead architect Mark Cerny , the development of Sony's fourth video game console began as early as 2008. [9] [10] Less than two years earlier, the PlayStation 3 had been launched after months of delays due to issues with production. [11] The delay placed Sony almost a year behind Microsoft's Xbox 360 , which was already approaching unit sales of 10 million by the time the PS3 launched. [11] Sony Computer Entertainment Europe CEO Jim Ryan said Sony wanted to avoid repeating the same mistake with PS3's successor. [12] In designing the system, Sony worked with software developer Bungie , who offered their input on the controller and how to make it better for shooting games. [13] In 2012, Sony began shipping development kits to game developers, consisting of a modified PC running the AMD Accelerated Processing Unit chipset. [14] These development kits were known as \"Orbis\". [15] [16] In early 2013, Sony announced that an event known as PlayStation Meeting 2013 would be held in New York City , U.S., on February 20, 2013, to cover the \"future of PlayStation\". [17] [18] Sony officially announced the PlayStation 4 at the event. [19] [20] It revealed details about the console's hardware and discussed some of the new features it would introduce. [19] [21] Sony also showed off real-time footage of games in development, as well as some technical demonstrations. [22] [23] The design of the console was unveiled in June at E3 2013 , and the initial recommended retail prices of $399 (NA), \u20ac399 (Europe), and \u00a3349 (UK) given. [24] [25] Sony took advantage of problems that Microsoft had been having with their positioning of their newly announced Xbox One , which included its higher price point ($499 in North America), as well as strict regulations on how users could share game media. Besides its lower price point, Sony focused on the ease one would have in sharing media with the PS4. [26] The company revealed release dates for North America, Central America, South America, Europe, and Australia, as well as final pieces of information, at a Gamescom press event in Cologne , Germany, on August 20, 2013. The console was released on November 15, 2013, in the United States and Canada , followed by further releases on November 29, 2013. [2] By the end of 2013, the PS4 was launched in more European, Asian and South American countries. [27] [28] The PS4 was released in Japan at \u00a539,980 on February 22, 2014. [29] Sony finalized a deal with the Chinese government in May 2014 to sell its products in mainland China, and the PS4 will be the first product to be released. Kazuo Hirai , chief executive officer of Sony, said in May: \"The Chinese market, just given the size of it, is obviously potentially a very large market for video game products ... I think that we will be able to replicate the kind of success we have had with PS4 in other parts of the world in China .\" [30] In September 2015, Sony reduced the price of the PS4 in Japan to \u00a534,980, [31] with similar price drops in other Southeast Asian markets. [32] The first official sub-\u00a3300 PS4 bundle was the \u00a3299.99 \"Uncharted Nathan Drake Collection 500GB\", and was released in the UK on October 9, 2015; a 1 TB \u00a3329.99 version was offered at the same time. [33] On October 9, 2015, the first official price cut of the PS4 in North America was announced: a reduction of $50 to $349.99 (US) and by $20 to $429.99 (Canada). [34] [35] [36] An official price cut in Europe followed in late October 2015, reduced to \u20ac349.99/\u00a3299.99. [37] On June 10, 2016, Sony confirmed that a hardware revision of the PlayStation 4, rumored to be codenamed \"Neo\", was under development. The new revision is a higher-end model that is meant to support gameplay in 4K . The new model will be sold alongside the existing model, and all existing software will be compatible between the two models. [38] Layden stated that Sony has no plans to \"bifurcate the market\", only that gamers playing on the Neo will \"have the same experience, but one will be delivered at a higher resolution, with an enhanced graphical experience, but everything else is going to be exactly as you'd expect\". [39] The high-end console was publicly revealed on September 7, 2016, as PlayStation 4 Pro. [40] At the same time, Sony unveiled an updated version of the original PS4 model with a smaller form factor. [41] In May 2018, during a presentation to investors, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO John Kodera stated that the PlayStation 4 was heading into the end of its lifecycle and that the company was anticipating decreasing year-over-year hardware sales. [42] He explained that Sony would be countering the expected decline by focusing on \"strengthen[ing] user engagement\" including continued investments into new first-party games and other online services for PS4. \"We will use the next three years to prepare the next step, to crouch down so that we can jump higher in the future,\" Kodera added in an interview with the press the following day. [43] Following the launch of the PlayStation 5 in November 2020, Sony discontinued production in Japan of all but the 500GB Slim model of the PlayStation 4 on January 5, 2021, with the standard PS4 and PS4 Pro still being produced for western markets. [44] According to a report from Bloomberg News in January 2022, Sony had been poised to discontinue the PlayStation 4 at the end of 2021 in favor of the PlayStation 5, but due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage that made it difficult for Sony to keep up with PlayStation 5 demand, the company instead planned to continue PlayStation 4 production. Besides helping to offset the PlayStation 5 shortage, this production method would help assure deals with its component providers for the PlayStation 5. [45] The technology in the PlayStation 4 is similar to the hardware found in modern personal computers . [46] This familiarity is designed to make it easier and less expensive for game studios to develop games for the PS4. [47] [48] \"[We] have not built an APU quite like that for anyone else in the market. It is by far the most powerful APU we have built to date\". - John Taylor, AMD [49] The PlayStation 4 uses an Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) developed by AMD in cooperation with Sony. It combines a central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU), as well as other components such as a memory controller and video decoder . [50] The CPU consists of two 28 nm quad-core Jaguar modules totaling 8 64-bit x86-64 cores , [50] [51] 7 of which are available for game developers to use. [52] The GPU consists of 18 compute units to produce a theoretical peak performance of 1.84 TFLOPS . [23] The system's GDDR5 memory is capable of running at a maximum clock frequency of 2.75 GHz (5500 MT/s) and has a maximum memory bandwidth of 176 GB/s. [23] [53] [54] The console contains 8 GB of GDDR5 memory, [23] [55] 16 times the amount of RAM found in the PS3 and is expected to give the console considerable longevity. [46] [56] It also includes secondary custom chips that handle tasks associated with downloading, uploading, and social gameplay. [57] [58] These tasks can be handled seamlessly in the background during gameplay or while the system is in sleep mode . [59] The console also contains an audio module, which can support in-game chat as well as \"a very large number\" of audio streams for use in-game. [60] All PlayStation 4 models support high dynamic range (HDR) color profiles. [61] Its read-only optical drive is capable of reading Blu-ray Discs at speeds of up to three times that of its predecessor. [56] [62] The console features a hardware on-the-fly zlib decompression module. [60] The original PS4 model supports up to 1080p and 1080i video standards, [63] while the Pro model supports 4K resolution . [64] The console includes a 500 gigabyte hard drive for additional storage, [65] which can be upgraded by the user. [66] System Software 4.50, which was released on March 9, 2017, [67] enabled the use of external USB hard drives up to 8 TB for additional storage. [68] The PlayStation 4 features Wi-Fi and Ethernet connectivity, Bluetooth , and two USB 3.0 ports. [23] [56] An auxiliary port is also included for connection to the PlayStation Camera , a motion detection digital camera device first introduced on the PS3. [23] A mono headset, which can be plugged into the DualShock 4, is bundled with the system. [69] Audio/video output options include HDMI TV and optical S/PDIF audio. [23] The console does not have an analog audio/video output. [70] The PS4 features a \" Rest mode \" feature. This places the console in a low-power state while allowing users to immediately resume their game or app once the console is awoken. The console also is able to download content such as game and OS updates while it is in this state. [71] [72] The DualShock 4 is PlayStation 4's primary controller; it maintains a similar design to previous iterations of the DualShock series, but with additional features and design refinements. [73] Among other tweaks, the caps of the analog sticks were given a concave design (similar to the Xbox 360 controller ), the shape of the triggers and shoulder buttons was refined, the D-pad buttons were given a steeper downward angle to provide a resting space in the center for the user's thumb, [73] [74] and the hand grips were made thicker and given microtexturing to improve their feel. [73] [74] A major addition to the DualShock 4 is a touchpad ; it is capable of detecting up to two simultaneous touch presses, and can also be pressed down as a button. [73] The \"Start\" and \"Select\" buttons were replaced by \"Options\" and \"Share\" buttons; the latter is designed to allow access to the PlayStation 4's social features (including streaming, video recording, and screenshot tools). [73] [75] The DualShock 4 is powered by a non-removable, rechargeable lithium-ion battery, which can be charged using its micro USB connector. The controller also features an internal speaker, and a headphone jack for headsets or headphones; the console is bundled with a pair of headset earbuds . [76] [77] [73] The controller's motion tracking system is more sensitive than those of the PlayStation 3's controllers. An LED \"light bar\" was additionally added to the front of the controller; it is designed to allow the PlayStation Camera accessory to further track its motion, but can also be used to provide visual effects and feedback within games (such as, for instance, reflecting a player's low health by turning red). [78] [76] [75] [79] Although the PS4 and DualShock 4 continue to use Bluetooth for wireless connectivity, the console is incompatible with PlayStation 3 controllers. [80] An exception are the PlayStation Move motion controllers originally released for PS3, which are officially supported for use with the PlayStation Camera. [76] [81] In October 2013, Shuhei Yoshida stated on Twitter that the DualShock 4 would support \"basic functions\" when attached to a PC. [82] In August 2016, Sony unveiled an official USB wireless adapter for the DualShock 4, enabling use of all of the controller's functionality on PC. [83] In December 2016, Valve 's Steam platform was updated to provide support and controller customization functionality for DualShock 4, through existing APIs for the Steam Controller . [84] [85] A revision of the DualShock 4 was released alongside the \"Slim\" and Pro models in 2016, and is bundled with these systems. It is largely identical to the original model, except that the touchpad now contains a \"stripe\" along the top which the light bar's LED can shine through, and the controller can communicate non-wirelessly when connected to the console over USB. [86] Main article: PlayStation Camera The PlayStation Camera is an optional motion sensor and camera for the PlayStation 4, similar to Kinect on Xbox . It includes two 1280\u00d7800 pixel lenses operating with an aperture of f /2.0, with 30 cm focusing distance, and an 85\u00b0 field of view . [69] The dual camera setup allows for different modes of operation, depending on the initiated and running application. [87] The two cameras can be used together for depth-sensing of its surrounding objects in its field of vision. [88] Alternatively, one of the cameras can be used for generating the video image, with the other used for motion tracking. [89] PlayStation Camera also features a four-channel microphone array, which helps reduce unwanted background noise and can be used for voice commands. [87] With the PlayStation Camera connected, different users can automatically log-on to the system via face detection . [69] Main article: PlayStation VR PlayStation VR is a virtual reality system for PlayStation 4; it consists of a headset , which features a 1080p display panel, LED lights on the headset that are used by PlayStation Camera to track its motion, and a control box that processes 3D audio effects , as well as video output to the external display (either simulcasting the player's VR perspective, or providing an asymmetrical secondary perspective). PlayStation VR can also be used with PlayStation Move motion controllers. [90] [91] The PlayStation 4's operating system is called \"Orbis OS\", based upon a customized FreeBSD 9. [92] [93] [94] [95] The console does not require an Internet connection for usage, although more functionality is available when connected. [96] The PS4 is the first to include a WebKit -based web browser, which is a departure from its predecessor's NetFront browser; [ citation needed ] it is based on the same modern WebKit core as Google Chrome and Safari , giving it high compatibility in HTML5 compliance testing. [97] The console introduces a customizable menu interface, the \"PlayStation Dynamic Menu\", featuring a variety of color schemes. [72] The interface displays the player's profile, recent activity, notifications, and other details in addition to unlocked trophies . [98] It allows multiple user accounts, all with their own pass-codes. Each player account has the option to share their real name with friends, or use a nickname in other situations when anonymity is important. Facebook profiles can be connected to PlayStation Network accounts, making it easier to recognize friends. [99] The default home screen features real time content from friends. The \"What's New\" activity feed includes shared media, recently played games, and other notifications. [23] Services from third-party vendors, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video , can be accessed within the interface. [100] Multitasking is available during gameplay, such as opening the browser or managing party chat, and switching between applications is done by double-tapping the \"PS\" button. [23] The PlayStation Camera or a microphone enables the user to control the system using voice input . Players can command the interface to start a game, take screenshots, and save videos. Saying \"PlayStation\" initiates voice control, and \"All Commands\" displays a list of possible commands. [101] The PlayStation 4 supports Blu-ray and DVD playback, including 3D Blu-ray. The playing of CD is no longer supported, [102] as the console no longer has an infrared 780 nm laser. Custom music and video files can still be played from USB drives and DLNA servers using the Media Player app. [103] Main article: PlayStation Network The PlayStation 4 allows users to access a variety of free and premium PlayStation Network (PSN) services, including the PlayStation Store , PlayStation Plus subscription service, PlayStation Music powered by Spotify , and the PlayStation Video subscription service, which allows owners to rent or buy TV shows and films \u00e0 la carte . [23] A United States-exclusive cloud-based television-on-demand service known as PlayStation Vue began beta testing in late November 2014. [104] [105] Sony intends to expand and evolve the services it offers over the console's lifespan. [106] Unlike PS3, a PlayStation Plus membership is required to access multiplayer in most games; this requirement does not apply to free-to-play or subscription-based games. [107] Smartphones and tablets can interact with the PlayStation 4 as second screen devices, and can also wake the console from sleep mode. [108] A Sony Xperia smartphone, tablet or the PlayStation Vita can be used for streaming gameplay from the console to handheld, allowing supported games to be played remotely from around a household or away from home. [109] [110] Sony has ambitions to make all PS4 games playable on PlayStation Vita. [23] Developers can add Vita-specific controls for use via Remote Play. [111] This feature was later expanded to enable PS4 Remote Play functionality on Microsoft Windows PCs and on Apple OS X Macs. The update, released in April 2016, allows for Remote Play functionality on computers running Windows 8.1 , Windows 10 , OS X Yosemite , and OS X El Capitan . Remote Play supports resolution options of 360p, 540p, and 720p (1080p is available on PS4 Pro), frame rate options of 30\u201360 FPS, and the DualShock 4 can be connected via USB . [112] The PlayStation App allows iOS and Android mobile devices to interact with the PlayStation 4 from their device. The user can use this application to purchase PS4 games from the console and have them remotely downloaded, watch live streams of other gamers, and/or view in-game maps while playing games. [113] \"Ustream's integration within PS4 consoles will put gamers on a new media field. They will have the ability to direct, produce, and star in their own video game production, simply by being an awesome (or not so awesome!) gamer.\" Sony is focused on \"social\" aspects as a major feature of the console. Although the PS4 has improved social functionality, the features are optional and can be disabled. [106] Users have the option to create or join community groups based on personal interest. Communities include a discussion board, accomplishments and game clips shared by other members, plus the ability to join group chat and launch cooperative games. Sony stated that \"communities are a good way to socialize with like-minded players\", particularly when \"you want to tackle a big multiplayer raid, but don't have enough friends available.\" [115] Sony has officially stated that starting April 2021, the community system of the PlayStation Network will be discontinued. This, however, will not prevent users from communicating with their friends in private messaging or in group chats on the PlayStation Network. [116] The DualShock 4 controller includes a \"SHARE\" button, allowing the player to cycle through the last 60 minutes of recorded gameplay to select a screenshot or video clip appropriate for sharing. Media is uploaded seamlessly from the console to other PSN users or social networking sites such as Dailymotion , Facebook , Twitter and YouTube , or else users can copy media to a USB flash drive and upload to a social network or website of their preference. [117] Players can also use a free video editing application named ShareFactory to cut and assemble their favorite video clips and add custom music or voice commentary with green screen effects. Subsequent updates have added options for picture-in-picture layouts, the ability to create photo collages and animated GIFs . [118] [119] Gamers can either watch live gameplay of games which their friends are playing through the PS4 interface with cross-game camera and microphone input, spectate silently, or broadcast their own gameplay live via DailyMotion , Twitch , [120] Ustream , [23] Niconico , [121] or YouTube Gaming , [115] allowing for friends and members of the public to view and comment upon them from other web browsers and devices. If a user is not screen-casting, a friend can send them a \"Request to Watch\" notification. [115] \"SharePlay\" redirects here. For FaceTime feature, see FaceTime \u00a7 History . Share Play allows users to invite an online friend to join their play session via streaming, even if they do not own a copy of the game. Users can pass control of the game entirely to the remote user or partake in cooperative multiplayer as if they were physically present. Mark Cerny says that remote assistance is particularly useful when confronted by a potentially game-defeating obstacle. \"You can even see that your friend is in trouble and reach out through the network to take over the controller and assist them through some difficult portion of the game,\" he said. Share Play requires a PlayStation Plus subscription and can only be used for one hour at a time. [122] [123] PlayStation 4 games are distributed at retail on Blu-ray Disc , and digitally as downloads through the PlayStation Store . [124] Games are not region-locked, so games purchased in one region can be played on consoles in all regions, [125] and players can sign-on to any PS4 console to access their entire digital game library. [126] All PlayStation 4 games must be installed to the console's storage. [127] Additionally a system called \"PlayGo\" allows users to begin to play portions of a game (such as opening levels) once the installation or download reaches a specific point, while the remainder of the game is downloaded or installed in the background. Updates to games and system software are also downloaded in the background and while in standby. [60] PS4 users will, in the future, be able to browse games and stream games via Gaikai to demo them almost instantaneously. [23] [128] Sony says it is committed to releasing an ever-increasing number of free-to-play games, including PlanetSide 2 and War Thunder . [129] [130] Sony also took steps to make it easier for independent game developers to release games for the PS4 by giving them the option to self-publish their own games rather than rely upon others to distribute their games. [131] [132] PlayStation 4 is not compatible with any disc of older PlayStation consoles. [133] [134] Emulated versions of selected PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable games are available for purchase via PlayStation Store, which are upscaled to high definition and have support for PS4 social features. [133] [135] Main article: PlayStation Now In December 2013, Andrew House indicated that Sony was planning to launch a cloud gaming service for the PS4 in North America within the third quarter of 2014, with a European launch to follow in 2015. [136] [137] At Consumer Electronics Show on January 7, 2014, Sony unveiled PlayStation Now , a digital distribution service which will initially allow users to access PlayStation 3 games on the PS4 via a cloud-based streaming system, purchasing games individually or via a subscription, as a solution of no backwards compatibility on the hardware of the console. [138] The United States Open Beta went live on July 31, 2014. [139] The official United States release of the service was on January 13, 2015. [140] As of March 2015 PlayStation Now was in closed beta in the United Kingdom. [141] \"It's abundantly clear that PS4 is being driven as a collaboration between East and West, as opposed to a dictation from one side to the other. Developers are fully involved, activated, discussed and doing really cool collaborative things.\" Pre-release reception to the console from developers and journalists was positive. Mark Rein of Epic Games praised the \"enhanced\" architecture of Sony's system, describing it as \"a phenomenal piece of hardware\". [142] John Carmack , programmer and co-founder of id Software , also commended the design by saying \"Sony made wise engineering choices\", [143] while Randy Pitchford of Gearbox Software expressed satisfaction with the amount of high-speed memory in the console. [144] Eurogamer also called the graphics technology in the PS4 \"impressive\" and an improvement from the difficulties developers experienced on the PlayStation 3. [56] Numerous industry professionals have acknowledged the PlayStation 4's performance advantage over the Xbox One. Speaking to Edge magazine, multiple game developers have described the difference as \"significant\" and \"obvious\". [145] ExtremeTech says the PS4's graphics processing unit offers a \"serious advantage\" over the competition, but due to the nature of cross-platform development, games that share the same assets will appear \"very similar\". In other scenarios, designers may tap some of PS4's additional power in a straightforward manner, to boost frame rate or output at a higher resolution, whereas games from Sony's own first-party studios that take full advantage of the hardware \"will probably look significantly better than anything on the Xbox One.\" [146] In response to concerns surrounding the possibility of DRM measures to hinder the resale of used games (and in particular, the initial DRM policies of Xbox One , which did contain such restrictions), Jack Tretton explicitly stated during Sony's E3 press conference that there would be \"no restrictions\" on the resale and trading of PS4 games on physical media, while software product development head Scott Rohde specified that Sony was planning to disallow online passes as well, going on to say that the policies were designed to be \"consumer-friendly, extremely retailer-friendly, and extremely publisher-friendly\". [147] [148] After Sony's E3 2013 press conference, IGN responded positively to Sony's attitude towards indie developers and trading games, stating they thought \"most gamers would agree\" that \"if you care about games like [Sony] do, you'll buy a PlayStation 4\". [149] PlayStation 4's removable and upgradable hard drive also drew praise from IGN, [150] with Scott Lowe commenting that the decision gave the console \"another advantage\" over the Xbox One, whose hard drive cannot be accessed. [151] GameSpot called the PlayStation 4 \"the gamer's choice for next-generation\", citing its price, lack of restrictive digital rights management , and most importantly, Sony's efforts to \"acknowledge its consumers\" and \"respect its audience\" as major factors. [152] The PlayStation 4 has received very positive reviews by critics. Scott Lowe of IGN gave it an 8.2 rating out of 10 praising the console's DualShock 4 design and social integration features. He criticized the console's lack of software features and for underutilizing the DualShock 4's touch pad. [153] The Gadget Show gave a similar review complimenting the DualShock 4's new triggers and control sticks, in addition to the new Remote Play feature, yet criticized the system's lack of media support at launch. [154] IGN compared the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 over various categories, allowing their readers to vote for their preferred system. The PS4 won every category offered, and IGN awarded the PS4 with their People's Choice Award. [155] Shortly following the launch, it became apparent that some games released on multiple platforms were available in higher resolutions on the PS4 as opposed to other video game consoles. Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku reported on the differences in early games such as Call of Duty: Ghosts and Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag which ran at 1080p on the PS4, but in 720p and 900p, respectively, on the Xbox One . [156] Region Lifetime sell-through by region Lifetime sell-through by country North America 30M United States 30M (as of September 2019) [157] [158] Europe ~24M  Germany 7.2M  (as of September\u00a02019)  ;  [157]  [158]  United Kingdom 6.8M (as of September 2019) ; [157] [158] France ~6M (as of September 2019) ; [158] Italy ~3M (as of December 2018) ; [159] Spain 700K (as of June 17, 2015) ; [160] Portugal 100K (as of May 4, 2015) [161] Asia +10M  Japan 8.3M  (as of September\u00a02019)  ;  [157]  [158]  China ~1.5M (as of August 2, 2018) ; [162] India ~250,000 (as of March 2018) [163] Others 200,000  Mexico, Brazil, Argentina ~150,000  (as of December\u00a02014)  ;  [164]  South Africa 50,000 (as of December 12, 2014) [165] Worldwide 106.0M (as of December 31, 2019) [4] Demand for PlayStation 4 was strong. In August 2013, Sony announced the placement of over a million preorders for the console, [166] while on the North American launch alone, one million PlayStation 4 consoles were sold. [167] In the UK, the PlayStation 4 became the best-selling console at launch, with the sale of 250,000 consoles within a 48-hour period [168] and 530,000 in the first five weeks. [169] On January 7, 2014, Andrew House announced in his Consumer Electronics Show keynote speech that 4.2 million PS4 units had been sold-through by the end of 2013, [170] with more than 9.7 million software units sold. [171] On February 18, 2014, Sony announced that, as of February 8, it had sold over 5.3 million console units following the release of the PS4 onto the North American and Western/Central European markets. [172] [173] Within the first two days of release in Japan during the weekend of February 22, 2014, 322,083 consoles were sold. [174] PS4 software unit sales surpassed 20.5 million on April 13, 2014. [175] During Japan's 2013 fiscal year , heightened demand for the PS4 helped Sony top global console sales, beating Nintendo for the first time in eight years. [176] According to data released by Nielsen in August 2014, nine months after the PS4 was released, thirty-one percent of its sales were to existing Wii and Xbox 360 owners, none of whom had by then owned a PS3. [177] At Gamescom 2014, it was announced that 10 million PS4 units had been sold-through to consumers worldwide, [178] and on November 13, it was announced that the PlayStation 4 was the top-selling console in the U.S. for the tenth consecutive month. [179] In its first sales announcement of 2015, Sony confirmed on January 4 that it had sold-through 18.5 million PlayStation 4 units. [180] Sony updated the sell-through figures for the system throughout 2015: over 20 million consoles as of March 3, 2015, [181] over 30 million as of November 22, 2015, [182] and over 35 million by the end of 2015. [183] As of May 22, 2016, total worldwide sell-through reached 40 million. [184] As of December 2018, over 91 million consoles and more than 876 million PlayStation 4 games have been sold worldwide. By October 2019, the PS4 had sold 102.8 million times, making it the second best-selling home video game console of all time, behind the PlayStation 2 . [185] The PlayStation 4 holds a market share of at least 70% within all European countries, as of June 2015.

(as of March, 2021) The PlayStation 4 has been produced in various models: the original, the Slim, and the Pro. Successive models have added or removed various features, and each model has variations of Limited Edition consoles. On September 7, 2016, Sony announced a hardware revision of the PlayStation 4, model number CUH-2000, known colloquially as the PlayStation 4 Slim , which phased out the original model. [215] It is a revision of the original PS4 hardware with a smaller form factor; it has a rounded body with a matte finish on the top of the console rather than a two-tone finish, and is 40% smaller in size than the original model. The two USB ports on the front have been updated to the newer USB 3.1 standard and have a larger gap between them, and the optical audio port was removed. [216] This model also features support for USB 3.1, Bluetooth 4.0 and 5.0 GHz Wi-Fi. [217] It was released on September 15, 2016, with a 500 GB model at the same price as the original version of the PlayStation 4. [41] On April 18, 2017, Sony announced that it had replaced this base model with a 1 TB version at the same MSRP. [218] The PlayStation 4 Pro (codenamed Neo , model number CUH-7000) [38] was announced on September 7, 2016, and launched worldwide on November 10, 2016. [219] [220] It is an upgraded version of the PlayStation 4 with improved hardware to enable 4K rendering and improved PlayStation VR performance, including an upgraded GPU with 4.198 teraflops of processing power [221] and hardware support for checkerboard rendering , [222] and a higher CPU clock. As with PS4 \"Slim\", this model also features support for USB 3.1, Bluetooth 4.0 and 5.0 GHz Wi-Fi. [217] The PS4 Pro also includes 1 GB of DDR3 memory that is used to swap out non-gaming applications that run in the background, allowing games to utilize an additional 512 MB of the console's GDDR5 memory. [223] Although capable of streaming 4K video, the PS4 Pro does not support Ultra HD Blu-ray . [224] [225] [226] Games marketed by Sony as PS4 Pro Enhanced have specific optimizations when played on this model, such as 4K resolution graphics and/or higher performance. [227] For games not specifically optimized, an option known as \"Boost Mode\" was added on system software 4.5, which can be enabled to force higher CPU and GPU clock rates on existing games to possibly improve performance. [228] Rendering games at 4K resolution is achieved through various rendering techniques and hardware features; PlayStation technical chief Mark Cerny explained that Sony could not \"brute force\" 4K without compromising form factor and cost, so the console was designed to support \"streamlined rendering techniques\" using custom hardware, \"best-in-breed temporal and spatial anti-aliasing algorithms\", and \"many new features from the AMD Polaris architecture as well as several even beyond it\". The most prominent technique used is checkerboard rendering, wherein the console only renders portions of a scene using a checkerboard pattern, and then uses algorithms to fill in the non-rendered segments. The checkerboarded screen can then be smoothed using an anti-aliasing filter. Hermen Hulst of Guerrilla Games explained that PS4 Pro could render something \"perceptively so close [to 4K] that you wouldn't be able to see the difference\". [229] [230] [231] PS4 Pro supports Remote Play, Share Play, and streaming at up to 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second, as well as capturing screenshots at 2160p, and 1080p video at 30 frames per second. [232] In late 2017, Sony issued a new PS4 Pro revision (model number CUH-7100) that featured updated internal components. The actual hardware specifications and performance remained the same as the original model, although it was found that the revised console has a slightly quieter fan profile than the original and as a result was operating at a slightly higher temperature under load than the CUH-7000. In October 2018, Sony quietly issued another revision (model number CUH-7200), initially as part of Red Dead Redemption 2 hardware bundles. The revision has a different power supply which uses the same type of cord as the \"Slim\" model, and was shown to have further improvements to acoustics.

Announced as the successor to the PlayStation 3 in February 2013, it was launched on November 15, 2013, in North America, November 29, 2013 in Europe, South America and Australia, and on February 22, 2014 in Japan. A console of the eighth generation , it competes with Microsoft 's Xbox One and Nintendo 's Wii U and Switch .\nMoving away from the more complex Cell microarchitecture of its predecessor, the console features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) built upon the x86-64 architecture, which can theoretically peak at 1.84 teraflops ; AMD stated that it was the \"most powerful\" APU it had developed to date. The PlayStation 4 places an increased emphasis on social interaction and integration with other devices and services, including the ability to play games off-console on PlayStation Vita and other supported devices (\" Remote Play \"), the ability to stream gameplay online or to friends, with them controlling gameplay remotely (\"Share Play\"). The console's controller was also redesigned and improved over the PlayStation 3, with improved buttons and analog sticks, and an integrated touchpad among other changes. The console also supports HDR10 High-dynamic-range video and playback of 4K resolution multimedia.\nThe PlayStation 4 was released to critical acclaim, with critics praising Sony for acknowledging its consumers' needs, embracing independent game development , and for not imposing the restrictive digital rights management schemes like those originally announced by Microsoft for the Xbox One. Critics and third-party studios, before its launch, also praised the capabilities of the PlayStation 4 in comparison to its competitors; developers described the performance difference between the console and Xbox One as \"significant\" and \"obvious\". Heightened demand also helped Sony top global console sales. By October 2019, PS4 became the second-best-selling home game console of all time, behind the PlayStation 2 .\nOn September 7, 2016, Sony unveiled the PlayStation 4 Slim, a smaller version of the console; and a high-end version called the PlayStation 4 Pro, which features an upgraded GPU and a higher CPU clock rate to support enhanced performance and 4K resolution in supported games.\nIts successor, the PlayStation 5 , was released in November 2020, with Sony discontinuing in Japan all PlayStation 4 models except the Slim version in January 2021, with it still being produced in Western markets following their statement of 3-year support of PS4.\nAccording to lead architect Mark Cerny , the development of Sony's fourth video game console began as early as 2008. [9] [10]\nLess than two years earlier, the PlayStation 3 had been launched after months of delays due to issues with production. [11] The delay placed Sony almost a year behind Microsoft's Xbox 360 , which was already approaching unit sales of 10 million by the time the PS3 launched. [11] Sony Computer Entertainment Europe CEO Jim Ryan said Sony wanted to avoid repeating the same mistake with PS3's successor. [12]\nIn designing the system, Sony worked with software developer Bungie , who offered their input on the controller and how to make it better for shooting games. [13] In 2012, Sony began shipping development kits to game developers, consisting of a modified PC running the AMD Accelerated Processing Unit chipset. [14] These development kits were known as \"Orbis\". [15] [16]\nIn early 2013, Sony announced that an event known as PlayStation Meeting 2013 would be held in New York City , U.S., on February 20, 2013, to cover the \"future of PlayStation\". [17] [18] Sony officially announced the PlayStation 4 at the event. [19] [20] It revealed details about the console's hardware and discussed some of the new features it would introduce. [19] [21] Sony also showed off real-time footage of games in development, as well as some technical demonstrations. [22] [23] The design of the console was unveiled in June at E3 2013 , and the initial recommended retail prices of $399 (NA), \u20ac399 (Europe), and \u00a3349 (UK) given. [24] [25] Sony took advantage of problems that Microsoft had been having with their positioning of their newly announced Xbox One , which included its higher price point ($499 in North America), as well as strict regulations on how users could share game media. Besides its lower price point, Sony focused on the ease one would have in sharing media with the PS4. [26]\nThe company revealed release dates for North America, Central America, South America, Europe, and Australia, as well as final pieces of information, at a Gamescom press event in Cologne , Germany, on August 20, 2013. The console was released on November 15, 2013, in the United States and Canada , followed by further releases on November 29, 2013. [2] By the end of 2013, the PS4 was launched in more European, Asian and South American countries. [27] [28] The PS4 was released in Japan at \u00a539,980 on February 22, 2014. [29]\nSony finalized a deal with the Chinese government in May 2014 to sell its products in mainland China, and the PS4 will be the first product to be released. Kazuo Hirai , chief executive officer of Sony, said in May: \"The Chinese market, just given the size of it, is obviously potentially a very large market for video game products ... I think that we will be able to replicate the kind of success we have had with PS4 in other parts of the world in China .\" [30]\nIn September 2015, Sony reduced the price of the PS4 in Japan to \u00a534,980, [31] with similar price drops in other Southeast Asian markets. [32] The first official sub-\u00a3300 PS4 bundle was the \u00a3299.99 \"Uncharted Nathan Drake Collection 500GB\", and was released in the UK on October 9, 2015; a 1 TB \u00a3329.99 version was offered at the same time. [33] On October 9, 2015, the first official price cut of the PS4 in North America was announced: a reduction of $50 to $349.99 (US) and by $20 to $429.99 (Canada). [34] [35] [36] An official price cut in Europe followed in late October 2015, reduced to \u20ac349.99/\u00a3299.99. [37]\nOn June 10, 2016, Sony confirmed that a hardware revision of the PlayStation 4, rumored to be codenamed \"Neo\", was under development. The new revision is a higher-end model that is meant to support gameplay in 4K . The new model will be sold alongside the existing model, and all existing software will be compatible between the two models. [38] Layden stated that Sony has no plans to \"bifurcate the market\", only that gamers playing on the Neo will \"have the same experience, but one will be delivered at a higher resolution, with an enhanced graphical experience, but everything else is going to be exactly as you'd expect\". [39] The high-end console was publicly revealed on September 7, 2016, as PlayStation 4 Pro. [40] At the same time, Sony unveiled an updated version of the original PS4 model with a smaller form factor. [41]\nIn May 2018, during a presentation to investors, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO John Kodera stated that the PlayStation 4 was heading into the end of its lifecycle and that the company was anticipating decreasing year-over-year hardware sales. [42] He explained that Sony would be countering the expected decline by focusing on \"strengthen[ing] user engagement\" including continued investments into new first-party games and other online services for PS4. \"We will use the next three years to prepare the next step, to crouch down so that we can jump higher in the future,\" Kodera added in an interview with the press the following day. [43]\nFollowing the launch of the PlayStation 5 in November 2020, Sony discontinued production in Japan of all but the 500GB Slim model of the PlayStation 4 on January 5, 2021, with the standard PS4 and PS4 Pro still being produced for western markets. [44] According to a report from Bloomberg News in January 2022, Sony had been poised to discontinue the PlayStation 4 at the end of 2021 in favor of the PlayStation 5, but due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage that made it difficult for Sony to keep up with PlayStation 5 demand, the company instead planned to continue PlayStation 4 production. Besides helping to offset the PlayStation 5 shortage, this production method would help assure deals with its component providers for the PlayStation 5. [45]\nThe technology in the PlayStation 4 is similar to the hardware found in modern personal computers . [46] This familiarity is designed to make it easier and less expensive for game studios to develop games for the PS4. [47] [48]\n\"[We] have not built an APU quite like that for anyone else in the market. It is by far the most powerful APU we have built to date\".\n- John Taylor, AMD [49]\nThe PlayStation 4 uses an Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) developed by AMD in cooperation with Sony. It combines a central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU), as well as other components such as a memory controller and video decoder . [50] The CPU consists of two 28 nm quad-core Jaguar modules totaling 8 64-bit x86-64 cores , [50] [51] 7 of which are available for game developers to use. [52] The GPU consists of 18 compute units to produce a theoretical peak performance of 1.84 TFLOPS . [23] The system's GDDR5 memory is capable of running at a maximum clock frequency of 2.75 GHz (5500 MT/s) and has a maximum memory bandwidth of 176 GB/s. [23] [53] [54] The console contains 8 GB of GDDR5 memory, [23] [55] 16 times the amount of RAM found in the PS3 and is expected to give the console considerable longevity. [46] [56] It also includes secondary custom chips that handle tasks associated with downloading, uploading, and social gameplay. [57] [58] These tasks can be handled seamlessly in the background during gameplay or while the system is in sleep mode . [59] The console also contains an audio module, which can support in-game chat as well as \"a very large number\" of audio streams for use in-game. [60] All PlayStation 4 models support high dynamic range (HDR) color profiles. [61]\nIts read-only optical drive is capable of reading Blu-ray Discs at speeds of up to three times that of its predecessor. [56] [62] The console features a hardware on-the-fly zlib decompression module. [60] The original PS4 model supports up to 1080p and 1080i video standards, [63] while the Pro model supports 4K resolution . [64] The console includes a 500 gigabyte hard drive for additional storage, [65] which can be upgraded by the user. [66] System Software 4.50, which was released on March 9, 2017, [67] enabled the use of external USB hard drives up to 8 TB for additional storage. [68]\nThe PlayStation 4 features Wi-Fi and Ethernet connectivity, Bluetooth , and two USB 3.0 ports. [23] [56] An auxiliary port is also included for connection to the PlayStation Camera , a motion detection digital camera device first introduced on the PS3. [23] A mono headset, which can be plugged into the DualShock 4, is bundled with the system. [69] Audio/video output options include HDMI TV and optical S/PDIF audio. [23] The console does not have an analog audio/video output. [70]\nThe PS4 features a \" Rest mode \" feature. This places the console in a low-power state while allowing users to immediately resume their game or app once the console is awoken. The console also is able to download content such as game and OS updates while it is in this state. [71] [72]\nThe DualShock 4 is PlayStation 4's primary controller; it maintains a similar design to previous iterations of the DualShock series, but with additional features and design refinements. [73] Among other tweaks, the caps of the analog sticks were given a concave design (similar to the Xbox 360 controller ), the shape of the triggers and shoulder buttons was refined, the D-pad buttons were given a steeper downward angle to provide a resting space in the center for the user's thumb, [73] [74] and the hand grips were made thicker and given microtexturing to improve their feel. [73] [74]\nA major addition to the DualShock 4 is a touchpad ; it is capable of detecting up to two simultaneous touch presses, and can also be pressed down as a button. [73] The \"Start\" and \"Select\" buttons were replaced by \"Options\" and \"Share\" buttons; the latter is designed to allow access to the PlayStation 4's social features (including streaming, video recording, and screenshot tools). [73] [75] The DualShock 4 is powered by a non-removable, rechargeable lithium-ion battery, which can be charged using its micro USB connector. The controller also features an internal speaker, and a headphone jack for headsets or headphones; the console is bundled with a pair of headset earbuds . [76] [77] [73]\nThe controller's motion tracking system is more sensitive than those of the PlayStation 3's controllers. An LED \"light bar\" was additionally added to the front of the controller; it is designed to allow the PlayStation Camera accessory to further track its motion, but can also be used to provide visual effects and feedback within games (such as, for instance, reflecting a player's low health by turning red). [78] [76] [75] [79]\nAlthough the PS4 and DualShock 4 continue to use Bluetooth for wireless connectivity, the console is incompatible with PlayStation 3 controllers. [80] An exception are the PlayStation Move motion controllers originally released for PS3, which are officially supported for use with the PlayStation Camera. [76] [81] In October 2013, Shuhei Yoshida stated on Twitter that the DualShock 4 would support \"basic functions\" when attached to a PC. [82] In August 2016, Sony unveiled an official USB wireless adapter for the DualShock 4, enabling use of all of the controller's functionality on PC. [83] In December 2016, Valve 's Steam platform was updated to provide support and controller customization functionality for DualShock 4, through existing APIs for the Steam Controller . [84] [85]\nA revision of the DualShock 4 was released alongside the \"Slim\" and Pro models in 2016, and is bundled with these systems. It is largely identical to the original model, except that the touchpad now contains a \"stripe\" along the top which the light bar's LED can shine through, and the controller can communicate non-wirelessly when connected to the console over USB. [86]\nMain article: PlayStation Camera\nThe PlayStation Camera is an optional motion sensor and camera for the PlayStation 4, similar to Kinect on Xbox . It includes two 1280\u00d7800 pixel lenses operating with an aperture of f /2.0, with 30 cm focusing distance, and an 85\u00b0 field of view . [69] The dual camera setup allows for different modes of operation, depending on the initiated and running application. [87] The two cameras can be used together for depth-sensing of its surrounding objects in its field of vision. [88] Alternatively, one of the cameras can be used for generating the video image, with the other used for motion tracking. [89]\nPlayStation Camera also features a four-channel microphone array, which helps reduce unwanted background noise and can be used for voice commands. [87] With the PlayStation Camera connected, different users can automatically log-on to the system via face detection . [69]\nMain article: PlayStation VR\nPlayStation VR is a virtual reality system for PlayStation 4; it consists of a headset , which features a 1080p display panel, LED lights on the headset that are used by PlayStation Camera to track its motion, and a control box that processes 3D audio effects , as well as video output to the external display (either simulcasting the player's VR perspective, or providing an asymmetrical secondary perspective). PlayStation VR can also be used with PlayStation Move motion controllers. [90] [91]\nThe PlayStation 4's operating system is called \"Orbis OS\", based upon a customized FreeBSD 9. [92] [93] [94] [95]\nThe console does not require an Internet connection for usage, although more functionality is available when connected. [96] The PS4 is the first to include a WebKit -based web browser, which is a departure from its predecessor's NetFront browser; [ citation needed ] it is based on the same modern WebKit core as Google Chrome and Safari , giving it high compatibility in HTML5 compliance testing. [97]\nThe console introduces a customizable menu interface, the \"PlayStation Dynamic Menu\", featuring a variety of color schemes. [72] The interface displays the player's profile, recent activity, notifications, and other details in addition to unlocked trophies . [98] It allows multiple user accounts, all with their own pass-codes. Each player account has the option to share their real name with friends, or use a nickname in other situations when anonymity is important. Facebook profiles can be connected to PlayStation Network accounts, making it easier to recognize friends. [99] The default home screen features real time content from friends. The \"What's New\" activity feed includes shared media, recently played games, and other notifications. [23] Services from third-party vendors, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video , can be accessed within the interface. [100] Multitasking is available during gameplay, such as opening the browser or managing party chat, and switching between applications is done by double-tapping the \"PS\" button. [23]\nThe PlayStation Camera or a microphone enables the user to control the system using voice input . Players can command the interface to start a game, take screenshots, and save videos. Saying \"PlayStation\" initiates voice control, and \"All Commands\" displays a list of possible commands. [101]\nThe PlayStation 4 supports Blu-ray and DVD playback, including 3D Blu-ray. The playing of CD is no longer supported, [102] as the console no longer has an infrared 780 nm laser. Custom music and video files can still be played from USB drives and DLNA servers using the Media Player app. [103]\nMain article: PlayStation Network\nThe PlayStation 4 allows users to access a variety of free and premium PlayStation Network (PSN) services, including the PlayStation Store , PlayStation Plus subscription service, PlayStation Music powered by Spotify , and the PlayStation Video subscription service, which allows owners to rent or buy TV shows and films \u00e0 la carte . [23] A United States-exclusive cloud-based television-on-demand service known as PlayStation Vue began beta testing in late November 2014. [104] [105] Sony intends to expand and evolve the services it offers over the console's lifespan. [106] Unlike PS3, a PlayStation Plus membership is required to access multiplayer in most games; this requirement does not apply to free-to-play or subscription-based games. [107]\nSmartphones and tablets can interact with the PlayStation 4 as second screen devices, and can also wake the console from sleep mode. [108] A Sony Xperia smartphone, tablet or the PlayStation Vita can be used for streaming gameplay from the console to handheld, allowing supported games to be played remotely from around a household or away from home. [109] [110] Sony has ambitions to make all PS4 games playable on PlayStation Vita. [23] Developers can add Vita-specific controls for use via Remote Play. [111] This feature was later expanded to enable PS4 Remote Play functionality on Microsoft Windows PCs and on Apple OS X Macs. The update, released in April 2016, allows for Remote Play functionality on computers running Windows 8.1 , Windows 10 , OS X Yosemite , and OS X El Capitan . Remote Play supports resolution options of 360p, 540p, and 720p (1080p is available on PS4 Pro), frame rate options of 30\u201360 FPS, and the DualShock 4 can be connected via USB . [112]\nThe PlayStation App allows iOS and Android mobile devices to interact with the PlayStation 4 from their device. The user can use this application to purchase PS4 games from the console and have them remotely downloaded, watch live streams of other gamers, and/or view in-game maps while playing games. [113]\n\"Ustream's integration within PS4 consoles will put gamers on a new media field. They will have the ability to direct, produce, and star in their own video game production, simply by being an awesome (or not so awesome!) gamer.\"\nSony is focused on \"social\" aspects as a major feature of the console. Although the PS4 has improved social functionality, the features are optional and can be disabled. [106]\nUsers have the option to create or join community groups based on personal interest. Communities include a discussion board, accomplishments and game clips shared by other members, plus the ability to join group chat and launch cooperative games. Sony stated that \"communities are a good way to socialize with like-minded players\", particularly when \"you want to tackle a big multiplayer raid, but don't have enough friends available.\" [115] Sony has officially stated that starting April 2021, the community system of the PlayStation Network will be discontinued. This, however, will not prevent users from communicating with their friends in private messaging or in group chats on the PlayStation Network. [116]\nThe DualShock 4 controller includes a \"SHARE\" button, allowing the player to cycle through the last 60 minutes of recorded gameplay to select a screenshot or video clip appropriate for sharing. Media is uploaded seamlessly from the console to other PSN users or social networking sites such as Dailymotion , Facebook , Twitter and YouTube , or else users can copy media to a USB flash drive and upload to a social network or website of their preference. [117] Players can also use a free video editing application named ShareFactory to cut and assemble their favorite video clips and add custom music or voice commentary with green screen effects. Subsequent updates have added options for picture-in-picture layouts, the ability to create photo collages and animated GIFs . [118] [119]\nGamers can either watch live gameplay of games which their friends are playing through the PS4 interface with cross-game camera and microphone input, spectate silently, or broadcast their own gameplay live via DailyMotion , Twitch , [120] Ustream , [23] Niconico , [121] or YouTube Gaming , [115] allowing for friends and members of the public to view and comment upon them from other web browsers and devices. If a user is not screen-casting, a friend can send them a \"Request to Watch\" notification. [115]\n\"SharePlay\" redirects here. For FaceTime feature, see FaceTime \u00a7 History .\nShare Play allows users to invite an online friend to join their play session via streaming, even if they do not own a copy of the game. Users can pass control of the game entirely to the remote user or partake in cooperative multiplayer as if they were physically present. Mark Cerny says that remote assistance is particularly useful when confronted by a potentially game-defeating obstacle. \"You can even see that your friend is in trouble and reach out through the network to take over the controller and assist them through some difficult portion of the game,\" he said. Share Play requires a PlayStation Plus subscription and can only be used for one hour at a time. [122] [123]\nPlayStation 4 games are distributed at retail on Blu-ray Disc , and digitally as downloads through the PlayStation Store . [124] Games are not region-locked, so games purchased in one region can be played on consoles in all regions, [125] and players can sign-on to any PS4 console to access their entire digital game library. [126] All PlayStation 4 games must be installed to the console's storage. [127] Additionally a system called \"PlayGo\" allows users to begin to play portions of a game (such as opening levels) once the installation or download reaches a specific point, while the remainder of the game is downloaded or installed in the background. Updates to games and system software are also downloaded in the background and while in standby. [60] PS4 users will, in the future, be able to browse games and stream games via Gaikai to demo them almost instantaneously. [23] [128] Sony says it is committed to releasing an ever-increasing number of free-to-play games, including PlanetSide 2 and War Thunder . [129] [130] Sony also took steps to make it easier for independent game developers to release games for the PS4 by giving them the option to self-publish their own games rather than rely upon others to distribute their games. [131] [132]\nPlayStation 4 is not compatible with any disc of older PlayStation consoles. [133] [134] Emulated versions of selected PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable games are available for purchase via PlayStation Store, which are upscaled to high definition and have support for PS4 social features. [133] [135]\nMain article: PlayStation Now\nIn December 2013, Andrew House indicated that Sony was planning to launch a cloud gaming service for the PS4 in North America within the third quarter of 2014, with a European launch to follow in 2015. [136] [137]\nAt Consumer Electronics Show on January 7, 2014, Sony unveiled PlayStation Now , a digital distribution service which will initially allow users to access PlayStation 3 games on the PS4 via a cloud-based streaming system, purchasing games individually or via a subscription, as a solution of no backwards compatibility on the hardware of the console. [138] The United States Open Beta went live on July 31, 2014. [139] The official United States release of the service was on January 13, 2015. [140] As of March 2015 PlayStation Now was in closed beta in the United Kingdom. [141]\n\"It's abundantly clear that PS4 is being driven as a collaboration between East and West, as opposed to a dictation from one side to the other. Developers are fully involved, activated, discussed and doing really cool collaborative things.\"\nPre-release reception to the console from developers and journalists was positive. Mark Rein of Epic Games praised the \"enhanced\" architecture of Sony's system, describing it as \"a phenomenal piece of hardware\". [142] John Carmack , programmer and co-founder of id Software , also commended the design by saying \"Sony made wise engineering choices\", [143] while Randy Pitchford of Gearbox Software expressed satisfaction with the amount of high-speed memory in the console. [144] Eurogamer also called the graphics technology in the PS4 \"impressive\" and an improvement from the difficulties developers experienced on the PlayStation 3. [56]\nNumerous industry professionals have acknowledged the PlayStation 4's performance advantage over the Xbox One. Speaking to Edge magazine, multiple game developers have described the difference as \"significant\" and \"obvious\". [145] ExtremeTech says the PS4's graphics processing unit offers a \"serious advantage\" over the competition, but due to the nature of cross-platform development, games that share the same assets will appear \"very similar\". In other scenarios, designers may tap some of PS4's additional power in a straightforward manner, to boost frame rate or output at a higher resolution, whereas games from Sony's own first-party studios that take full advantage of the hardware \"will probably look significantly better than anything on the Xbox One.\" [146]\nIn response to concerns surrounding the possibility of DRM measures to hinder the resale of used games (and in particular, the initial DRM policies of Xbox One , which did contain such restrictions), Jack Tretton explicitly stated during Sony's E3 press conference that there would be \"no restrictions\" on the resale and trading of PS4 games on physical media, while software product development head Scott Rohde specified that Sony was planning to disallow online passes as well, going on to say that the policies were designed to be \"consumer-friendly, extremely retailer-friendly, and extremely publisher-friendly\". [147] [148] After Sony's E3 2013 press conference, IGN responded positively to Sony's attitude towards indie developers and trading games, stating they thought \"most gamers would agree\" that \"if you care about games like [Sony] do, you'll buy a PlayStation 4\". [149] PlayStation 4's removable and upgradable hard drive also drew praise from IGN, [150] with Scott Lowe commenting that the decision gave the console \"another advantage\" over the Xbox One, whose hard drive cannot be accessed. [151]\nGameSpot called the PlayStation 4 \"the gamer's choice for next-generation\", citing its price, lack of restrictive digital rights management , and most importantly, Sony's efforts to \"acknowledge its consumers\" and \"respect its audience\" as major factors. [152]\nThe PlayStation 4 has received very positive reviews by critics. Scott Lowe of IGN gave it an 8.2 rating out of 10 praising the console's DualShock 4 design and social integration features. He criticized the console's lack of software features and for underutilizing the DualShock 4's touch pad. [153] The Gadget Show gave a similar review complimenting the DualShock 4's new triggers and control sticks, in addition to the new Remote Play feature, yet criticized the system's lack of media support at launch. [154] IGN compared the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 over various categories, allowing their readers to vote for their preferred system. The PS4 won every category offered, and IGN awarded the PS4 with their People's Choice Award. [155]\nShortly following the launch, it became apparent that some games released on multiple platforms were available in higher resolutions on the PS4 as opposed to other video game consoles. Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku reported on the differences in early games such as Call of Duty: Ghosts and Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag which ran at 1080p on the PS4, but in 720p and 900p, respectively, on the Xbox One .

In August 2013, Sony announced the placement of over a million preorders for the console, [166] while on the North American launch alone, one million PlayStation 4 consoles were sold. [167] In the UK, the PlayStation 4 became the best-selling console at launch, with the sale of 250,000 consoles within a 48-hour period [168] and 530,000 in the first five weeks. [169]\nOn January 7, 2014, Andrew House announced in his Consumer Electronics Show keynote speech that 4.2 million PS4 units had been sold-through by the end of 2013, [170] with more than 9.7 million software units sold. [171] On February 18, 2014, Sony announced that, as of February 8, it had sold over 5.3 million console units following the release of the PS4 onto the North American and Western/Central European markets. [172] [173] Within the first two days of release in Japan during the weekend of February 22, 2014, 322,083 consoles were sold. [174] PS4 software unit sales surpassed 20.5 million on April 13, 2014. [175] During Japan's 2013 fiscal year , heightened demand for the PS4 helped Sony top global console sales, beating Nintendo for the first time in eight years. [176]\nAccording to data released by Nielsen in August 2014, nine months after the PS4 was released, thirty-one percent of its sales were to existing Wii and Xbox 360 owners, none of whom had by then owned a PS3. [177] At Gamescom 2014, it was announced that 10 million PS4 units had been sold-through to consumers worldwide, [178] and on November 13, it was announced that the PlayStation 4 was the top-selling console in the U.S. for the tenth consecutive month. [179]\nIn its first sales announcement of 2015, Sony confirmed on January 4 that it had sold-through 18.5 million PlayStation 4 units. [180] Sony updated the sell-through figures for the system throughout 2015: over 20 million consoles as of March 3, 2015, [181] over 30 million as of November 22, 2015, [182] and over 35 million by the end of 2015. [183] As of May 22, 2016, total worldwide sell-through reached 40 million. [184] As of December 2018, over 91 million consoles and more than 876 million PlayStation 4 games have been sold worldwide. By October 2019, the PS4 had sold 102.8 million times, making it the second best-selling home video game console of all time, behind the PlayStation 2 . [185]\nThe PlayStation 4 holds a market share of at least 70% within all European countries, as of June 2015.

Successive models have added or removed various features, and each model has variations of Limited Edition consoles.\nOn September 7, 2016, Sony announced a hardware revision of the PlayStation 4, model number CUH-2000, known colloquially as the PlayStation 4 Slim , which phased out the original model. [215] It is a revision of the original PS4 hardware with a smaller form factor; it has a rounded body with a matte finish on the top of the console rather than a two-tone finish, and is 40% smaller in size than the original model. The two USB ports on the front have been updated to the newer USB 3.1 standard and have a larger gap between them, and the optical audio port was removed. [216] This model also features support for USB 3.1, Bluetooth 4.0 and 5.0 GHz Wi-Fi. [217]\nIt was released on September 15, 2016, with a 500 GB model at the same price as the original version of the PlayStation 4. [41] On April 18, 2017, Sony announced that it had replaced this base model with a 1 TB version at the same MSRP. [218]\nThe PlayStation 4 Pro (codenamed Neo , model number CUH-7000) [38] was announced on September 7, 2016, and launched worldwide on November 10, 2016. [219] [220] It is an upgraded version of the PlayStation 4 with improved hardware to enable 4K rendering and improved PlayStation VR performance, including an upgraded GPU with 4.198 teraflops of processing power [221] and hardware support for checkerboard rendering , [222] and a higher CPU clock. As with PS4 \"Slim\", this model also features support for USB 3.1, Bluetooth 4.0 and 5.0 GHz Wi-Fi. [217] The PS4 Pro also includes 1 GB of DDR3 memory that is used to swap out non-gaming applications that run in the background, allowing games to utilize an additional 512 MB of the console's GDDR5 memory. [223] Although capable of streaming 4K video, the PS4 Pro does not support Ultra HD Blu-ray . [224] [225] [226]\nGames marketed by Sony as PS4 Pro Enhanced have specific optimizations when played on this model, such as 4K resolution graphics and/or higher performance. [227] For games not specifically optimized, an option known as \"Boost Mode\" was added on system software 4.5, which can be enabled to force higher CPU and GPU clock rates on existing games to possibly improve performance. [228]\nRendering games at 4K resolution is achieved through various rendering techniques and hardware features; PlayStation technical chief Mark Cerny explained that Sony could not \"brute force\" 4K without compromising form factor and cost, so the console was designed to support \"streamlined rendering techniques\" using custom hardware, \"best-in-breed temporal and spatial anti-aliasing algorithms\", and \"many new features from the AMD Polaris architecture as well as several even beyond it\". The most prominent technique used is checkerboard rendering, wherein the console only renders portions of a scene using a checkerboard pattern, and then uses algorithms to fill in the non-rendered segments. The checkerboarded screen can then be smoothed using an anti-aliasing filter. Hermen Hulst of Guerrilla Games explained that PS4 Pro could render something \"perceptively so close [to 4K] that you wouldn't be able to see the difference\". [229] [230] [231]\nPS4 Pro supports Remote Play, Share Play, and streaming at up to 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second, as well as capturing screenshots at 2160p, and 1080p video at 30 frames per second. [232]\nIn late 2017, Sony issued a new PS4 Pro revision (model number CUH-7100) that featured updated internal components. The actual hardware specifications and performance remained the same as the original model, although it was found that the revised console has a slightly quieter fan profile than the original and as a result was operating at a slightly higher temperature under load than the CUH-7000. In October 2018, Sony quietly issued another revision (model number CUH-7200), initially as part of Red Dead Redemption 2 hardware bundles. The revision has a different power supply which uses the same type of cord as the \"Slim\" model, and was shown to have further improvements to acoustics.

Announced as the successor to the PlayStation 3 in February 2013, it was launched on November 15, 2013, in North America, November 29, 2013 in Europe, South America and Australia, and on February 22, 2014 in Japan. A console of the eighth generation , it competes with Microsoft 's Xbox One and Nintendo 's Wii U and Switch . Moving away from the more complex Cell microarchitecture of its predecessor, the console features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) built upon the x86-64 architecture, which can theoretically peak at 1.84 teraflops ; AMD stated that it was the \"most powerful\" APU it had developed to date. The PlayStation 4 places an increased emphasis on social interaction and integration with other devices and services, including the ability to play games off-console on PlayStation Vita and other supported devices (\" Remote Play \"), the ability to stream gameplay online or to friends, with them controlling gameplay remotely (\"Share Play\"). The console's controller was also redesigned and improved over the PlayStation 3, with improved buttons and analog sticks, and an integrated touchpad among other changes. The console also supports HDR10 High-dynamic-range video and playback of 4K resolution multimedia. The PlayStation 4 was released to critical acclaim, with critics praising Sony for acknowledging its consumers' needs, embracing independent game development , and for not imposing the restrictive digital rights management schemes like those originally announced by Microsoft for the Xbox One. Critics and third-party studios, before its launch, also praised the capabilities of the PlayStation 4 in comparison to its competitors; developers described the performance difference between the console and Xbox One as \"significant\" and \"obvious\". Heightened demand also helped Sony top global console sales. By October 2019, PS4 became the second-best-selling home game console of all time, behind the PlayStation 2 . On September 7, 2016, Sony unveiled the PlayStation 4 Slim, a smaller version of the console; and a high-end version called the PlayStation 4 Pro, which features an upgraded GPU and a higher CPU clock rate to support enhanced performance and 4K resolution in supported games. Its successor, the PlayStation 5 , was released in November 2020, with Sony discontinuing in Japan all PlayStation 4 models except the Slim version in January 2021, with it still being produced in Western markets following their statement of 3-year support of PS4. According to lead architect Mark Cerny , the development of Sony's fourth video game console began as early as 2008. [9] [10] Less than two years earlier, the PlayStation 3 had been launched after months of delays due to issues with production. [11] The delay placed Sony almost a year behind Microsoft's Xbox 360 , which was already approaching unit sales of 10 million by the time the PS3 launched. [11] Sony Computer Entertainment Europe CEO Jim Ryan said Sony wanted to avoid repeating the same mistake with PS3's successor. [12] In designing the system, Sony worked with software developer Bungie , who offered their input on the controller and how to make it better for shooting games. [13] In 2012, Sony began shipping development kits to game developers, consisting of a modified PC running the AMD Accelerated Processing Unit chipset. [14] These development kits were known as \"Orbis\". [15] [16] In early 2013, Sony announced that an event known as PlayStation Meeting 2013 would be held in New York City , U.S., on February 20, 2013, to cover the \"future of PlayStation\". [17] [18] Sony officially announced the PlayStation 4 at the event. [19] [20] It revealed details about the console's hardware and discussed some of the new features it would introduce. [19] [21] Sony also showed off real-time footage of games in development, as well as some technical demonstrations. [22] [23] The design of the console was unveiled in June at E3 2013 , and the initial recommended retail prices of $399 (NA), \u20ac399 (Europe), and \u00a3349 (UK) given. [24] [25] Sony took advantage of problems that Microsoft had been having with their positioning of their newly announced Xbox One , which included its higher price point ($499 in North America), as well as strict regulations on how users could share game media. Besides its lower price point, Sony focused on the ease one would have in sharing media with the PS4. [26] The company revealed release dates for North America, Central America, South America, Europe, and Australia, as well as final pieces of information, at a Gamescom press event in Cologne , Germany, on August 20, 2013. The console was released on November 15, 2013, in the United States and Canada , followed by further releases on November 29, 2013. [2] By the end of 2013, the PS4 was launched in more European, Asian and South American countries. [27] [28] The PS4 was released in Japan at \u00a539,980 on February 22, 2014. [29] Sony finalized a deal with the Chinese government in May 2014 to sell its products in mainland China, and the PS4 will be the first product to be released. Kazuo Hirai , chief executive officer of Sony, said in May: \"The Chinese market, just given the size of it, is obviously potentially a very large market for video game products ... I think that we will be able to replicate the kind of success we have had with PS4 in other parts of the world in China .\" [30] In September 2015, Sony reduced the price of the PS4 in Japan to \u00a534,980, [31] with similar price drops in other Southeast Asian markets. [32] The first official sub-\u00a3300 PS4 bundle was the \u00a3299.99 \"Uncharted Nathan Drake Collection 500GB\", and was released in the UK on October 9, 2015; a 1 TB \u00a3329.99 version was offered at the same time. [33] On October 9, 2015, the first official price cut of the PS4 in North America was announced: a reduction of $50 to $349.99 (US) and by $20 to $429.99 (Canada). [34] [35] [36] An official price cut in Europe followed in late October 2015, reduced to \u20ac349.99/\u00a3299.99. [37] On June 10, 2016, Sony confirmed that a hardware revision of the PlayStation 4, rumored to be codenamed \"Neo\", was under development. The new revision is a higher-end model that is meant to support gameplay in 4K . The new model will be sold alongside the existing model, and all existing software will be compatible between the two models. [38] Layden stated that Sony has no plans to \"bifurcate the market\", only that gamers playing on the Neo will \"have the same experience, but one will be delivered at a higher resolution, with an enhanced graphical experience, but everything else is going to be exactly as you'd expect\". [39] The high-end console was publicly revealed on September 7, 2016, as PlayStation 4 Pro. [40] At the same time, Sony unveiled an updated version of the original PS4 model with a smaller form factor. [41] In May 2018, during a presentation to investors, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO John Kodera stated that the PlayStation 4 was heading into the end of its lifecycle and that the company was anticipating decreasing year-over-year hardware sales. [42] He explained that Sony would be countering the expected decline by focusing on \"strengthen[ing] user engagement\" including continued investments into new first-party games and other online services for PS4. \"We will use the next three years to prepare the next step, to crouch down so that we can jump higher in the future,\" Kodera added in an interview with the press the following day. [43] Following the launch of the PlayStation 5 in November 2020, Sony discontinued production in Japan of all but the 500GB Slim model of the PlayStation 4 on January 5, 2021, with the standard PS4 and PS4 Pro still being produced for western markets. [44] According to a report from Bloomberg News in January 2022, Sony had been poised to discontinue the PlayStation 4 at the end of 2021 in favor of the PlayStation 5, but due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage that made it difficult for Sony to keep up with PlayStation 5 demand, the company instead planned to continue PlayStation 4 production. Besides helping to offset the PlayStation 5 shortage, this production method would help assure deals with its component providers for the PlayStation 5. [45] The technology in the PlayStation 4 is similar to the hardware found in modern personal computers . [46] This familiarity is designed to make it easier and less expensive for game studios to develop games for the PS4. [47] [48] \"[We] have not built an APU quite like that for anyone else in the market. It is by far the most powerful APU we have built to date\". - John Taylor, AMD [49] The PlayStation 4 uses an Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) developed by AMD in cooperation with Sony. It combines a central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU), as well as other components such as a memory controller and video decoder . [50] The CPU consists of two 28 nm quad-core Jaguar modules totaling 8 64-bit x86-64 cores , [50] [51] 7 of which are available for game developers to use. [52] The GPU consists of 18 compute units to produce a theoretical peak performance of 1.84 TFLOPS . [23] The system's GDDR5 memory is capable of running at a maximum clock frequency of 2.75 GHz (5500 MT/s) and has a maximum memory bandwidth of 176 GB/s. [23] [53] [54] The console contains 8 GB of GDDR5 memory, [23] [55] 16 times the amount of RAM found in the PS3 and is expected to give the console considerable longevity. [46] [56] It also includes secondary custom chips that handle tasks associated with downloading, uploading, and social gameplay. [57] [58] These tasks can be handled seamlessly in the background during gameplay or while the system is in sleep mode . [59] The console also contains an audio module, which can support in-game chat as well as \"a very large number\" of audio streams for use in-game. [60] All PlayStation 4 models support high dynamic range (HDR) color profiles. [61] Its read-only optical drive is capable of reading Blu-ray Discs at speeds of up to three times that of its predecessor. [56] [62] The console features a hardware on-the-fly zlib decompression module. [60] The original PS4 model supports up to 1080p and 1080i video standards, [63] while the Pro model supports 4K resolution . [64] The console includes a 500 gigabyte hard drive for additional storage, [65] which can be upgraded by the user. [66] System Software 4.50, which was released on March 9, 2017, [67] enabled the use of external USB hard drives up to 8 TB for additional storage. [68] The PlayStation 4 features Wi-Fi and Ethernet connectivity, Bluetooth , and two USB 3.0 ports. [23] [56] An auxiliary port is also included for connection to the PlayStation Camera , a motion detection digital camera device first introduced on the PS3. [23] A mono headset, which can be plugged into the DualShock 4, is bundled with the system. [69] Audio/video output options include HDMI TV and optical S/PDIF audio. [23] The console does not have an analog audio/video output. [70] The PS4 features a \" Rest mode \" feature. This places the console in a low-power state while allowing users to immediately resume their game or app once the console is awoken. The console also is able to download content such as game and OS updates while it is in this state. [71] [72] The DualShock 4 is PlayStation 4's primary controller; it maintains a similar design to previous iterations of the DualShock series, but with additional features and design refinements. [73] Among other tweaks, the caps of the analog sticks were given a concave design (similar to the Xbox 360 controller ), the shape of the triggers and shoulder buttons was refined, the D-pad buttons were given a steeper downward angle to provide a resting space in the center for the user's thumb, [73] [74] and the hand grips were made thicker and given microtexturing to improve their feel. [73] [74] A major addition to the DualShock 4 is a touchpad ; it is capable of detecting up to two simultaneous touch presses, and can also be pressed down as a button. [73] The \"Start\" and \"Select\" buttons were replaced by \"Options\" and \"Share\" buttons; the latter is designed to allow access to the PlayStation 4's social features (including streaming, video recording, and screenshot tools). [73] [75] The DualShock 4 is powered by a non-removable, rechargeable lithium-ion battery, which can be charged using its micro USB connector. The controller also features an internal speaker, and a headphone jack for headsets or headphones; the console is bundled with a pair of headset earbuds . [76] [77] [73] The controller's motion tracking system is more sensitive than those of the PlayStation 3's controllers. An LED \"light bar\" was additionally added to the front of the controller; it is designed to allow the PlayStation Camera accessory to further track its motion, but can also be used to provide visual effects and feedback within games (such as, for instance, reflecting a player's low health by turning red). [78] [76] [75] [79] Although the PS4 and DualShock 4 continue to use Bluetooth for wireless connectivity, the console is incompatible with PlayStation 3 controllers. [80] An exception are the PlayStation Move motion controllers originally released for PS3, which are officially supported for use with the PlayStation Camera. [76] [81] In October 2013, Shuhei Yoshida stated on Twitter that the DualShock 4 would support \"basic functions\" when attached to a PC. [82] In August 2016, Sony unveiled an official USB wireless adapter for the DualShock 4, enabling use of all of the controller's functionality on PC. [83] In December 2016, Valve 's Steam platform was updated to provide support and controller customization functionality for DualShock 4, through existing APIs for the Steam Controller . [84] [85] A revision of the DualShock 4 was released alongside the \"Slim\" and Pro models in 2016, and is bundled with these systems. It is largely identical to the original model, except that the touchpad now contains a \"stripe\" along the top which the light bar's LED can shine through, and the controller can communicate non-wirelessly when connected to the console over USB. [86] Main article: PlayStation Camera The PlayStation Camera is an optional motion sensor and camera for the PlayStation 4, similar to Kinect on Xbox . It includes two 1280\u00d7800 pixel lenses operating with an aperture of f /2.0, with 30 cm focusing distance, and an 85\u00b0 field of view . [69] The dual camera setup allows for different modes of operation, depending on the initiated and running application. [87] The two cameras can be used together for depth-sensing of its surrounding objects in its field of vision. [88] Alternatively, one of the cameras can be used for generating the video image, with the other used for motion tracking. [89] PlayStation Camera also features a four-channel microphone array, which helps reduce unwanted background noise and can be used for voice commands. [87] With the PlayStation Camera connected, different users can automatically log-on to the system via face detection . [69] Main article: PlayStation VR PlayStation VR is a virtual reality system for PlayStation 4; it consists of a headset , which features a 1080p display panel, LED lights on the headset that are used by PlayStation Camera to track its motion, and a control box that processes 3D audio effects , as well as video output to the external display (either simulcasting the player's VR perspective, or providing an asymmetrical secondary perspective). PlayStation VR can also be used with PlayStation Move motion controllers. [90] [91] The PlayStation 4's operating system is called \"Orbis OS\", based upon a customized FreeBSD 9. [92] [93] [94] [95] The console does not require an Internet connection for usage, although more functionality is available when connected. [96] The PS4 is the first to include a WebKit -based web browser, which is a departure from its predecessor's NetFront browser; [ citation needed ] it is based on the same modern WebKit core as Google Chrome and Safari , giving it high compatibility in HTML5 compliance testing. [97] The console introduces a customizable menu interface, the \"PlayStation Dynamic Menu\", featuring a variety of color schemes. [72] The interface displays the player's profile, recent activity, notifications, and other details in addition to unlocked trophies . [98] It allows multiple user accounts, all with their own pass-codes. Each player account has the option to share their real name with friends, or use a nickname in other situations when anonymity is important. Facebook profiles can be connected to PlayStation Network accounts, making it easier to recognize friends. [99] The default home screen features real time content from friends. The \"What's New\" activity feed includes shared media, recently played games, and other notifications. [23] Services from third-party vendors, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video , can be accessed within the interface. [100] Multitasking is available during gameplay, such as opening the browser or managing party chat, and switching between applications is done by double-tapping the \"PS\" button. [23] The PlayStation Camera or a microphone enables the user to control the system using voice input . Players can command the interface to start a game, take screenshots, and save videos. Saying \"PlayStation\" initiates voice control, and \"All Commands\" displays a list of possible commands. [101] The PlayStation 4 supports Blu-ray and DVD playback, including 3D Blu-ray. The playing of CD is no longer supported, [102] as the console no longer has an infrared 780 nm laser. Custom music and video files can still be played from USB drives and DLNA servers using the Media Player app. [103] Main article: PlayStation Network The PlayStation 4 allows users to access a variety of free and premium PlayStation Network (PSN) services, including the PlayStation Store , PlayStation Plus subscription service, PlayStation Music powered by Spotify , and the PlayStation Video subscription service, which allows owners to rent or buy TV shows and films \u00e0 la carte . [23] A United States-exclusive cloud-based television-on-demand service known as PlayStation Vue began beta testing in late November 2014. [104] [105] Sony intends to expand and evolve the services it offers over the console's lifespan. [106] Unlike PS3, a PlayStation Plus membership is required to access multiplayer in most games; this requirement does not apply to free-to-play or subscription-based games. [107] Smartphones and tablets can interact with the PlayStation 4 as second screen devices, and can also wake the console from sleep mode. [108] A Sony Xperia smartphone, tablet or the PlayStation Vita can be used for streaming gameplay from the console to handheld, allowing supported games to be played remotely from around a household or away from home. [109] [110] Sony has ambitions to make all PS4 games playable on PlayStation Vita. [23] Developers can add Vita-specific controls for use via Remote Play. [111] This feature was later expanded to enable PS4 Remote Play functionality on Microsoft Windows PCs and on Apple OS X Macs. The update, released in April 2016, allows for Remote Play functionality on computers running Windows 8.1 , Windows 10 , OS X Yosemite , and OS X El Capitan . Remote Play supports resolution options of 360p, 540p, and 720p (1080p is available on PS4 Pro), frame rate options of 30\u201360 FPS, and the DualShock 4 can be connected via USB . [112] The PlayStation App allows iOS and Android mobile devices to interact with the PlayStation 4 from their device. The user can use this application to purchase PS4 games from the console and have them remotely downloaded, watch live streams of other gamers, and/or view in-game maps while playing games. [113] \"Ustream's integration within PS4 consoles will put gamers on a new media field. They will have the ability to direct, produce, and star in their own video game production, simply by being an awesome (or not so awesome!) gamer.\" Sony is focused on \"social\" aspects as a major feature of the console. Although the PS4 has improved social functionality, the features are optional and can be disabled. [106] Users have the option to create or join community groups based on personal interest. Communities include a discussion board, accomplishments and game clips shared by other members, plus the ability to join group chat and launch cooperative games. Sony stated that \"communities are a good way to socialize with like-minded players\", particularly when \"you want to tackle a big multiplayer raid, but don't have enough friends available.\" [115] Sony has officially stated that starting April 2021, the community system of the PlayStation Network will be discontinued. This, however, will not prevent users from communicating with their friends in private messaging or in group chats on the PlayStation Network. [116] The DualShock 4 controller includes a \"SHARE\" button, allowing the player to cycle through the last 60 minutes of recorded gameplay to select a screenshot or video clip appropriate for sharing. Media is uploaded seamlessly from the console to other PSN users or social networking sites such as Dailymotion , Facebook , Twitter and YouTube , or else users can copy media to a USB flash drive and upload to a social network or website of their preference. [117] Players can also use a free video editing application named ShareFactory to cut and assemble their favorite video clips and add custom music or voice commentary with green screen effects. Subsequent updates have added options for picture-in-picture layouts, the ability to create photo collages and animated GIFs . [118] [119] Gamers can either watch live gameplay of games which their friends are playing through the PS4 interface with cross-game camera and microphone input, spectate silently, or broadcast their own gameplay live via DailyMotion , Twitch , [120] Ustream , [23] Niconico , [121] or YouTube Gaming , [115] allowing for friends and members of the public to view and comment upon them from other web browsers and devices. If a user is not screen-casting, a friend can send them a \"Request to Watch\" notification. [115] \"SharePlay\" redirects here. For FaceTime feature, see FaceTime \u00a7 History . Share Play allows users to invite an online friend to join their play session via streaming, even if they do not own a copy of the game. Users can pass control of the game entirely to the remote user or partake in cooperative multiplayer as if they were physically present. Mark Cerny says that remote assistance is particularly useful when confronted by a potentially game-defeating obstacle. \"You can even see that your friend is in trouble and reach out through the network to take over the controller and assist them through some difficult portion of the game,\" he said. Share Play requires a PlayStation Plus subscription and can only be used for one hour at a time. [122] [123] PlayStation 4 games are distributed at retail on Blu-ray Disc , and digitally as downloads through the PlayStation Store . [124] Games are not region-locked, so games purchased in one region can be played on consoles in all regions, [125] and players can sign-on to any PS4 console to access their entire digital game library. [126] All PlayStation 4 games must be installed to the console's storage. [127] Additionally a system called \"PlayGo\" allows users to begin to play portions of a game (such as opening levels) once the installation or download reaches a specific point, while the remainder of the game is downloaded or installed in the background. Updates to games and system software are also downloaded in the background and while in standby. [60] PS4 users will, in the future, be able to browse games and stream games via Gaikai to demo them almost instantaneously. [23] [128] Sony says it is committed to releasing an ever-increasing number of free-to-play games, including PlanetSide 2 and War Thunder . [129] [130] Sony also took steps to make it easier for independent game developers to release games for the PS4 by giving them the option to self-publish their own games rather than rely upon others to distribute their games. [131] [132] PlayStation 4 is not compatible with any disc of older PlayStation consoles. [133] [134] Emulated versions of selected PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable games are available for purchase via PlayStation Store, which are upscaled to high definition and have support for PS4 social features. [133] [135] Main article: PlayStation Now In December 2013, Andrew House indicated that Sony was planning to launch a cloud gaming service for the PS4 in North America within the third quarter of 2014, with a European launch to follow in 2015. [136] [137] At Consumer Electronics Show on January 7, 2014, Sony unveiled PlayStation Now , a digital distribution service which will initially allow users to access PlayStation 3 games on the PS4 via a cloud-based streaming system, purchasing games individually or via a subscription, as a solution of no backwards compatibility on the hardware of the console. [138] The United States Open Beta went live on July 31, 2014. [139] The official United States release of the service was on January 13, 2015. [140] As of March 2015 PlayStation Now was in closed beta in the United Kingdom. [141] \"It's abundantly clear that PS4 is being driven as a collaboration between East and West, as opposed to a dictation from one side to the other. Developers are fully involved, activated, discussed and doing really cool collaborative things.\" Pre-release reception to the console from developers and journalists was positive. Mark Rein of Epic Games praised the \"enhanced\" architecture of Sony's system, describing it as \"a phenomenal piece of hardware\". [142] John Carmack , programmer and co-founder of id Software , also commended the design by saying \"Sony made wise engineering choices\", [143] while Randy Pitchford of Gearbox Software expressed satisfaction with the amount of high-speed memory in the console. [144] Eurogamer also called the graphics technology in the PS4 \"impressive\" and an improvement from the difficulties developers experienced on the PlayStation 3. [56] Numerous industry professionals have acknowledged the PlayStation 4's performance advantage over the Xbox One. Speaking to Edge magazine, multiple game developers have described the difference as \"significant\" and \"obvious\". [145] ExtremeTech says the PS4's graphics processing unit offers a \"serious advantage\" over the competition, but due to the nature of cross-platform development, games that share the same assets will appear \"very similar\". In other scenarios, designers may tap some of PS4's additional power in a straightforward manner, to boost frame rate or output at a higher resolution, whereas games from Sony's own first-party studios that take full advantage of the hardware \"will probably look significantly better than anything on the Xbox One.\" [146] In response to concerns surrounding the possibility of DRM measures to hinder the resale of used games (and in particular, the initial DRM policies of Xbox One , which did contain such restrictions), Jack Tretton explicitly stated during Sony's E3 press conference that there would be \"no restrictions\" on the resale and trading of PS4 games on physical media, while software product development head Scott Rohde specified that Sony was planning to disallow online passes as well, going on to say that the policies were designed to be \"consumer-friendly, extremely retailer-friendly, and extremely publisher-friendly\". [147] [148] After Sony's E3 2013 press conference, IGN responded positively to Sony's attitude towards indie developers and trading games, stating they thought \"most gamers would agree\" that \"if you care about games like [Sony] do, you'll buy a PlayStation 4\". [149] PlayStation 4's removable and upgradable hard drive also drew praise from IGN, [150] with Scott Lowe commenting that the decision gave the console \"another advantage\" over the Xbox One, whose hard drive cannot be accessed. [151] GameSpot called the PlayStation 4 \"the gamer's choice for next-generation\", citing its price, lack of restrictive digital rights management , and most importantly, Sony's efforts to \"acknowledge its consumers\" and \"respect its audience\" as major factors. [152] The PlayStation 4 has received very positive reviews by critics. Scott Lowe of IGN gave it an 8.2 rating out of 10 praising the console's DualShock 4 design and social integration features. He criticized the console's lack of software features and for underutilizing the DualShock 4's touch pad. [153] The Gadget Show gave a similar review complimenting the DualShock 4's new triggers and control sticks, in addition to the new Remote Play feature, yet criticized the system's lack of media support at launch. [154] IGN compared the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 over various categories, allowing their readers to vote for their preferred system. The PS4 won every category offered, and IGN awarded the PS4 with their People's Choice Award. [155] Shortly following the launch, it became apparent that some games released on multiple platforms were available in higher resolutions on the PS4 as opposed to other video game consoles. Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku reported on the differences in early games such as Call of Duty: Ghosts and Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag which ran at 1080p on the PS4, but in 720p and 900p, respectively, on the Xbox One .

In August 2013, Sony announced the placement of over a million preorders for the console, [166] while on the North American launch alone, one million PlayStation 4 consoles were sold. [167] In the UK, the PlayStation 4 became the best-selling console at launch, with the sale of 250,000 consoles within a 48-hour period [168] and 530,000 in the first five weeks. [169] On January 7, 2014, Andrew House announced in his Consumer Electronics Show keynote speech that 4.2 million PS4 units had been sold-through by the end of 2013, [170] with more than 9.7 million software units sold. [171] On February 18, 2014, Sony announced that, as of February 8, it had sold over 5.3 million console units following the release of the PS4 onto the North American and Western/Central European markets. [172] [173] Within the first two days of release in Japan during the weekend of February 22, 2014, 322,083 consoles were sold. [174] PS4 software unit sales surpassed 20.5 million on April 13, 2014. [175] During Japan's 2013 fiscal year , heightened demand for the PS4 helped Sony top global console sales, beating Nintendo for the first time in eight years. [176] According to data released by Nielsen in August 2014, nine months after the PS4 was released, thirty-one percent of its sales were to existing Wii and Xbox 360 owners, none of whom had by then owned a PS3. [177] At Gamescom 2014, it was announced that 10 million PS4 units had been sold-through to consumers worldwide, [178] and on November 13, it was announced that the PlayStation 4 was the top-selling console in the U.S. for the tenth consecutive month. [179] In its first sales announcement of 2015, Sony confirmed on January 4 that it had sold-through 18.5 million PlayStation 4 units. [180] Sony updated the sell-through figures for the system throughout 2015: over 20 million consoles as of March 3, 2015, [181] over 30 million as of November 22, 2015, [182] and over 35 million by the end of 2015. [183] As of May 22, 2016, total worldwide sell-through reached 40 million. [184] As of December 2018, over 91 million consoles and more than 876 million PlayStation 4 games have been sold worldwide. By October 2019, the PS4 had sold 102.8 million times, making it the second best-selling home video game console of all time, behind the PlayStation 2 . [185] The PlayStation 4 holds a market share of at least 70% within all European countries, as of June 2015.

(as of March, 2021) The PlayStation 4 has been produced in various models: the original, the Slim, and the Pro. Successive models have added or removed various features, and each model has variations of Limited Edition consoles. On September 7, 2016, Sony announced a hardware revision of the PlayStation 4, model number CUH-2000, known colloquially as the PlayStation 4 Slim , which phased out the original model. [215] It is a revision of the original PS4 hardware with a smaller form factor; it has a rounded body with a matte finish on the top of the console rather than a two-tone finish, and is 40% smaller in size than the original model. The two USB ports on the front have been updated to the newer USB 3.1 standard and have a larger gap between them, and the optical audio port was removed. [216] This model also features support for USB 3.1, Bluetooth 4.0 and 5.0 GHz Wi-Fi. [217] It was released on September 15, 2016, with a 500 GB model at the same price as the original version of the PlayStation 4. [41] On April 18, 2017, Sony announced that it had replaced this base model with a 1 TB version at the same MSRP. [218] The PlayStation 4 Pro (codenamed Neo , model number CUH-7000) [38] was announced on September 7, 2016, and launched worldwide on November 10, 2016. [219] [220] It is an upgraded version of the PlayStation 4 with improved hardware to enable 4K rendering and improved PlayStation VR performance, including an upgraded GPU with 4.198 teraflops of processing power [221] and hardware support for checkerboard rendering , [222] and a higher CPU clock. As with PS4 \"Slim\", this model also features support for USB 3.1, Bluetooth 4.0 and 5.0 GHz Wi-Fi. [217] The PS4 Pro also includes 1 GB of DDR3 memory that is used to swap out non-gaming applications that run in the background, allowing games to utilize an additional 512 MB of the console's GDDR5 memory. [223] Although capable of streaming 4K video, the PS4 Pro does not support Ultra HD Blu-ray . [224] [225] [226] Games marketed by Sony as PS4 Pro Enhanced have specific optimizations when played on this model, such as 4K resolution graphics and/or higher performance. [227] For games not specifically optimized, an option known as \"Boost Mode\" was added on system software 4.5, which can be enabled to force higher CPU and GPU clock rates on existing games to possibly improve performance. [228] Rendering games at 4K resolution is achieved through various rendering techniques and hardware features; PlayStation technical chief Mark Cerny explained that Sony could not \"brute force\" 4K without compromising form factor and cost, so the console was designed to support \"streamlined rendering techniques\" using custom hardware, \"best-in-breed temporal and spatial anti-aliasing algorithms\", and \"many new features from the AMD Polaris architecture as well as several even beyond it\". The most prominent technique used is checkerboard rendering, wherein the console only renders portions of a scene using a checkerboard pattern, and then uses algorithms to fill in the non-rendered segments. The checkerboarded screen can then be smoothed using an anti-aliasing filter. Hermen Hulst of Guerrilla Games explained that PS4 Pro could render something \"perceptively so close [to 4K] that you wouldn't be able to see the difference\". [229] [230] [231] PS4 Pro supports Remote Play, Share Play, and streaming at up to 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second, as well as capturing screenshots at 2160p, and 1080p video at 30 frames per second. [232] In late 2017, Sony issued a new PS4 Pro revision (model number CUH-7100) that featured updated internal components. The actual hardware specifications and performance remained the same as the original model, although it was found that the revised console has a slightly quieter fan profile than the original and as a result was operating at a slightly higher temperature under load than the CUH-7000. In October 2018, Sony quietly issued another revision (model number CUH-7200), initially as part of Red Dead Redemption 2 hardware bundles. The revision has a different power supply which uses the same type of cord as the \"Slim\" model, and was shown to have further improvements to acoustics.

It features the final regular appearance of Peter Capaldi as the Twelfth Doctor , the first official appearance of Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor , and guest-stars David Bradley as the First Doctor , having previously portrayed original First Doctor actor William Hartnell in the 2013 docudrama An Adventure in Space and Time . Pearl Mackie guest stars as the Twelfth Doctor's former companion Bill Potts , while his other companions make guest appearances \u2013 Jenna Coleman as Clara Oswald and Matt Lucas as Nardole .\nThis episode is a continuation of events after \" The Doctor Falls \", addressing the cliffhanger that it ended on, and takes place during the final serial of the First Doctor, The Tenth Planet (1966), which ended with the introduction of the concept of a Doctor regenerating; footage from The Tenth Planet is used in the special. \"Twice Upon a Time\" is Capaldi's fourth and final Christmas special as the Twelfth Doctor, and the last Doctor Who story to be written and produced by Moffat, who had served as the show's executive producer and chief writer since taking over from Russell T Davies in 2010. After the special's broadcast, Moffat was succeeded as executive producer and showrunner by Chris Chibnall . It is also the last episode to have music composed by Murray Gold , who had composed music since the series' revival in 2005 and was succeeded by Segun Akinola in Series 11 . The special has received generally positive reviews from critics.\nWandering back to his TARDIS through the South Pole in 1986 after leaving his companions behind, the First Doctor refuses to regenerate . He encounters the Twelfth Doctor outside his own TARDIS in a similar state of mind. The pair are soon approached by a confused and injured First World War British captain ( Mark Gatiss ), displaced from December 1914 while in a gun-point stalemate with a German soldier. All three are then forcibly taken into a large spaceship. Inside, they meet with Bill Potts . The Twelfth Doctor, however, doubts she is the real Bill. Upon encountering the ship's glass-like holographic pilot, they are offered freedom in exchange for allowing the ship to return the Captain to the moment of his death. Refusing to allow the Captain to die, they escape and take the First Doctor's TARDIS to the planet Villengard in the far future.\nAlone, the Twelfth Doctor meets with the rogue Dalek Rusty , who has taken refuge from other Daleks hunting it. Given access to the Dalek Hivemind, the Doctor learns that the pilot and its ship, known as Testimony , were created on New Earth, designed to extract people from their timelines at the moment of their death, and archive their memories into glass avatars. \"Bill\" is one such avatar, created from her memories. Seeing no evil to fight, the Doctors agree to return the Captain to his timeline. Upon arrival, the Captain asks the Doctors to keep an eye on his family, introducing himself as Archibald Hamish Lethbridge-Stewart (implying that he is the ancestor of the Doctor's frequent ally and lifelong friend, the Brigadier , and his daughter Kate Stewart ). As time resumes, the Doctors watch as soldiers on both sides begin singing \" Silent Night \". The Twelfth Doctor explains to the First that he deliberately shifted the Captain's timeline forward to the start of the Christmas truce , to ensure his life would be spared.\nWith the Captain saved, the First Doctor informs the Twelfth that he is now prepared to regenerate and says his goodbyes before returning to his TARDIS. He returns to the South Pole for Ben and Polly and finally regenerates into his second incarnation . Now alone with Bill's avatar, the Twelfth Doctor adamantly contends she is not really Bill, but she argues that memories are what defines a person. Bill's avatar restores the Doctor's memories of Clara Oswald before they are joined by Nardole 's avatar. The Doctor, however, refuses to give the avatars testimony of his life. They respect his wish to be alone and leave after he embraces them both. The Doctor then returns to the TARDIS and decides to regenerate, but not before relaying some personal advice to his next incarnation.\nAfter the newly regenerated Thirteenth Doctor examines her own reflection, she is shocked and excited to discover that her new incarnation is a woman. However, the instant she presses a button on the console, the TARDIS suffers multiple system failures due to damage caused by the delayed regeneration. Falling out of the tumbling ship, the Doctor watches in horror as the time rotor and the console room explode, and the TARDIS dematerialises while she plummets towards the Earth below.\n\"Twice Upon a Time\" takes place towards the end of the First Doctor's final serial, The Tenth Planet (first broadcast in October 1966), some of which is shown at the start of the special. During the last episode's final moments, the Doctor leaves his companions Ben and Polly and returns to the TARDIS; they find him collapsed in the console room, where he undergoes his first regeneration. Derek Martinus , the episode's director, reportedly cut a line from the original script which suggested that the Doctor was refusing to give in to the regeneration process. Steven Moffat's 2017 story creates an extended narrative around that part of the story, in which the First Doctor delays his regeneration and encounters his future self \u2014 the Twelfth Doctor \u2014 in the snowy wasteland. [1] [2]\nWhen Testimony shows the First Doctor images of his future incarnations, clips from both the classic series and the revival are used, including the Third Doctor from Invasion of the Dinosaurs (1974); the Fifth Doctor from Arc of Infinity (1983); the Seventh Doctor from The Happiness Patrol (1988); the Eighth Doctor from \" The Night of the Doctor \" (2013); the Ninth Doctor from \" The Parting of the Ways \" (2005); and the Tenth Doctor from \" The Waters of Mars \" (2009). [3]\nTestimony also lists several of the Doctor's future titles: \"The Shadow of the Valeyard \" (from The Trial of a Time Lord , said to be a distillation of the Doctor's darker side), \"the Oncoming Storm\" (\"The Parting of the Ways\"), \"the Imp of the Pandorica\" (a reference to the Eleventh Doctor story \" The Pandorica Opens \"), \"the Beast of Trenzalore\" (\" The Time of the Doctor \"), \"the Butcher of Skull Moon\" and \"the Doctor of War\" (\" Hell Bent \"). \"The Destroyer of Skaro\" refers to the destruction of the planet in Remembrance of the Daleks (1988), although Skaro was later restored, as explained in \" Asylum of the Daleks \" (2012) and shown in \" The Magician's Apprentice \" (2015). [3]\nThe Weapons Factories of Villengard were originally mentioned in \" The Doctor Dances \" ( Steven Moffat 's first Doctor Who story), where the Ninth Doctor implied that he was responsible for their destruction. [4] [5]\nHelen Clay, who would become Testimony's glass pilot, was from New Earth and lectured at \"New Earth University,\" a reference to the Tenth Doctor stories \" New Earth \" and \" Gridlock \". [3]\nThe Doctor addresses his original incarnation as \" Mary Berry \", \" Corporal Jones \", and \"Mr Pastry\". [3] Mr Pastry was a comedic variety stage act and children's show character played by actor Richard Hearne , [6] who was once considered for the role of the Fourth Doctor . Hearne, however, wanted to play the Doctor as a version of Mr. Pastry, so he was passed over in favour of Tom Baker . [3]\nThe Doctor paraphrases philosopher Bertrand Russell when he advises his future self that \"hate is always foolish and love is always wise\". [7]\nPeter Capaldi reprised his role as the Twelfth Doctor . On 30 January 2017, he confirmed that the tenth series would be his last, and that he was set to leave after the 2017 Christmas special. [8] The episode also sees the introduction of Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor , whose casting was announced on 16 July 2017. [9] [10]\nDavid Bradley appears in the episode as the First Doctor, having previously portrayed William Hartnell in the docudrama An Adventure in Space and Time . [11] [12] [13] This makes him the third actor to play the role in the television programme, after William Hartnell and Richard Hurndall (in 1983's The Five Doctors ) since the premiere of Doctor Who in 1963. [14] Bradley previously played Solomon in the 2012 episode \" Dinosaurs on a Spaceship \". Since 2017, Bradley has reprised his role as the First Doctor in many audio dramas for Big Finish Productions alongside his co-stars from An Adventure in Space and Time .\nThe first trailer for the episode was shown during the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con , revealing the return of Polly , a companion from the end of William Hartnell 's tenure as the First Doctor , portrayed by Lily Travers , [15] and Pearl Mackie as Bill Potts . Also confirmed were appearances by Toby Whithouse , writer of seven episodes between 2006 and 2017, [16] and Mark Gatiss , also writer of nine episodes between 2005 and 2017, marking his fourth acting appearance in the series, playing a character credited as The Captain. [17] [18] In an interview following the episode's broadcast, Gatiss said he cried at the thought of playing the Brigadier's grandfather when he finished reading the script. [19] However, the Haisman Literary Estate asserted their control of the backstory of the Brigadier, stating that Archibald was actually the Brigadier's great-uncle who appeared in Night of the Intelligence . [20] [21] They later compromised in What's Past is Prologue by implying that Archibald may secretly be the biological father of the Brigadier's father, thereby allowing for either interpretation. [22] [23]\nIt was later confirmed that Ben Jackson, a companion of the First and Second Doctors , who served alongside Polly, would also feature in the episode and that he would be played by the former Hollyoaks cast member Jared Garfield . [24] Hartnell, Anneke Wills and Michael Craze appeared as the First Doctor, Polly and Ben respectively through archive footage, [25] as also did Patrick Troughton as the freshly regenerated Second Doctor . Nikki Amuka-Bird voices the \"Glass Woman\". [26]\nAs with the last change of showrunners, Chibnall wrote the final moments of the episode, so as to allow him to write Whittaker's first lines on the show. This happened in the 2010 special \" The End of Time \", when Moffat took over for Russell T. Davies in the final moments of the episode, writing Matt Smith 's first words as the Eleventh Doctor . [27]\nThe episode includes a cameo appearance by Jenna Coleman as Clara Oswald , as the Doctor's memories of Clara, lost during \" Hell Bent \", are restored. The scene was the last to be filmed for the episode and while Coleman was willing to come back to film, timing between the filming of this special and her work in Victoria was difficult to arrange. Moffat said \"How many times have I killed that girl off and she was right there in my last shot! It's absolutely extraordinary. The unkillable Coleman!\" [28]\nThe episode was written by Steven Moffat and directed by Rachel Talalay , [29] who wrote and directed the two-part finale of the tenth series , \" World Enough and Time \" / \" The Doctor Falls \", respectively. [30] [31] In January 2016, Moffat announced that he would step down as the programme's showrunner after the tenth series, to be replaced by Chris Chibnall beginning with the eleventh series in 2018, but a 2017 Christmas special was not mentioned in the plans at that time. [32] The change in showrunners almost caused the annual episode to be cancelled, as Moffat planned to leave after the tenth series finale and Chibnall did not want to begin his run with a Christmas special. When he learned of Chibnall's plans, Moffat elected to stay long enough to produce one final episode, as he was concerned that the show would lose the coveted 25 December slot in the future if it missed a year. As a result, he had to rewrite his plans for the tenth series finale to allow Capaldi to appear in one more episode. [33]\nNear the end of the special, the two Doctors part company and return to their respective TARDISes to undergo regeneration. The First Doctor's regeneration is shown, using original footage from \"The Tenth Planet\". Although the last episode of the 1966 story is one of the missing episodes of Doctor Who , the regeneration sequence was preserved when it was used in a 1973 edition of the children's magazine programme Blue Peter . [1] [34]\nThe final scene of \" The Doctor Falls \" involving David Bradley was filmed as part of the filming of \"Twice Upon a Time\" in June 2017. [35] Production for \"Twice Upon a Time\" started on 12 June 2017, and concluded on 10 July 2017. [36] [37] [38] However, the final scene of the episode, in which Whittaker makes her debut as the Doctor, was not filmed until 19 July. [39] The episode had been reportedly titled \"The Doctors\", before it was announced at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con that it would officially be titled \"Twice Upon a Time\". [40] [18]\nThe episode was watched by 5.70 million viewers overnight, making it the fifth most watched programme of the day across all channels. [41] The episode received 7.92 million views overall, and it received an Appreciation Index of 81. [42] [43] In the United States \"Twice Upon a Time\" was watched by 2.2 million viewers on BBC America . [44]\n\"Twice Upon a Time\" was released in cinemas in multiple countries, including Brazil on 25 December, Australia and Denmark on 26 December, and the United States and Canada on 27\u201328 December.

It features the final regular appearance of Peter Capaldi as the Twelfth Doctor , the first official appearance of Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor , and guest-stars David Bradley as the First Doctor , having previously portrayed original First Doctor actor William Hartnell in the 2013 docudrama An Adventure in Space and Time . Pearl Mackie guest stars as the Twelfth Doctor's former companion Bill Potts , while his other companions make guest appearances \u2013 Jenna Coleman as Clara Oswald and Matt Lucas as Nardole . This episode is a continuation of events after \" The Doctor Falls \", addressing the cliffhanger that it ended on, and takes place during the final serial of the First Doctor, The Tenth Planet (1966), which ended with the introduction of the concept of a Doctor regenerating; footage from The Tenth Planet is used in the special. \"Twice Upon a Time\" is Capaldi's fourth and final Christmas special as the Twelfth Doctor, and the last Doctor Who story to be written and produced by Moffat, who had served as the show's executive producer and chief writer since taking over from Russell T Davies in 2010. After the special's broadcast, Moffat was succeeded as executive producer and showrunner by Chris Chibnall . It is also the last episode to have music composed by Murray Gold , who had composed music since the series' revival in 2005 and was succeeded by Segun Akinola in Series 11 . The special has received generally positive reviews from critics. Wandering back to his TARDIS through the South Pole in 1986 after leaving his companions behind, the First Doctor refuses to regenerate . He encounters the Twelfth Doctor outside his own TARDIS in a similar state of mind. The pair are soon approached by a confused and injured First World War British captain ( Mark Gatiss ), displaced from December 1914 while in a gun-point stalemate with a German soldier. All three are then forcibly taken into a large spaceship. Inside, they meet with Bill Potts . The Twelfth Doctor, however, doubts she is the real Bill. Upon encountering the ship's glass-like holographic pilot, they are offered freedom in exchange for allowing the ship to return the Captain to the moment of his death. Refusing to allow the Captain to die, they escape and take the First Doctor's TARDIS to the planet Villengard in the far future. Alone, the Twelfth Doctor meets with the rogue Dalek Rusty , who has taken refuge from other Daleks hunting it. Given access to the Dalek Hivemind, the Doctor learns that the pilot and its ship, known as Testimony , were created on New Earth, designed to extract people from their timelines at the moment of their death, and archive their memories into glass avatars. \"Bill\" is one such avatar, created from her memories. Seeing no evil to fight, the Doctors agree to return the Captain to his timeline. Upon arrival, the Captain asks the Doctors to keep an eye on his family, introducing himself as Archibald Hamish Lethbridge-Stewart (implying that he is the ancestor of the Doctor's frequent ally and lifelong friend, the Brigadier , and his daughter Kate Stewart ). As time resumes, the Doctors watch as soldiers on both sides begin singing \" Silent Night \". The Twelfth Doctor explains to the First that he deliberately shifted the Captain's timeline forward to the start of the Christmas truce , to ensure his life would be spared. With the Captain saved, the First Doctor informs the Twelfth that he is now prepared to regenerate and says his goodbyes before returning to his TARDIS. He returns to the South Pole for Ben and Polly and finally regenerates into his second incarnation . Now alone with Bill's avatar, the Twelfth Doctor adamantly contends she is not really Bill, but she argues that memories are what defines a person. Bill's avatar restores the Doctor's memories of Clara Oswald before they are joined by Nardole 's avatar. The Doctor, however, refuses to give the avatars testimony of his life. They respect his wish to be alone and leave after he embraces them both. The Doctor then returns to the TARDIS and decides to regenerate, but not before relaying some personal advice to his next incarnation. After the newly regenerated Thirteenth Doctor examines her own reflection, she is shocked and excited to discover that her new incarnation is a woman. However, the instant she presses a button on the console, the TARDIS suffers multiple system failures due to damage caused by the delayed regeneration. Falling out of the tumbling ship, the Doctor watches in horror as the time rotor and the console room explode, and the TARDIS dematerialises while she plummets towards the Earth below. \"Twice Upon a Time\" takes place towards the end of the First Doctor's final serial, The Tenth Planet (first broadcast in October 1966), some of which is shown at the start of the special. During the last episode's final moments, the Doctor leaves his companions Ben and Polly and returns to the TARDIS; they find him collapsed in the console room, where he undergoes his first regeneration. Derek Martinus , the episode's director, reportedly cut a line from the original script which suggested that the Doctor was refusing to give in to the regeneration process. Steven Moffat's 2017 story creates an extended narrative around that part of the story, in which the First Doctor delays his regeneration and encounters his future self \u2014 the Twelfth Doctor \u2014 in the snowy wasteland. [1] [2] When Testimony shows the First Doctor images of his future incarnations, clips from both the classic series and the revival are used, including the Third Doctor from Invasion of the Dinosaurs (1974); the Fifth Doctor from Arc of Infinity (1983); the Seventh Doctor from The Happiness Patrol (1988); the Eighth Doctor from \" The Night of the Doctor \" (2013); the Ninth Doctor from \" The Parting of the Ways \" (2005); and the Tenth Doctor from \" The Waters of Mars \" (2009). [3] Testimony also lists several of the Doctor's future titles: \"The Shadow of the Valeyard \" (from The Trial of a Time Lord , said to be a distillation of the Doctor's darker side), \"the Oncoming Storm\" (\"The Parting of the Ways\"), \"the Imp of the Pandorica\" (a reference to the Eleventh Doctor story \" The Pandorica Opens \"), \"the Beast of Trenzalore\" (\" The Time of the Doctor \"), \"the Butcher of Skull Moon\" and \"the Doctor of War\" (\" Hell Bent \"). \"The Destroyer of Skaro\" refers to the destruction of the planet in Remembrance of the Daleks (1988), although Skaro was later restored, as explained in \" Asylum of the Daleks \" (2012) and shown in \" The Magician's Apprentice \" (2015). [3] The Weapons Factories of Villengard were originally mentioned in \" The Doctor Dances \" ( Steven Moffat 's first Doctor Who story), where the Ninth Doctor implied that he was responsible for their destruction. [4] [5] Helen Clay, who would become Testimony's glass pilot, was from New Earth and lectured at \"New Earth University,\" a reference to the Tenth Doctor stories \" New Earth \" and \" Gridlock \". [3] The Doctor addresses his original incarnation as \" Mary Berry \", \" Corporal Jones \", and \"Mr Pastry\". [3] Mr Pastry was a comedic variety stage act and children's show character played by actor Richard Hearne , [6] who was once considered for the role of the Fourth Doctor . Hearne, however, wanted to play the Doctor as a version of Mr. Pastry, so he was passed over in favour of Tom Baker . [3] The Doctor paraphrases philosopher Bertrand Russell when he advises his future self that \"hate is always foolish and love is always wise\". [7] Peter Capaldi reprised his role as the Twelfth Doctor . On 30 January 2017, he confirmed that the tenth series would be his last, and that he was set to leave after the 2017 Christmas special. [8] The episode also sees the introduction of Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor , whose casting was announced on 16 July 2017. [9] [10] David Bradley appears in the episode as the First Doctor, having previously portrayed William Hartnell in the docudrama An Adventure in Space and Time . [11] [12] [13] This makes him the third actor to play the role in the television programme, after William Hartnell and Richard Hurndall (in 1983's The Five Doctors ) since the premiere of Doctor Who in 1963. [14] Bradley previously played Solomon in the 2012 episode \" Dinosaurs on a Spaceship \". Since 2017, Bradley has reprised his role as the First Doctor in many audio dramas for Big Finish Productions alongside his co-stars from An Adventure in Space and Time . The first trailer for the episode was shown during the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con , revealing the return of Polly , a companion from the end of William Hartnell 's tenure as the First Doctor , portrayed by Lily Travers , [15] and Pearl Mackie as Bill Potts . Also confirmed were appearances by Toby Whithouse , writer of seven episodes between 2006 and 2017, [16] and Mark Gatiss , also writer of nine episodes between 2005 and 2017, marking his fourth acting appearance in the series, playing a character credited as The Captain. [17] [18] In an interview following the episode's broadcast, Gatiss said he cried at the thought of playing the Brigadier's grandfather when he finished reading the script. [19] However, the Haisman Literary Estate asserted their control of the backstory of the Brigadier, stating that Archibald was actually the Brigadier's great-uncle who appeared in Night of the Intelligence . [20] [21] They later compromised in What's Past is Prologue by implying that Archibald may secretly be the biological father of the Brigadier's father, thereby allowing for either interpretation. [22] [23] It was later confirmed that Ben Jackson, a companion of the First and Second Doctors , who served alongside Polly, would also feature in the episode and that he would be played by the former Hollyoaks cast member Jared Garfield . [24] Hartnell, Anneke Wills and Michael Craze appeared as the First Doctor, Polly and Ben respectively through archive footage, [25] as also did Patrick Troughton as the freshly regenerated Second Doctor . Nikki Amuka-Bird voices the \"Glass Woman\". [26] As with the last change of showrunners, Chibnall wrote the final moments of the episode, so as to allow him to write Whittaker's first lines on the show. This happened in the 2010 special \" The End of Time \", when Moffat took over for Russell T. Davies in the final moments of the episode, writing Matt Smith 's first words as the Eleventh Doctor . [27] The episode includes a cameo appearance by Jenna Coleman as Clara Oswald , as the Doctor's memories of Clara, lost during \" Hell Bent \", are restored. The scene was the last to be filmed for the episode and while Coleman was willing to come back to film, timing between the filming of this special and her work in Victoria was difficult to arrange. Moffat said \"How many times have I killed that girl off and she was right there in my last shot! It's absolutely extraordinary. The unkillable Coleman!\" [28] The episode was written by Steven Moffat and directed by Rachel Talalay , [29] who wrote and directed the two-part finale of the tenth series , \" World Enough and Time \" / \" The Doctor Falls \", respectively. [30] [31] In January 2016, Moffat announced that he would step down as the programme's showrunner after the tenth series, to be replaced by Chris Chibnall beginning with the eleventh series in 2018, but a 2017 Christmas special was not mentioned in the plans at that time. [32] The change in showrunners almost caused the annual episode to be cancelled, as Moffat planned to leave after the tenth series finale and Chibnall did not want to begin his run with a Christmas special. When he learned of Chibnall's plans, Moffat elected to stay long enough to produce one final episode, as he was concerned that the show would lose the coveted 25 December slot in the future if it missed a year. As a result, he had to rewrite his plans for the tenth series finale to allow Capaldi to appear in one more episode. [33] Near the end of the special, the two Doctors part company and return to their respective TARDISes to undergo regeneration. The First Doctor's regeneration is shown, using original footage from \"The Tenth Planet\". Although the last episode of the 1966 story is one of the missing episodes of Doctor Who , the regeneration sequence was preserved when it was used in a 1973 edition of the children's magazine programme Blue Peter . [1] [34] The final scene of \" The Doctor Falls \" involving David Bradley was filmed as part of the filming of \"Twice Upon a Time\" in June 2017. [35] Production for \"Twice Upon a Time\" started on 12 June 2017, and concluded on 10 July 2017. [36] [37] [38] However, the final scene of the episode, in which Whittaker makes her debut as the Doctor, was not filmed until 19 July. [39] The episode had been reportedly titled \"The Doctors\", before it was announced at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con that it would officially be titled \"Twice Upon a Time\". [40] [18] The episode was watched by 5.70 million viewers overnight, making it the fifth most watched programme of the day across all channels. [41] The episode received 7.92 million views overall, and it received an Appreciation Index of 81. [42] [43] In the United States \"Twice Upon a Time\" was watched by 2.2 million viewers on BBC America . [44] \"Twice Upon a Time\" was released in cinemas in multiple countries, including Brazil on 25 December, Australia and Denmark on 26 December, and the United States and Canada on 27\u201328 December. The cinema release includes two bonus features: a behind-the-scenes view of the episode, and a special celebrating the tenure of Peter Capaldi as the Doctor and Steven Moffat as showrunner and lead writer.

Instead, on 20 August, it passed safely to the south, between Orkney and Fair Isle , and was carried into the Atlantic at about 59 1 \u2044 2 'N. From there it was due to sail from North Uist in the Hebrides Islands until it caught sight of the distant islet of Rockall , but failed again.", "Southerly winds blew from 21 August to 3 September,

September 1588 of a large portion of the 130-strong fleet sent by Philip II to invade England .\nFollowing its defeat at the naval battle of Gravelines the Armada had attempted to return home through the North Atlantic , when it was driven from its course by violent storms, toward the west coast of Ireland. The prospect of a Spanish landing alarmed the Dublin government of Queen Elizabeth I , which prescribed harsh measures for the Spanish invaders and any Irish who might assist them.\nUp to 24 ships of the Armada were wrecked on a rocky coastline spanning 500 km, from Antrim in the north to Kerry in the south, and the threat to Crown authority was readily defeated. Many of the survivors of the multiple wrecks were put to death, and the remainder fled across the sea to Scotland. It is estimated that some 6,000 members of the fleet perished in Ireland or off its coasts.\nMain article: Spanish Armada\nThe Spanish Armada was a fleet of 130 ships that sailed from A Coru\u00f1a in August 1588 under the command of the Duke of Medina Sidonia with the purpose of escorting an army from Flanders to invade England . It met with armed resistance in the English Channel , when a fireship attack off Calais broke its formation, and was driven into the North Sea after the Battle of Gravelines .\nWhen the fleet entered the North Sea, 110 ships remained under Medina Sidonia's command. Many were damaged by gunfire or were running low on supplies, making them unfit for service in the Atlantic Ocean. Some had cut their anchors in the flight from the fireships, which severely diminished their ability to navigate close to shore. Also, the Armada commanders made a large navigational error that brought the fleet too close to the dangerous Atlantic coasts of Scotland and Ireland.\nAfter Gravelines the commanders of the Armada held a conference on Sidonia's flagship. Some proposed a course for Norway, others for Ireland. The admiral made his choice, and orders were issued to the fleet:\nThe course that is first to be held is to the north/north-east until you be found under 61 degrees and a half; and then to take great heed lest you fall upon the Island of Ireland for fear of the harm that may happen unto you upon that coast. Then, parting from those islands and doubling the Cape in 61 degrees and a half, you shall run west/south-west until you be found under 58 degrees ; and from thence to the south-west to the height of 53 degrees ; and then to the south/south-west, making to the Cape Finisterre , and so to procure your entrance into The Groyne A Coru\u00f1a or to Ferrol , or to any other port of coast of Galicia . [1]\nThe fleet was to approach the coast of Norway, before steering to the meridian of the Shetland Islands and on to Rockall . This allowed passage outside the northern tip of Shetland, clearing the coast of Scotland at a distance of 160 km. Once out in the broad Atlantic, the ships were to steer to a point 645 km beyond the Shannon estuary on the west coast of Ireland, giving themselves a clear run to northern Spain. [2]\nThe Armada's sailing orders were almost impossible to follow. The weather was difficult. Many of the ships and their crew members were in great distress. The navigators' charts were primitive, [3] and their best training and experience in the techniques of dead reckoning and latitude sailing fell far short of what was needed to bring the fleet safely home. [4]\nThe Armada failed to keep its course around the north of Shetland at 61 1 \u2044 2 'N. Instead, on 20 August, it passed safely to the south, between Orkney and Fair Isle , and was carried into the Atlantic at about 59 1 \u2044 2 'N. From there it was due to sail from North Uist in the Hebrides Islands until it caught sight of the distant islet of Rockall , but failed again. Southerly winds blew from 21 August to 3 September, stirred up by an anticyclone over Scandinavia, which prevented the fleet from running west-south-west as ordered. One report reflects the frustration of the navigators: \"We sailed without knowing whither through constant fogs, storms and squalls\". [5]\nThe sailing orders were rendered useless by the weather, but the miscalculation of the Armada's position contributed greatly to its destruction. The navigators were unaware of the effect of the eastward flowing Gulf Stream , which must have hindered the fleet's progress \u2013 perhaps by as much as 30 km a day. The paymaster of the San Juan Bautista , Marcos de Aramburu, recorded a log of his progress from late August onwards, when the rest of the fleet was within sight. The inference from his observations is that his ship's estimated position as it turned for home was entirely wrong, some 480 km to the west: its real position lay in the east, perilously close to the coasts of Scotland and Ireland. This single deficiency \"made the difference between safety and disaster\". [6]\nAfter seven weeks at sea the opportunity to make landfall and take on supplies and effect repairs must have been welcome, but navigation in these waters demanded intimate knowledge. The experience of Spanish mariners in the intricacies of north Atlantic conditions was largely confined to trading voyages to the south and south-west of Ireland, and it is likely that the fleet's pilots preferred to maintain Sidonia's course, despite the hardships on board their ships.\nMost of the fleet \u2013 84 ships \u2013 avoided land, and most of those made it home, although in varying degrees of distress. The remainder were forced toward the coast of Ireland \u2013 perhaps 28 \u2013 and included several galleons and many merchantmen. The latter had been converted for battle and were leaking heavily, making sail with severely damaged masts and rigging, and with most of their anchors missing. The ships seem to have maintained contact until the beginning of September, when they were scattered by a south-west gale (described in the contemporary account of an Irish government official as one \"the like whereof hath not been seen or heard for a long time\"). Within days, this lost fleet had made landfall in Ireland.\nThe head of the English Crown administration at Dublin was Lord Deputy William Fitzwilliam . In August 1588 he was presented with credible intelligence that the battle in the English Channel had been won by the Spanish and that the invasion of England was set to be completed. Then it was understood that the Spanish were in the Atlantic and the entire fleet was about to fall on the coast of Ireland. The degree of alarm among the English at Dublin was extreme, and Fitzwilliam put out false reports that reinforcements from England were due to arrive with 10,000 troops.\nThe English feared the Spanish would land in disciplined formations, with the Irish rising out to join them from territories that were almost beyond the control of the government. But reliable intelligence was soon received at Waterford and Dublin that the ships were fetching up in a chaotic manner at disparate locations in the provinces of Ulster , Connacht and Munster , along a coastline spanning 300 miles (480 km). Fitzwilliam ordered that all Spaniards be captured and hanged summarily; and that anyone aiding them be tortured and charged as a traitor to the Crown.\nThe Armada first made landfall in the southern province of Munster, which had been colonised by the English in 1583 following the suppression of the last of the Desmond Rebellions . Fitzwilliam received orders from London to lead an expedition there, and intelligence from the governor of Connacht, Richard Bingham , soon confirmed that further landfalls were being made throughout the west and north of the country.\nThomond: Many ships were sighted off the coast of County Clare : four at Loop Head , two of which were wrecked, including San Esteban (700 tons, 264 men) at Doonbeg, and probably the heavily damaged San Marcos (790 tons, squadron of Portugal, 409 men, 33 guns) at Lurga Point (modern day Seafield, Quilty, County Clare ) inside Mutton Island. All survivors were put to death by the sheriff of Clare, Boetius MacClancy (some, according to tradition, at Gallows Hill, but more likely at Cnoc na Crocaire, Spanish Point).\nSeven ships anchored at Scattery Roads , probably with a pilot who knew the coast. Their landing party was fought off, but they did secure some supplies and managed to repair their ships. One galleon, Anunciada (703 tons, 24 guns, 275 men), was fired and scuttled off Kilrush on 12 September, [7] and the crew transferred to Barco de Danzig , which made it safely to Spain after the squadron departed the Shannon estuary on 11 September.\nBlasket Islands: One Armada commander, Juan Mart\u00ednez de Recalde , did have experience of the Irish coast: in 1580 he had landed a Papal invasion force in the Dingle peninsula , in the run up to the Siege of Smerwick , and had managed to evade an English squadron of warships. In the Armada he had command of the galleon San Juan de Portugal (1,150 tons, 500 men, 50 guns) of the Biscayan squadron, which engaged with the English fleet in the Channel and held off Francis Drake in Revenge , John Hawkins in Victory , and Martin Frobisher in Triumph .\nAfter the defeat at Gravelines Recalde's galleon led San Juan de Bautista (750 tons, 243 men) and another small vessel (almost certainly a Scottish fishing smack seized to assist with navigation and inshore work). As these ships approached the coast of Kerry , Recalde's lookouts sighted Mount Brandon on the Dingle peninsula and, to the west, the lofty Blasket Islands , a complex archipelago studded with reefs.\nRecalde steered to the islands in search of shelter, riding on a swell through a tight gap at the eastern tip of the Great Blasket Island . His galleon made it through to calm water and dropped anchor over a sandy bottom beneath sheer cliffs. San Juan de Bautista and the smack soon followed. The anchorage ensured that the only wind that might drive the ships off would bring them clear to the open sea. It was a difficult manoeuvre, demanding prior knowledge of the coastline.\nRecalde's ships remained within their shelter for several days, and a crown force led by Thomas Norris (brother of the soldier, John Norris ) and Edward Denny (husband of Lady Denny) arrived in Dingle to guard against a landing. Recalde sent a reconnaissance party ashore, but all eight members were captured. At one stage a westerly gale caused Portugal to collide with San Juan de Bautista , and when the wind died down another ship, Santa Maria de la Rosa (900 tons, 297 men: Guipuzcoa squadron), entered the sound from the north and fired off a gun by way of distress signal.\nAs the tide ebbed , Recalde's ships held their anchorage in the more sheltered part of the sound, while Santa Maria de la Rosa drifted and then simply sank \u2014 perhaps on striking Stromboli Rock \u2014 leaving one survivor for the English to interrogate. The survivor's information was that the captain of Santa Maria de la Rosa had called the pilot a traitor and run him through with a sword just as the ship began to sink; he also asserted that the Prince of Ascoli, son of the king of Spain, had gone down with the ship \u2014 this information was false, but proved useful propaganda for the English.\nTwo more ships entered the sound \u2014 San Juan de Ragusa (650 tons , 285 men), the other unidentified. San Juan de Ragusa was in distress and sank \u2014 perhaps on striking Dunbinna reef. San Juan de Bautista attempted to take advantage of an ebb tide and sail south out of the sound, but ended up tacking about on the flood tide to avoid the numerous reefs, before sailing through the north-west passage. After a difficult night, the crew were dismayed to find themselves at the mouth of the sound once more. But the wind blew from the south-east, and San Juan de Bautista finally escaped on 25 September and made it home to Spain through a terrible storm.\nThree days later Recalde led the remaining ships out of the sound and brought them to Spain, where he instantly died. [ citation needed ] Those survivors who had fallen into Denny's custody were put to death at Dingle.\nFenit : The sloop Nuestra Senora del Socorro (75 tons) anchored at Fenit , in Tralee Bay on the coast of Kerry, where she was surrendered to crown officers. The 24 men on board were taken into custody and marched to Tralee Castle . On the orders of Lady Margaret Denny , they were all hanged from a gibbet.\nValentia Island: Trinidad (800 tons, 302 men) was wrecked on the coast of Desmond \u2014 probably at Valentia Island , off the coast of south Kerry \u2014 although there are no details of this event.\nAt Liscannor the oar-powered galleass Zu\u00f1iga (290, Naples) anchored off-shore with a broken rudder, having found a gap in the Cliffs of Moher , which rise sheer from the sea over 220 metres. The ship came under surveillance by the sheriff of Clare and, when a cock-boat was sent ashore in search of supplies, the Spanish were attacked by crown forces and had to withdraw to their ship. One captive was taken and sent for interrogation.

[17]", "source_raw_text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia The Spanish Armada in Ireland refers to the landfall made upon the coast of Ireland in September 1588 of a large portion of the 130-strong fleet sent by Philip II to invade England . Following its defeat at the naval battle of Gravelines the Armada had attempted to return home through the North Atlantic , when it was driven from its course by violent storms, toward the west coast of Ireland. The prospect of a Spanish landing alarmed the Dublin government of Queen Elizabeth I , which prescribed harsh measures for the Spanish invaders and any Irish who might assist them. Up to 24 ships of the Armada were wrecked on a rocky coastline spanning 500 km, from Antrim in the north to Kerry in the south, and the threat to Crown authority was readily defeated. Many of the survivors of the multiple wrecks were put to death, and the remainder fled across the sea to Scotland. It is estimated that some 6,000 members of the fleet perished in Ireland or off its coasts. Main article: Spanish Armada The Spanish Armada was a fleet of 130 ships that sailed from A Coru\u00f1a in August 1588 under the command of the Duke of Medina Sidonia with the purpose of escorting an army from Flanders to invade England . It met with armed resistance in the English Channel , when a fireship attack off Calais broke its formation, and was driven into the North Sea after the Battle of Gravelines . When the fleet entered the North Sea, 110 ships remained under Medina Sidonia's command. Many were damaged by gunfire or were running low on supplies, making them unfit for service in the Atlantic Ocean. Some had cut their anchors in the flight from the fireships, which severely diminished their ability to navigate close to shore. Also, the Armada commanders made a large navigational error that brought the fleet too close to the dangerous Atlantic coasts of Scotland and Ireland. After Gravelines the commanders of the Armada held a conference on Sidonia's flagship. Some proposed a course for Norway, others for Ireland. The admiral made his choice, and orders were issued to the fleet: The course that is first to be held is to the north/north-east until you be found under 61 degrees and a half; and then to take great heed lest you fall upon the Island of Ireland for fear of the harm that may happen unto you upon that coast. Then, parting from those islands and doubling the Cape in 61 degrees and a half, you shall run west/south-west until you be found under 58 degrees ; and from thence to the south-west to the height of 53 degrees ; and then to the south/south-west, making to the Cape Finisterre , and so to procure your entrance into The Groyne A Coru\u00f1a or to Ferrol , or to any other port of coast of Galicia . [1] The fleet was to approach the coast of Norway, before steering to the meridian of the Shetland Islands and on to Rockall . This allowed passage outside the northern tip of Shetland, clearing the coast of Scotland at a distance of 160 km. Once out in the broad Atlantic, the ships were to steer to a point 645 km beyond the Shannon estuary on the west coast of Ireland, giving themselves a clear run to northern Spain. [2] The Armada's sailing orders were almost impossible to follow. The weather was difficult. Many of the ships and their crew members were in great distress. The navigators' charts were primitive, [3] and their best training and experience in the techniques of dead reckoning and latitude sailing fell far short of what was needed to bring the fleet safely home. [4] The Armada failed to keep its course around the north of Shetland at 61 1 \u2044 2 'N. Instead, on 20 August, it passed safely to the south, between Orkney and Fair Isle , and was carried into the Atlantic at about 59 1 \u2044 2 'N. From there it was due to sail from North Uist in the Hebrides Islands until it caught sight of the distant islet of Rockall , but failed again. Southerly winds blew from 21 August to 3 September, stirred up by an anticyclone over Scandinavia, which prevented the fleet from running west-south-west as ordered. One report reflects the frustration of the navigators: \"We sailed without knowing whither through constant fogs, storms and squalls\". [5] The sailing orders were rendered useless by the weather, but the miscalculation of the Armada's position contributed greatly to its destruction. The navigators were unaware of the effect of the eastward flowing Gulf Stream , which must have hindered the fleet's progress \u2013 perhaps by as much as 30 km a day. The paymaster of the San Juan Bautista , Marcos de Aramburu, recorded a log of his progress from late August onwards, when the rest of the fleet was within sight. The inference from his observations is that his ship's estimated position as it turned for home was entirely wrong, some 480 km to the west: its real position lay in the east, perilously close to the coasts of Scotland and Ireland. This single deficiency \"made the difference between safety and disaster\". [6] After seven weeks at sea the opportunity to make landfall and take on supplies and effect repairs must have been welcome, but navigation in these waters demanded intimate knowledge. The experience of Spanish mariners in the intricacies of north Atlantic conditions was largely confined to trading voyages to the south and south-west of Ireland, and it is likely that the fleet's pilots preferred to maintain Sidonia's course, despite the hardships on board their ships. Most of the fleet \u2013 84 ships \u2013 avoided land, and most of those made it home, although in varying degrees of distress. The remainder were forced toward the coast of Ireland \u2013 perhaps 28 \u2013 and included several galleons and many merchantmen. The latter had been converted for battle and were leaking heavily, making sail with severely damaged masts and rigging, and with most of their anchors missing. The ships seem to have maintained contact until the beginning of September, when they were scattered by a south-west gale (described in the contemporary account of an Irish government official as one \"the like whereof hath not been seen or heard for a long time\"). Within days, this lost fleet had made landfall in Ireland. The head of the English Crown administration at Dublin was Lord Deputy William Fitzwilliam . In August 1588 he was presented with credible intelligence that the battle in the English Channel had been won by the Spanish and that the invasion of England was set to be completed. Then it was understood that the Spanish were in the Atlantic and the entire fleet was about to fall on the coast of Ireland. The degree of alarm among the English at Dublin was extreme, and Fitzwilliam put out false reports that reinforcements from England were due to arrive with 10,000 troops. The English feared the Spanish would land in disciplined formations, with the Irish rising out to join them from territories that were almost beyond the control of the government. But reliable intelligence was soon received at Waterford and Dublin that the ships were fetching up in a chaotic manner at disparate locations in the provinces of Ulster , Connacht and Munster , along a coastline spanning 300 miles (480 km). Fitzwilliam ordered that all Spaniards be captured and hanged summarily; and that anyone aiding them be tortured and charged as a traitor to the Crown. The Armada first made landfall in the southern province of Munster, which had been colonised by the English in 1583 following the suppression of the last of the Desmond Rebellions . Fitzwilliam received orders from London to lead an expedition there, and intelligence from the governor of Connacht, Richard Bingham , soon confirmed that further landfalls were being made throughout the west and north of the country. Thomond: Many ships were sighted off the coast of County Clare : four at Loop Head , two of which were wrecked, including San Esteban (700 tons, 264 men) at Doonbeg, and probably the heavily damaged San Marcos (790 tons, squadron of Portugal, 409 men, 33 guns) at Lurga Point (modern day Seafield, Quilty, County Clare ) inside Mutton Island. All survivors were put to death by the sheriff of Clare, Boetius MacClancy (some, according to tradition, at Gallows Hill, but more likely at Cnoc na Crocaire, Spanish Point). Seven ships anchored at Scattery Roads , probably with a pilot who knew the coast. Their landing party was fought off, but they did secure some supplies and managed to repair their ships. One galleon, Anunciada (703 tons, 24 guns, 275 men), was fired and scuttled off Kilrush on 12 September, [7] and the crew transferred to Barco de Danzig , which made it safely to Spain after the squadron departed the Shannon estuary on 11 September. Blasket Islands: One Armada commander, Juan Mart\u00ednez de Recalde , did have experience of the Irish coast: in 1580 he had landed a Papal invasion force in the Dingle peninsula , in the run up to the Siege of Smerwick , and had managed to evade an English squadron of warships. In the Armada he had command of the galleon San Juan de Portugal (1,150 tons, 500 men, 50 guns) of the Biscayan squadron, which engaged with the English fleet in the Channel and held off Francis Drake in Revenge , John Hawkins in Victory , and Martin Frobisher in Triumph . After the defeat at Gravelines Recalde's galleon led San Juan de Bautista (750 tons, 243 men) and another small vessel (almost certainly a Scottish fishing smack seized to assist with navigation and inshore work). As these ships approached the coast of Kerry , Recalde's lookouts sighted Mount Brandon on the Dingle peninsula and, to the west, the lofty Blasket Islands , a complex archipelago studded with reefs. Recalde steered to the islands in search of shelter, riding on a swell through a tight gap at the eastern tip of the Great Blasket Island . His galleon made it through to calm water and dropped anchor over a sandy bottom beneath sheer cliffs. San Juan de Bautista and the smack soon followed. The anchorage ensured that the only wind that might drive the ships off would bring them clear to the open sea. It was a difficult manoeuvre, demanding prior knowledge of the coastline. Recalde's ships remained within their shelter for several days, and a crown force led by Thomas Norris (brother of the soldier, John Norris ) and Edward Denny (husband of Lady Denny) arrived in Dingle to guard against a landing. Recalde sent a reconnaissance party ashore, but all eight members were captured. At one stage a westerly gale caused Portugal to collide with San Juan de Bautista , and when the wind died down another ship, Santa Maria de la Rosa (900 tons, 297 men: Guipuzcoa squadron), entered the sound from the north and fired off a gun by way of distress signal. As the tide ebbed , Recalde's ships held their anchorage in the more sheltered part of the sound, while Santa Maria de la Rosa drifted and then simply sank \u2014 perhaps on striking Stromboli Rock \u2014 leaving one survivor for the English to interrogate. The survivor's information was that the captain of Santa Maria de la Rosa had called the pilot a traitor and run him through with a sword just as the ship began to sink; he also asserted that the Prince of Ascoli, son of the king of Spain, had gone down with the ship \u2014 this information was false, but proved useful propaganda for the English. Two more ships entered the sound \u2014 San Juan de Ragusa (650 tons , 285 men), the other unidentified. San Juan de Ragusa was in distress and sank \u2014 perhaps on striking Dunbinna reef. San Juan de Bautista attempted to take advantage of an ebb tide and sail south out of the sound, but ended up tacking about on the flood tide to avoid the numerous reefs, before sailing through the north-west passage. After a difficult night, the crew were dismayed to find themselves at the mouth of the sound once more. But the wind blew from the south-east, and San Juan de Bautista finally escaped on 25 September and made it home to Spain through a terrible storm. Three days later Recalde led the remaining ships out of the sound and brought them to Spain, where he instantly died. [ citation needed ] Those survivors who had fallen into Denny's custody were put to death at Dingle. Fenit : The sloop Nuestra Senora del Socorro (75 tons) anchored at Fenit , in Tralee Bay on the coast of Kerry, where she was surrendered to crown officers. The 24 men on board were taken into custody and marched to Tralee Castle . On the orders of Lady Margaret Denny , they were all hanged from a gibbet. Valentia Island: Trinidad (800 tons, 302 men) was wrecked on the coast of Desmond \u2014 probably at Valentia Island , off the coast of south Kerry \u2014 although there are no details of this event. At Liscannor the oar-powered galleass Zu\u00f1iga (290, Naples) anchored off-shore with a broken rudder, having found a gap in the Cliffs of Moher , which rise sheer from the sea over 220 metres. The ship came under surveillance by the sheriff of Clare and, when a cock-boat was sent ashore in search of supplies, the Spanish were attacked by crown forces and had to withdraw to their ship. One captive was taken and sent for interrogation. Zu\u00f1iga escaped the coast with favourable winds, put in at Le Havre , and finally made it back to Naples the following year. Donegal: La Trinidad Valencera (1,000 tons, Levant squadron, 360 men, 42 guns) had taken on more water than could be pumped out. Yet as she approached the coast she managed to rescue 264 men from the Barca de Amburgo , another ship swamped in the heavy seas. Trinidad anchored in Glenagivney Bay , where she listed to such a degree that the order was given to abandon ship. Some locals were paid for the use of a small boat, and over the course of two days all 560 men were ferried to shore. [8] During a seven-day march inland, the column of survivors met a force of cavalry under the command of Richard Hovenden and Henry Hovenden [9] foster-brothers of Hugh O'Neill, 3rd Earl of Tyrone .

The final published novel of Anthony Burgess , Byrne: A Novel , features a protagonist who is specifically stated to be descended from Spanish survivors who remained in Ireland. The Luck of the Irish and Darby O'Gill and the Little People are American films that make reference to the wrecking of the Spanish armada as an explanation for leprechauns having pots of gold. The Spanish-Portuguese co-produced short animated film The Monkey (2021), influenced by the story of The Hartlepool Monkey , focuses on the treatment of the Spanish shipwrecked on Irish shores. The film, which stars Colm Meaney won the Goya , for best Best Animated Short Film in 2021 .

Some locals were paid for the use of a small boat, and over the course of two days more than 560 men were ferried safely to shore.\nAfter a seven-day march inland, the survivors met a force of English cavalry. Upon pledges of safe conduct for their delivery into the custody of the Crown, the Spanish laid down their arms near Ellagh Castle. The noblemen and officers were then separated out, but 300 of the common seamen learned a harsh lesson about trusting the word of English officials and were summarily executed between Ellagh and Culmore fort. Roughly 150 Spaniards broke free and fled through a bog, ending up either with Sorley Boy MacDonnell at Dunluce or at the house of the bishop of Derry.

The 45 Spanish noblemen and officers were force-marched more than 200km to Dublin, but only 30 survived to reach the capital. From there, they were dispatched to London to await ransom from Spain.\nThe Spanish plan and why it failed\nThe reason why Spaniards were shipwrecked in Ireland can be explained by the political events occurring on the continent of Europe. By spring 1588, King Philip II of Spain had grown weary of Queen Elizabeth I\u2019s interference in the civil unrest in the Spanish Netherlands. He decided that an invasion of England was the surest way to resolve the issue. Accordingly, he assembled a fleet of 130 ships, with 20,000 men and 2,500 cannons.

Fitzwilliam initially feared that the Spanish would land in disciplined formations, with many Irish rising to join them from territories that were essentially beyond the control of the government. Eventually, reliable intelligence was received that the ships were instead landing in a chaotic manner along hundreds of kilometres at disparate locations on the coasts of Ulster, Connacht and Munster. Fitzwilliam feared that the Spanish were landing in a distributed manner over a large area to try and ferment a nationwide Irish rebellion, so he ordered that all Spaniards captured be hanged summarily. He also stipulated that anyone aiding them would be tortured and charged as a traitor to the Crown. Impossible sailing orders The Spanish admiral\u2019s sailing orders were almost impossible to follow. The weather was difficult. The navigators\u2019 charts were primitive and focused on the English Channel, and thus were of little use. Moreover, most of the ships\u2019 navigators lacked training and experience in the techniques of dead-reckoning and latitude sailing, which was what was needed to return them safely to Spain. The Armada failed to sail its course around the north of Shetland. Instead, it passed to the south, between Orkney and Fair Isle. From there it was supposed to voyage around the Hebrides until it caught sight of the distant islet of Rockall, but prevailing southerly winds stirred up an anticyclone, preventing the fleet from running west-south-west as ordered. The sailing orders were rendered useless by the weather, but miscalculations of the Armada\u2019s position also contributed greatly to its destruction. The navigators were unaware of the effect of the North Atlantic Drift, a current that flows in a north-easterly direction. It surely hindered the fleet\u2019s westward progress, perhaps by as much as 30km a day. This meant that when the ships\u2019 navigators estimated how far they had sailed west each day, they overestimated by at least 25km. It is probable that the Armada\u2019s actual position as it turned south to head for home was entirely wrong, by almost 500km. The Armada thought that it was well to the west of Ireland but its actual position was further east, perilously close to the rocky coasts of Scotland and Ireland. Many Spanish ships were sighted off the coast of County Clare, including four at Loop Head, two of which were wrecked, the 700-ton San Esteban at Doonbeg (26) and the 800-ton San Marcos at Lurga Point near Seafield, Quilty (25). All of the several hundred survivors were put to death by the sheriff of Clare, as per Fitzwilliam\u2019s orders. The executions most likely took place at Cnoc na Crocaire, Spanish Point. Juan Mart\u00ednez de Recalde One Armada commander, Juan Mart\u00ednez de Recalde, did have prior experience of the Irish coast. In 1580 he had landed a papal invasion force on the Dingle peninsula, leading to the siege of Smerwick and the massacre of the 600-strong force; Recalde managed to evade an English squadron of warships afterwards and return home. After the Armada\u2019s defeat, Recalde\u2019s galleon led another ship, the San Juan de Bautista , to the coast of Kerry. Recalde\u2019s lookouts saw Mount Brandon on the Dingle peninsula and, towards the west, the Blasket Islands. Recalde steered to the islands in search of shelter, sailing through a tight gap at the eastern tip of the Great Blasket Island. His galleon made it through to calm water and anchored. The San Juan soon followed. It had been an exceedingly difficult sailing manoeuvre, requiring prior knowledge of the coastline and Blasket sound. Recalde\u2019s ships remained within their shelter for several days, and a Crown force arrived in Dingle to guard against a landing. Recalde sent a reconnaissance party ashore, but all eight were captured. Another ship, the 900-ton Santa Maria de la Rosa , appeared in the sound and fired off a gun by way of a distress signal. Recalde\u2019s ships held their anchorage in the more sheltered part of the sound, while the Santa Maria drifted and then sank, perhaps upon striking Stromboli Rock (30), leaving one survivor for the English to interrogate. The survivor claimed that the captain of the vessel had called the ship\u2019s pilot a traitor and run him through with a rapier just as the ship began to sink. He also asserted that the son of the king of Spain had gone down with the ship. That information was false but proved to be useful propaganda for the English. Two more ships entered the sound, the San Juan de Ragusa and an unidentified vessel. The de Ragusa was in distress and sank, perhaps upon striking Dunbinna reef (32). A third ship, the San Juan de Bautista , used an ebb tide to sail south out of the sound and finally escaped, making it home to Spain after a terrible storm. After three days Recalde led the remaining ships out of the sound and brought them to Spain. Those survivors who had fallen into Crown custody were put to death at Dingle. Another ship, the Trinidad, was wrecked off Valentia Island (33). There were no survivors of the 300-man crew and no witnesses to the wreck. La Girona \u2014greatest loss of life Among those ships wrecked in Connacht was the La Rata Santa Maria Encoronada , carrying over 400 men. She had run for the Irish coast in desperate need of repair, along with several other vessels. La Rata carried an extraordinarily large number of noblemen from the most ancient families of Spain, as well as the son of the Irish rebel James Fitzmaurice Fitzgerald. La Rata sailed along the north coast of Mayo and around the Belmullet peninsula, anchoring in Blacksod Bay. The wind rose and the ship dragged her anchors, until she was grounded on Ballycroy strand (18). Most of the crew got ashore and seized two castles, garrisoning them with stores from the beached ship, which was then burned. The rebel\u2019s son, Maurice Fitzmaurice, had died on board, and his body was buried at sea in a cypress chest. Several days later, two ships of the Armada entered Blacksod Bay, the Duquesa Santa Ana and another. The several hundred stranded Spaniards boarded the Duquesa. The other ship promptly sailed for Spain, safely arriving sometime later. The Duquesa , however, was somewhat weather-damaged and it was decided to sail north for Scotland. Turbulent weather hit and she was grounded in Loughros Bay, Co. Donegal (9), with all aboard reaching shore in what was friendly territory. The crew made camp on the shore for nine days, until news came that another ship, La Girona , had anchored in Killybegs harbour. MacSweeney Bannagh, the local Irish chieftain, aided the Spanish; the Girona was repaired and set sail with 1,300 men on board, including the survivors from the Duquesa and two other ships that sank in Killybegs harbour. Unfortunately, another gale struck and her rudder failed again. La Girona was driven ashore at Dunluce, Co. Antrim, off Lacada Point (1). There were only nine survivors, who were sent on to Scotland by Sorley Boy MacDonnell. Over the next few days, 260 Spanish bodies washed ashore. This was the greatest loss of life from a single ship. Final toll All told, approximately 33 ships of the Grand Armada were lost on the Irish coast, accounting for more than half of the fleet\u2019s total loss of 63 vessels (nearly half the Armada\u2019s total of 130). Thousands of Spanish sailors (including an estimated 2,000 who were Irish) were either drowned or executed as per orders of the Crown. The first salvage attempts were made within months, on the coast of County Clare by George Carew, who complained about the expense \u2018of sustaining the divers with copious draughts of usequebaugh\u2019. Sorley Boy MacDonnell recovered three brass cannon and two chests of treasure from the wreck of La Girona . In 1797 a quantity of lead and some brass guns were raised from the wreck of an unknown Armada ship at Mullaghderg, Co. Donegal (7). Also in Donegal, in 1853, an anchor was recovered from another unidentified Armada wreck at Cloughglass near MacSweeney\u2019s castle (8). And in the summer of 2014 an initiative to locate the remains of the San Marcos commenced operations between Mattle Island and the Curragh Shoal, Co. Clare (25). This initiative, called the San Marcos Project , assembled a group of academics, scientists and divers to employ cutting-edge search and survey techniques. John Miles is a US Marine Corps Lt. Col.

charged with escorting the Spanish Army of Flanders to England\u2019s shores.", "\nThe \u2018Armada\u2019 itself refers to the Spanish fleet assembled for the operation, which was intended to escort the Spanish Army of Flanders across the English channel, past the English fleet.", "Although Ireland had featured in previous drafts of Spanish invasion plans, it did not form a part of Spanish strategy in 1588.", "\nNevertheless, Ireland was, in the end, central to the defeat of the Armada.", "The Spanish fleet was blown north and west around the western Irish coast.", "As many as 27 ships and perhaps up to 9,000 Spanish soldiers and sailors lost their lives off the Atlantic coast of Ireland, either through drowning or were killed by English troops or Irish chieftains after they were washed ashore.", "\nAt the same time some Irish who were sympathetic to the Spaniards sheltered them and some kept them on as soldiers.", "\nSpain was the leading power in Europe and arguably the world.", "Phillip II of the house of Habsburg inherited European possessions including not only the Spanish kingdoms of Castille and Aragon, but also the Kingdom of Naples in southern Italy, the Italian islands of Sardinia and Sicily, several principalities in northern Italy and what was then known as the Spanish Netherlands.", "\nIn 1580-81 when the King of Portugal died without an heir, Phillip managed to make himself head of that kingdom too, together with its Atlantic fleet and overseas possessions.", "\nSpain was the superpower of 16th century Europe.", "England as yet was a bit player.", "\nAdditionally the Spanish crown controlled vast swathes of central and South America, including modern Mexico (\u2018New Spain\u2019), and most of what is now Spanish-speaking South America (the Vice-Royalty of Peru).", "From there the Spaniards shipped back huge quantities of gold and other precious metals, which funded further conquests.", "Phillip\u2019s empire also included the modern Philippines, and since the union with Portugal, the coast of modern Brazil and outposts in India and Africa as well.\nEngland by contrast, was not yet a major European power.", "It had no permanent standing army and though it controlled (as yet shakily) the Kingdom of Ireland, its foreign possessions paled in comparison with those of the Spanish monarchy \u2013 including only some outposts in north America and in modern Bangladesh.", "\nThe Anglo Spanish War broke out against the background of religious turmoil in Europe.", "The Protestant \u2018Reformation\u2019 aimed initially at Reforming the Catholic Church had by the late 16 th century, hardened into a number of breakaway Christian faiths.", "At a time when the monarch was generally taken to be \u2018God\u2019s anointed\u2019, where the subjects and the monarch differed over religion it almost inevitably led to civil war, as it did in France, the German states and, since the 1560s, between the Catholic Spanish rulers of the Netherlands (modern Netherlands and Belgium) and their predominantly Calvinist Dutch subjects.", "\nRivalry between Spain and England was part religious warfare and part strategic competition.", "\nBetween England and Spain and between their monarchs Phillip II and Elizabeth I there was personal religious animosity.", "Elizabeth\u2019s father Henry VIII had broken with the papacy but his daughter Mary I, product of Henry\u2019s marriage to a Spanish princess had reversed Henry\u2019s policy and restored Catholicism as state religion.", "Mary married Phillip II of Spain who was thus (joint) King of England and Ireland with Mary between 1553 and Mary\u2019s death, without children, in 1558.", "\nWhen Elizabeth Tudor, who had been imprisoned under her sister Mary, took over as queen she reversed the counter-reformation and founded an enduring Protestant monarchy with a state Church of England.", "\nThis was a blow to Phillip\u2019s pride, his religious scruples and represented a loss of a strategic ally, but was not enough in itself to spark war between England and Spain.", "\nStarting in 1562, Elizabeth authorized English \u2018privateers\u2019 that is freelance naval captains, to raid Spanish shipping crossing the Atlantic.", "As so much of Spanish wealth depended on the importation of American gold this was a very serious potential risk to Spanish interests.", "\nThe stakes were further raised with the outbreak of rebellion against the Elizabethan English state in both northern England and southern Ireland (the First Desmond Rebellion , which last until 1573) in 1569.", "Both revolts had an aspect of Catholic crusade.", "The Pope Pius V formally excommunicated Elizabeth in 1570.", "This was a very serious matter as it meant that any Catholic monarch could legitimately overthrow her and that rebellions against her now had religious sanction.", "[2]\nThe Spanish decision to invade England and depose Elizabeth was taken after raids on Spanish shipping in the Atlantic and Carribean in 1586.", "\nBoth the Spaniards and the Papacy gave military aid to Irish Catholic Geraldine rebels 1579-80 in the Second Desmond rebellion and a 600 strong Papal force of both Italian and Spanish soldiers landed at Smerwick, in Kerry in 1580 to aid the uprising, only to be captured and massacred by English forces.", "[3]\nFurthermore in 1584, Spain committed itself to fight the spread of Protestantism in France.", "\nBy way of reprisal, England began aid to aid Protestant Dutch rebels against Spain with troops and money 1585.", "So by the mid 1580s, England and Spain were locked in mutually antagonistic rivalry, both aiding what would now be called proxy forces in their respective domains.", "\nHowever the final straw for Phillip II did not come until 1586, when English attacks on shipping off Galicia, the Canaries and the Caribbean caused significant losses in ships and cargo.", "Losses on this scale could not be allowed to continue and it was only now that Phillip II directed his ministers to prepare for an invasion of England to force a change of regime.", "[4]\nWhere did Ireland fit in to this conflict?", "\nIreland prior to 1542 had been a \u2018Lordship\u2019 of the monarch of England.", "It was only in that year that that Henry VIII declared the Kingdom of Ireland and himself as King of Ireland.", "It was one thing however to proclaim himself thus and a very different thing to actually control the whole island.", "\nAt that date English Crown control extended no further than the Pale, a small fortified area based around Dublin on the east coast and a handful of coastal towns such as Waterford and Cork.", "Outside of that were dozens of what amounted to small kingdoms, some of which were controlled by lords of mixed Irish and English ancestry such as the Fitzgeralds of Kildare and Desmond and the Butlers of Ormonde and others by indigenous Gaelic Irish chieftains.", "\nHenry\u2019s plan was that Irish lords would \u2018surrender\u2019 their lands to him, be re-granted them under English law and become, over generations \u2018civilised\u2019 English aristocrats.", "They would abandon their private armies and also abandon Irish language and customs and also adopt the Protestant state religion.", "The English, throughout the century spoke of a religious and civil \u2018reformation\u2019 in Ireland.", "\nIreland was in middle of a process of violent absorption into the English monarchy \u2013 what the English described a \u2018civil reformation\u2019.", "\nIt would not be true to say that the Irish lords en masse rejected the advance of the English state in Ireland.", "Many did accommodate themselves to it and adopt English titles.", "But for a complex mixture of reasons, some because they did not want any intrusion into their territory by anyone, some because succession disputes or rivalry between Irish lordships dragged in English forces and also by resistance to the imposition of an alien culture and religion, the English \u2018civilizing mission\u2019 in Ireland was marked by bouts of ferocious military conquest.", "\nThe Desmond Rebellions, in 1569-73 and 1579-83, were a combination of all of these factors and ended in the destruction of the Fitzgerald Earldom of Desmond and the Plantation of Munster with English settlers in the 1580s.", "Historians disagree over the level of Catholic Counter Reformation penetration of Ireland in this period but it is undeniable that the rebels declared themselves to be fighting for the One True Faith against \u2018heresy\u2019 and actively sought military aid from Catholic Europe.", "Refugees from the Desmond wars ended up in Spain and to a lesser extent France.", "\nThe first Irish regiment in Spanish service was born in 1587 when an Irish unit raised under an English Catholic, William Stanley and sent to the Netherlands, defected to the Spanish side.", "[5]\nAs a result Ireland appeared to the Spanish to be an obvious weak point for England, with a restive Catholic population that could be mobilized in their favour.", "\nAs the reception of the Armada off Ireland\u2019s west coast in 1588 would show, however, the reality of Irish politics was far more complex and fragmented.", "\nNowhere was this more apparent than in the western province of Connacht, where much of the Spanish fleet would end up in September 1588.", "\nIn an effort to establish military control over the province, the English created the \u2018Presidency of Connacht\u2019 in 1569.", "The President was an English Military Governor, based in Athlone, whose job it was to enforce English authority, taxes and culture in return for recognising the English titles of designated Irish lords.", "In return, the local chieftains were supposed to give up their private armed forces, except for a small band of personal retainers.", "This was known as the \u2018Composition of Connacht\u2019.", "In 1588 the Lord President was Richard Bingham.", "[6]\nThe \u2018Presidency\u2019 was often brutal and generally unpopular, but was not universally resisted.", "\nThe composition of Connacht was the imposition of English style land-holding on the province overseen by a military governor.", "\nThe Presidency worked to the advantage of the two biggest Lords in Connacht \u2013 O\u2019Brien of Thomond (in modern Clare, then considered part of Connacht) and Burke of Clanricard (in modern south and east Galway), whose leading families kept a firm grip on succession and who consolidated their power over their dependent clans with English backing.", "\nElsewhere though, the English presence provoked serious violence.", "The MacWilliam Burkes of north Mayo, for instance revolted after the English attempted to back an unpopular candidate for chieftain in 1585.", "In the same year, in a scheme known as the Composition of Connacht, Irish titles were abolished and English settlers were introduced into the province, mainly on confiscated monastic land.", "\nThe MacWilliams, joined by other discontented chieftains such as Brian O\u2019Rourke in Leitrim, fought English forces led by President Richard Bingham throughout 1586.", "Only after the slaughter of 800 Scottish gallowglass soldiers they had brought in did they, for the time being, submit.", "[7]\nSo in 1588, when the Spaniards ended up off the coast of Ireland, they may have expected to find a sympathetic Catholic population ready to help them.", "What actually existed however was a highly fragmented political scene, in which the loyalties of individual lords depended not so much on ideology as on their immediate relationship to English power.", "\nBut the Spaniards, of course, never expected to arrive on Ireland\u2019s west coast in 1588.", "\nSpain was no stranger to naval warfare or to seaborne invasions.", "Sixteen years before the attack on England, at the battle of Lepanto 1571, a Spanish-led Catholic fleet \u2013the \u2018Holy League\u2019 \u2013 had crushed the fleet of the Ottoman Turks, hitherto the dominant naval power in the eastern Mediterranean.", "And just six years previously in 1582, Phillip\u2019s forces had successfully mounted an amphibious invasion of the Azores islands, the only Portuguese possession to resist the \u2018Union of Crowns\u2019 with Spain by force.", "[8]\nWhile the invasion of England \u2013 an Atlantic power with formidable maritime expertise \u2013 was a challenge of a different order, it was clear that the Spanish threat to England was real.", "\nInitial Spanish plans included a diversionary landing in Waterford but this was later dropped\nInitially, Spanish strategists came up with a plan for a three pronged attack on England in 1586-87.", "Interestingly, this included a landing at Waterford, in south eastern Ireland in order to draw off English resources from the main assault over the English Channel.", "The Spanish fleet was to draw off its English counterpart as it went to deal with the Irish landing, and meanwhile the Spanish Army of Flanders was to cross the English Chanel unopposed.", "[9]\nAll had to be postponed however after the English naval commander Francis Drake launched a devastating attack on the Spanish port of Cadiz in 1587, destroying many ships and much of their stores.", "\nThe following year the Spaniards came up with a simpler plan.", "The \u2018Invincible Armada\u2019 \u2013 a fleet of 130 warships and supply ships, led by Duke Medina Sidonia \u2013 was to sail from Lisbon via Corunna, link up with the Army of Flanders, led by Allessando Farnese, the Duke of Parma.", "This force, 37,000 soldiers strong, was waiting at Calais to be escorted in a further 260 transport barges across the Channel onto the English coast.", "[10]\nHad the Army of Flanders made it across the English channel there is little doubt there would have been \u2018regime change\u2019 in Protestant England.", "\nThere is little doubt that, had the Army of Flanders crossed into England, the veteran Spanish troops would have swept aside the raw English militias that Elizabeth could put into the field.", "In that event, Elizabeth was to be deposed and Parma was to act as interim military ruler until the Pope and Phillip II named a new, Catholic monarch.", "[11]\nElizabeth herself created a legend by addressing her troops at Tilbury in Essex, assembled (incidentally nowhere near the where the Spaniards intended to land) with the immortal words,\nI know I have the body of a weak, feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma [12] or Spain [13] , or any prince of Europe, should dare to invade the borders of my realm; to which rather than any dishonour shall grow by me, I myself will take up arms, I myself will be your general, judge, and rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field.", "[14]\nStirring words no doubt, but in reality everything, for the English depended on stopping the Spaniards from crossing the channel.", "\nIn this they had some advantages.", "Their fleet may have been smaller than the Armada, but in terms of well armed warships, suitable for northern seas the English may even have had the edge.", "The operation was at the very limits of what the Spanish Empire was able to accomplish.", "Some ships had had to be hijacked in Spanish ports and pressed into service for the invasion.", "Many others were Mediterranean vessels, unsuited for the wild seas of the Atlantic.", "Some cannon had been hurriedly cast and burst when fired.", "\nMost importantly of all, Spanish logistics were insufficient.", "Not enough food or water was supplied and some of it was begin to spoil by the time the great Armada set sail from Corunna.", "Many sailors got sick and supplies were perilously low by the time they reached English waters.", "[15]\nSea battle was joined from July to late August 1588 as the Armada fought its way towards the coast of Flanders.", "It culminated in fierce encounter off the Gravellines, or the coast of the Spanish Netherlands (modern Belgium), with the English attempting desperately to break up the Armada and to prevent it from reaching its rendezvous with the Army of Flanders.", "\nThe English under Admiral Howard succeeded in breaking up the Spanish formation by use of \u2018fire-ships\u2019, vessels set alight with pitch and tar and sent towards the Spanish fleet.", "In the fighting that followed, superior English gunnery managed to bloody the Spaniards somewhat and to keep them away from the Duke of Parma\u2019s army at the disembarkation point at Calais.", "\nSuperior English gunnery prevented the Armada from linking up with its land forces but it was the weather and lack of supplies that defeated it.", "\nHowever, this was a tactical defeat for the Armada, not a catastrophe \u2013 only 5 ships were lost, though many others were damaged.", "Medina Sidonia, in command of the Armada had other problems however.", "Logistics had always been insufficient and now food and water supplies were beginning to run out altogether.", "Moreover, a \u2018Protestant Wind (southerly and westerly), in early September forced the Spanish to head for home, north around the coast of Scotland and Ireland back to Corunna.\n", "This turned out to be a far more costly enterprise than the battle itself.", "\nAs the Armada rounded the northern Irish coast, it was in dire need of re-provision of both food and water.", "For this reason the fleet had to approach the unfamiliar coast of Ireland.", "There it was hit by westerly gales and crashed into the rocky Atlantic coast.", "In all 24 ships and c.5-7000 men lost off Ireland, mostly by drowning.", "All sailing ships were, to a degree, at the mercy of the weather, the Armada, many of whose vessels were built for the much calmer Mediterranean, was more vulnerable than most.", "\nThe Annals of the Four Masters recorded;\nGreat numbers of the Spaniards were drowned, and their ships were totally wrecked in those places.", "The smaller part of them returned to Spain; and some say that nine thousand of them were lost on this occasion.", "[16]\nThose who made it ashore generally fared little better than those lost at sea.", "\nThe Armada lost far more ships and men wrecked off Ireland than it battle with the English fleet.", "\nThe English Lord Deputy of Ireland, Fitzwilliam, issued a proclamation whereby \u2018Harbouring Castaways\u2019 was punishable by death.", "To his own officers he wrote;\n\u2018Whereas the distressed fleet of the Spaniards by tempest and contrary winds, though the providence of God have been driven on the coast\u2026 where it is thought, great treasure and also ordinance, munitions [and] armour hath been cast.", "We authorize you to\u2026 to haul all hulls and to apprehend and execute all Spaniards found there of any quality soever.", "Torture May be used in prosecuting this inquiry.\u2019", "[17]\nThis chilling order, not to spare prisoners \u2018of any quality [i.e. rank or social status] whatsoever\u2019 was startlingly ruthless.", "Accordingly Richard Bingham, the President of Connacht, and his brother George Bingham, executed up to 1,100 Spanish survivors of the wrecks who made it ashore in the western province.", "For instance, at Galway city, 300 Spanish prisoners including 40 aristocrats were beheaded on Fitzwilliam\u2019s orders \u2013 though Bingham apparently regretted the loss of ransom money.", "Only a handful such as Don Luis de Cordoba, managed to secretly buy their way to safety.", "[18]\nEnglish treatment of Spanish prisoners in Ireland was ruthless, almost all were killed.", "\nNative Irish treatment of the Spanish survivors was extremely varied.", "\n", "In Connacht, most Irish lords cooperated with Bingham, particularly the largest lords O\u2019Brien, Earl of Thomond, and Burke, Earl of Clanricarde.", "Other clans such as the O\u2019Flahertys also handed over Spanish prisoners.", "Others, seem simply to have seen the Armada as an opportunity for personal gain.", "Dubhdarach O\u2019Malley Roe, on Clare Island, for instance killed the Spanish survivors and kept their gold for himself.", "\n", "Elsewhere, at Streedagh in modern County Sligo for instance, where four ships were lost, the locals robbed the Spaniards of any valuables they could find, but did not kill them.", "\nHowever, in modern north Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim, areas which had very recently been in armed revolt against the English Crown \u2013 chieftains such as MacWilliam Burke, and Brian O\u2019Rourke harboured Spaniards.", "[19]\nThough some Irish lords sheltered the Spaniards, it seems the majority either looted them or handed them over to the English.", "\nA rather ungrateful captain, Francisco de Cuellar, who was taken in by O\u2019Rourke, wrote of \u2018passing seven months among mountains and woods with savages\u2019.", "Cuellar was shipwrecked on Streedagh beach, Sligo, spoke first of the \u2018savages\u2019 stripping and looting his ship, and the \u2018English Lutherans\u2019 hanging or cutting off the heads of his comrades wherever they captured them.", "\nO\u2019Rourke, whom he described as \u2018a savage but a very good Christian and an enemy of the heretics, always carrying on war with them\u2019, sent him through the territory of several other friendly clans including the McClancys and the O\u2019Cahans to Derry, from where he secretly took ship back to the Spanish Netherlands.", "[20]\nAlthough Cuellar reported that the Catholic Irish, with whom he conversed in Latin, repeatedly asked for a Spanish invasion, the Irish Annals were clear that, apart from O\u2019Rourke and his allies, most of the Irish had sided with the Crown;\nA great army was mustered by the Lord Justice of Ireland, Sir William Fitzwilliam; Sir Richard Bingham, Governor of the province of Connaught; and Sir Thomas Norris, Governor of the two provinces of Munster; together with the most of the men of Ireland\u2026 except the people of Ulster, the O\u2019Rourke and Mac Sweeny-na-dTuath, who had formed friendship and alliance with some of the Spanish fleet which we have before mentioned.", "These forces spoiled every thing to which they came in their course, not belonging to the Queen\u2019s people, from the Suck to the Drowes, and from the Drowes to the Finn.", "[21]\nIn Ulster, which was still largely outside of English control, the Spaniards seem to have fared somewhat better, at least if they survived shipwreck.", "In Antrim the Scottish/Irish MacDonnell clan led by Sorley Boy (Somhairle Buidh) helped up to 500 Spaniards escape to Scotland.", "[22] .", "\nThe position of Hugh O\u2019Neill, Earl of Tyrone, the most powerful northern leader, at this point still proclaiming himself a loyal subject to Elizabeth I, was hard to pin down.", "He sheltered and kept on a number of Spanish commanders to train his own forces, whom he was soon to lead in a war against the Elizabethan state.", "[23] Nevertheless, he also reported to

September 16, 1588 seven Spanish ships appeared off Liscannor, sighted by Nicholas Cahane, an agent of Boetius Clancy, the High Sherriff of County Clare. They were the miserable remnants of a once mighty Spanish fleet.\nThey anchored off Kilrush, where the starving sailors attempted to trade with the locals for food and water. Six ships sailed away unscathed, but another, the Annunciada sank off Scattery Island, was set alight by crew and looted by locals. Two other ships were also lost: the San Estaban and San Marcos , with the loss of around 800 lives.\nCrawling ashore, half drowned, malnourished and in no fit state to resist, the survivors, about 300 men, were massacred at Spanish Point by both Irish forces raised by the O\u2019Briens and English soldiers led by the Sherriff, Boetius Clancy. [1]\nThe Spanish Armada, also known as the \u2018Invincible Armada\u2019 ( La Armada Invencible ), was an attempt by the Spanish King Phillip II at a seaborne invasion of the Kingdom of England. The Armada was the culmination of long running rivalry between England and Spain over strategic, trade and religious issues.\nThe Spanish Armada was the Spanish fleet charged with escorting the Spanish Army of Flanders to England\u2019s shores.\nThe \u2018Armada\u2019 itself refers to the Spanish fleet assembled for the operation, which was intended to escort the Spanish Army of Flanders across the English channel, past the English fleet. Although Ireland had featured in previous drafts of Spanish invasion plans, it did not form a part of Spanish strategy in 1588.\nNevertheless, Ireland was, in the end, central to the defeat of the Armada. The Spanish fleet was blown north and west around the western Irish coast. As many as 27 ships and perhaps up to 9,000 Spanish soldiers and sailors lost their lives off the Atlantic coast of Ireland, either through drowning or were killed by English troops or Irish chieftains after they were washed ashore.\nAt the same time some Irish who were sympathetic to the Spaniards sheltered them and some kept them on as soldiers.\nSpain was the leading power in Europe and arguably the world. Phillip II of the house of Habsburg inherited European possessions including not only the Spanish kingdoms of Castille and Aragon, but also the Kingdom of Naples in southern Italy, the Italian islands of Sardinia and Sicily, several principalities in northern Italy and what was then known as the Spanish Netherlands.\nIn 1580-81 when the King of Portugal died without an heir, Phillip managed to make himself head of that kingdom too, together with its Atlantic fleet and overseas possessions.\nSpain was the superpower of 16th century Europe. England as yet was a bit player.\nAdditionally the Spanish crown controlled vast swathes of central and South America, including modern Mexico (\u2018New Spain\u2019), and most of what is now Spanish-speaking South America (the Vice-Royalty of Peru). From there the Spaniards shipped back huge quantities of gold and other precious metals, which funded further conquests. Phillip\u2019s empire also included the modern Philippines, and since the union with Portugal, the coast of modern Brazil and outposts in India and Africa as well.\nEngland by contrast, was not yet a major European power. It had no permanent standing army and though it controlled (as yet shakily) the Kingdom of Ireland, its foreign possessions paled in comparison with those of the Spanish monarchy \u2013 including only some outposts in north America and in modern Bangladesh.\nThe Anglo Spanish War broke out against the background of religious turmoil in Europe. The Protestant \u2018Reformation\u2019 aimed initially at Reforming the Catholic Church had by the late 16 th century, hardened into a number of breakaway Christian faiths. At a time when the monarch was generally taken to be \u2018God\u2019s anointed\u2019, where the subjects and the monarch differed over religion it almost inevitably led to civil war, as it did in France, the German states and, since the 1560s, between the Catholic Spanish rulers of the Netherlands (modern Netherlands and Belgium) and their predominantly Calvinist Dutch subjects.\nRivalry between Spain and England was part religious warfare and part strategic competition.\nBetween England and Spain and between their monarchs Phillip II and Elizabeth I there was personal religious animosity. Elizabeth\u2019s father Henry VIII had broken with the papacy but his daughter Mary I, product of Henry\u2019s marriage to a Spanish princess had reversed Henry\u2019s policy and restored Catholicism as state religion. Mary married Phillip II of Spain who was thus (joint) King of England and Ireland with Mary between 1553 and Mary\u2019s death, without children, in 1558.\nWhen Elizabeth Tudor, who had been imprisoned under her sister Mary, took over as queen she reversed the counter-reformation and founded an enduring Protestant monarchy with a state Church of England.\nThis was a blow to Phillip\u2019s pride, his religious scruples and represented a loss of a strategic ally, but was not enough in itself to spark war between England and Spain.\nStarting in 1562, Elizabeth authorized English \u2018privateers\u2019 that is freelance naval captains, to raid Spanish shipping crossing the Atlantic. As so much of Spanish wealth depended on the importation of American gold this was a very serious potential risk to Spanish interests.\nThe stakes were further raised with the outbreak of rebellion against the Elizabethan English state in both northern England and southern Ireland (the First Desmond Rebellion , which last until 1573) in 1569. Both revolts had an aspect of Catholic crusade. The Pope Pius V formally excommunicated Elizabeth in 1570. This was a very serious matter as it meant that any Catholic monarch could legitimately overthrow her and that rebellions against her now had religious sanction. [2]\nThe Spanish decision to invade England and depose Elizabeth was taken after raids on Spanish shipping in the Atlantic and Carribean in 1586.\nBoth the Spaniards and the Papacy gave military aid to Irish Catholic Geraldine rebels 1579-80 in the Second Desmond rebellion and a 600 strong Papal force of both Italian and Spanish soldiers landed at Smerwick, in Kerry in 1580 to aid the uprising, only to be captured and massacred by English forces. [3]\nFurthermore in 1584, Spain committed itself to fight the spread of Protestantism in France.\nBy way of reprisal, England began aid to aid Protestant Dutch rebels against Spain with troops and money 1585. So by the mid 1580s, England and Spain were locked in mutually antagonistic rivalry, both aiding what would now be called proxy forces in their respective domains.\nHowever the final straw for Phillip II did not come until 1586, when English attacks on shipping off Galicia, the Canaries and the Caribbean caused significant losses in ships and cargo. Losses on this scale could not be allowed to continue and it was only now that Phillip II directed his ministers to prepare for an invasion of England to force a change of regime. [4]\nWhere did Ireland fit in to this conflict?\nIreland prior to 1542 had been a \u2018Lordship\u2019 of the monarch of England. It was only in that year that that Henry VIII declared the Kingdom of Ireland and himself as King of Ireland. It was one thing however to proclaim himself thus and a very different thing to actually control the whole island.\nAt that date English Crown control extended no further than the Pale, a small fortified area based around Dublin on the east coast and a handful of coastal towns such as Waterford and Cork. Outside of that were dozens of what amounted to small kingdoms, some of which were controlled by lords of mixed Irish and English ancestry such as the Fitzgeralds of Kildare and Desmond and the Butlers of Ormonde and others by indigenous Gaelic Irish chieftains.\nHenry\u2019s plan was that Irish lords would \u2018surrender\u2019 their lands to him, be re-granted them under English law and become, over generations \u2018civilised\u2019 English aristocrats. They would abandon their private armies and also abandon Irish language and customs and also adopt the Protestant state religion. The English, throughout the century spoke of a religious and civil \u2018reformation\u2019 in Ireland.\nIreland was in middle of a process of violent absorption into the English monarchy \u2013 what the English described a \u2018civil reformation\u2019.\nIt would not be true to say that the Irish lords en masse rejected the advance of the English state in Ireland. Many did accommodate themselves to it and adopt English titles. But for a complex mixture of reasons, some because they did not want any intrusion into their territory by anyone, some because succession disputes or rivalry between Irish lordships dragged in English forces and also by resistance to the imposition of an alien culture and religion, the English \u2018civilizing mission\u2019 in Ireland was marked by bouts of ferocious military conquest.\nThe Desmond Rebellions, in 1569-73 and 1579-83, were a combination of all of these factors and ended in the destruction of the Fitzgerald Earldom of Desmond and the Plantation of Munster with English settlers in the 1580s. Historians disagree over the level of Catholic Counter Reformation penetration of Ireland in this period but it is undeniable that the rebels declared themselves to be fighting for the One True Faith against \u2018heresy\u2019 and actively sought military aid from Catholic Europe. Refugees from the Desmond wars ended up in Spain and to a lesser extent France.\nThe first Irish regiment in Spanish service was born in 1587 when an Irish unit raised under an English Catholic, William Stanley and sent to the Netherlands, defected to the Spanish side. [5]\nAs a result Ireland appeared to the Spanish to be an obvious weak point for England, with a restive Catholic population that could be mobilized in their favour.\nAs the reception of the Armada off Ireland\u2019s west coast in 1588 would show, however, the reality of Irish politics was far more complex and fragmented.\nNowhere was this more apparent than in the western province of Connacht, where much of the Spanish fleet would end up in September 1588.\nIn an effort to establish military control over the province, the English created the \u2018Presidency of Connacht\u2019 in 1569. The President was an English Military Governor, based in Athlone, whose job it was to enforce English authority, taxes and culture in return for recognising the English titles of designated Irish lords. In return, the local chieftains were supposed to give up their private armed forces, except for a small band of personal retainers. This was known as the \u2018Composition of Connacht\u2019. In 1588 the Lord President was Richard Bingham. [6]\nThe \u2018Presidency\u2019 was often brutal and generally unpopular, but was not universally resisted.\nThe composition of Connacht was the imposition of English style land-holding on the province overseen by a military governor.\nThe Presidency worked to the advantage of the two biggest Lords in Connacht \u2013 O\u2019Brien of Thomond (in modern Clare, then considered part of Connacht) and Burke of Clanricard (in modern south and east Galway), whose leading families kept a firm grip on succession and who consolidated their power over their dependent clans with English backing.\nElsewhere though, the English presence provoked serious violence. The MacWilliam Burkes of north Mayo, for instance revolted after the English attempted to back an unpopular candidate for chieftain in 1585. In the same year, in a scheme known as the Composition of Connacht, Irish titles were abolished and English settlers were introduced into the province, mainly on confiscated monastic land.\nThe MacWilliams, joined by other discontented chieftains such as Brian O\u2019Rourke in Leitrim, fought English forces led by President Richard Bingham throughout 1586. Only after the slaughter of 800 Scottish gallowglass soldiers they had brought in did they, for the time being, submit. [7]\nSo in 1588, when the Spaniards ended up off the coast of Ireland, they may have expected to find a sympathetic Catholic population ready to help them. What actually existed however was a highly fragmented political scene, in which the loyalties of individual lords depended not so much on ideology as on their immediate relationship to English power.\nBut the Spaniards, of course, never expected to arrive on Ireland\u2019s west coast in 1588.\nSpain was no stranger to naval warfare or to seaborne invasions. Sixteen years before the attack on England, at the battle of Lepanto 1571, a Spanish-led Catholic fleet \u2013the \u2018Holy League\u2019 \u2013 had crushed the fleet of the Ottoman Turks, hitherto the dominant naval power in the eastern Mediterranean. And just six years previously in 1582, Phillip\u2019s forces had successfully mounted an amphibious invasion of the Azores islands, the only Portuguese possession to resist the \u2018Union of Crowns\u2019 with Spain by force. [8]\nWhile the invasion of England \u2013 an Atlantic power with formidable maritime expertise \u2013 was a challenge of a different order, it was clear that the Spanish threat to England was real.\nInitial Spanish plans included a diversionary landing in Waterford but this was later dropped\nInitially, Spanish strategists came up with a plan for a three pronged attack on England in 1586-87. Interestingly, this included a landing at Waterford, in south eastern Ireland in order to draw off English resources from the main assault over the English Channel. The Spanish fleet was to draw off its English counterpart as it went to deal with the Irish landing, and meanwhile the Spanish Army of Flanders was to cross the English Chanel unopposed. [9]\nAll had to be postponed however after the English naval commander Francis Drake launched a devastating attack on the Spanish port of Cadiz in 1587, destroying many ships and much of their stores.\nThe following year the Spaniards came up with a simpler plan. The \u2018Invincible Armada\u2019 \u2013 a fleet of 130 warships and supply ships, led by Duke Medina Sidonia \u2013 was to sail from Lisbon via Corunna, link up with the Army of Flanders, led by Allessando Farnese, the Duke of Parma. This force, 37,000 soldiers strong, was waiting at Calais to be escorted in a further 260 transport barges across the Channel onto the English coast. [10]\nHad the Army of Flanders made it across the English channel there is little doubt there would have been \u2018regime change\u2019 in Protestant England.\nThere is little doubt that, had the Army of Flanders crossed into England, the veteran Spanish troops would have swept aside the raw English militias that Elizabeth could put into the field. In that event, Elizabeth was to be deposed and Parma was to act as interim military ruler until the Pope and Phillip II named a new, Catholic monarch. [11]\nElizabeth herself created a legend by addressing her troops at Tilbury in Essex, assembled (incidentally nowhere near the where the Spaniards intended to land) with the immortal words,\nI know I have the body of a weak, feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma [12] or Spain [13] , or any prince of Europe, should dare to invade the borders of my realm; to which rather than any dishonour shall grow by me, I myself will take up arms, I myself will be your general, judge, and rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field. [14]\nStirring words no doubt, but in reality everything, for the English depended on stopping the Spaniards from crossing the channel.\nIn this they had some advantages. Their fleet may have been smaller than the Armada, but in terms of well armed warships, suitable for northern seas the English may even have had the edge. The operation was at the very limits of what the Spanish Empire was able to accomplish. Some ships had had to be hijacked in Spanish ports and pressed into service for the invasion. Many others were Mediterranean vessels, unsuited for the wild seas of the Atlantic. Some cannon had been hurriedly cast and burst when fired.\nMost importantly of all, Spanish logistics were insufficient. Not enough food or water was supplied and some of it was begin to spoil by the time the great Armada set sail from Corunna. Many sailors got sick and supplies were perilously low by the time they reached English waters. [15]\nSea battle was joined from July to late August 1588 as the Armada fought its way towards the coast of Flanders. It culminated in fierce encounter off the Gravellines, or the coast of the Spanish Netherlands (modern Belgium), with the English attempting desperately to break up the Armada and to prevent it from reaching its rendezvous with the Army of Flanders.\nThe English under Admiral Howard succeeded in breaking up the Spanish formation by use of \u2018fire-ships\u2019, vessels set alight with pitch and tar and sent towards the Spanish fleet. In the fighting that followed, superior English gunnery managed to bloody the Spaniards somewhat and to keep them away from the Duke of Parma\u2019s army at the disembarkation point at Calais.\nSuperior English gunnery prevented the Armada from linking up with its land forces but it was the weather and lack of supplies that defeated it.\nHowever, this was a tactical defeat for the Armada, not a catastrophe \u2013 only 5 ships were lost, though many others were damaged. Medina Sidonia, in command of the Armada had other problems however. Logistics had always been insufficient and now food and water supplies were beginning to run out altogether. Moreover, a \u2018Protestant Wind (southerly and westerly), in early September forced the Spanish to head for home, north around the coast of Scotland and Ireland back to Corunna.\nThis turned out to be a far more costly enterprise than the battle itself.\nAs the Armada rounded the northern Irish coast, it was in dire need of re-provision of both food and water. For this reason the fleet had to approach the unfamiliar coast of Ireland. There it was hit by westerly gales and crashed into the rocky Atlantic coast. In all 24 ships and c.5-7000 men lost off Ireland, mostly by drowning. All sailing ships were, to a degree, at the mercy of the weather, the Armada, many of whose vessels were built for the much calmer Mediterranean, was more vulnerable than most.\nThe Annals of the Four Masters recorded;\nGreat numbers of the Spaniards were drowned, and their ships were totally wrecked in those places. The smaller part of them returned to Spain; and some say that nine thousand of them were lost on this occasion. [16]\nThose who made it ashore generally fared little better than those lost at sea.\nThe Armada lost far more ships and men wrecked off Ireland than it battle with the English fleet.\nThe English Lord Deputy of Ireland, Fitzwilliam, issued a proclamation whereby \u2018Harbouring Castaways\u2019 was punishable by death. To his own officers he wrote;\n\u2018Whereas the distressed fleet of the Spaniards by tempest and contrary winds, though the providence of God have been driven on the coast\u2026 where it is thought, great treasure and also ordinance, munitions [and] armour hath been cast. We authorize you to\u2026 to haul all hulls and to apprehend and execute all Spaniards found there of any quality soever. Torture May be used in prosecuting this inquiry.\u2019 [17]\nThis chilling order, not to spare prisoners \u2018of any quality [i.e. rank or social status] whatsoever\u2019 was startlingly ruthless. Accordingly Richard Bingham, the President of Connacht, and his brother George Bingham, executed up to 1,100 Spanish survivors of the wrecks who made it ashore in the western province. For instance, at Galway city, 300 Spanish prisoners including 40 aristocrats were beheaded on Fitzwilliam\u2019s orders \u2013 though Bingham apparently regretted the loss of ransom money. Only a handful such as Don Luis de Cordoba, managed to secretly buy their way to safety. [18]\nEnglish treatment of Spanish prisoners in Ireland was ruthless, almost all were killed.\nNative Irish treatment of the Spanish survivors was extremely varied.\nIn Connacht, most Irish lords cooperated with Bingham, particularly the largest lords O\u2019Brien, Earl of Thomond, and Burke, Earl of Clanricarde. Other clans such as the O\u2019Flahertys also handed over Spanish prisoners. Others, seem simply to have seen the Armada as an opportunity for personal gain. Dubhdarach O\u2019Malley Roe, on Clare Island, for instance killed the Spanish survivors and kept their gold for himself.\nElsewhere, at Streedagh in modern County Sligo for instance, where four ships were lost, the locals robbed the Spaniards of any valuables they could find, but did not kill them.\nHowever, in modern north Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim, areas which had very recently been in armed revolt against the English Crown \u2013 chieftains such as MacWilliam Burke, and Brian O\u2019Rourke harboured Spaniards. [19]\nThough some Irish lords sheltered the Spaniards, it seems the majority either looted them or handed them over to the English.\nA rather ungrateful captain, Francisco de Cuellar, who was taken in by O\u2019Rourke, wrote of \u2018passing seven months among mountains and woods with savages\u2019. Cuellar was shipwrecked on Streedagh beach, Sligo, spoke first of the \u2018savages\u2019 stripping and looting his ship, and the \u2018English Lutherans\u2019 hanging or cutting off the heads of his comrades wherever they captured them.\nO\u2019Rourke, whom he described as \u2018a savage but a very good Christian and an enemy of the heretics, always carrying on war with them\u2019, sent him through the territory of several other friendly clans including the McClancys and the O\u2019Cahans to Derry, from where he secretly took ship back to the Spanish Netherlands. [20]\nAlthough Cuellar reported that the Catholic Irish, with whom he conversed in Latin, repeatedly asked for a Spanish invasion, the Irish Annals were clear that, apart from O\u2019Rourke and his allies, most of the Irish had sided with the Crown;\nA great army was mustered by the Lord Justice of Ireland, Sir William Fitzwilliam; Sir Richard Bingham, Governor of the province of Connaught; and Sir Thomas Norris, Governor of the two provinces of Munster; together with the most of the men of Ireland\u2026 except the people of Ulster, the O\u2019Rourke and Mac Sweeny-na-dTuath, who had formed friendship and alliance with some of the Spanish fleet which we have before mentioned. These forces spoiled every thing to which they came in their course, not belonging to the Queen\u2019s people, from the Suck to the Drowes, and from the Drowes to the Finn. [21]\nIn Ulster, which was still largely outside of English control, the Spaniards seem to have fared somewhat better, at least if they survived shipwreck. In Antrim the Scottish/Irish MacDonnell clan led by Sorley Boy (Somhairle Buidh) helped up to 500 Spaniards escape to Scotland. [22] .\nThe position of Hugh O\u2019Neill, Earl of Tyrone, the most powerful northern leader, at this point still proclaiming himself a loyal subject to Elizabeth I, was hard to pin down. He sheltered and kept on a number of Spanish commanders to train his own forces, whom he was soon to lead in a war against the Elizabethan state. [23] Nevertheless, he also reported to Fitzwilliam the Lord Deputy that he had \u2018put a large number of Spaniards to the sword\u2019 in Inishowen (modern Donegal). [24]\nIronically enough, those Spaniards lucky enough to be shipwrecked in England itself were generally treated much more leniently. Most were taken prisoner and eventually repatriated.\nIreland, where English authority was tenuous enough for them feel that extreme ruthlessness was a necessity, was the real grave of the \u2018Invincible Armada\u2019.\nThe defeat of the Armada, as much by bad weather, poor planning and bad luck as by battle, seemed a providential escape to English Protestants \u2013 literally gift sent by God. Nevertheless, war between England and Spain continued indecisively until 1604 \u2013 an \u2018English Armada\u2019, sent to destroy the port at Corruna 1589 was itself defeated with 40 ships sunk and 10,000 men lost.\nIn Ireland itself the immediate effects of the Armada are hard to gauge. The frantic military activity all over the west destabilized the always fragile political situation there. North Connacht rose in rebellion again in 1589, though again, mainly over local grievances.

They were the miserable remnants of a once mighty Spanish fleet. They anchored off Kilrush, where the starving sailors attempted to trade with the locals for food and water. Six ships sailed away unscathed, but another, the Annunciada sank off Scattery Island, was set alight by crew and looted by locals. Two other ships were also lost: the San Estaban and San Marcos , with the loss of around 800 lives. Crawling ashore, half drowned, malnourished and in no fit state to resist, the survivors, about 300 men, were massacred at Spanish Point by both Irish forces raised by the O\u2019Briens and English soldiers led by the Sherriff, Boetius Clancy. [1] The Spanish Armada, also known as the \u2018Invincible Armada\u2019 ( La Armada Invencible ), was an attempt by the Spanish King Phillip II at a seaborne invasion of the Kingdom of England. The Armada was the culmination of long running rivalry between England and Spain over strategic, trade and religious issues. The Spanish Armada was the Spanish fleet charged with escorting the Spanish Army of Flanders to England\u2019s shores. The \u2018Armada\u2019 itself refers to the Spanish fleet assembled for the operation, which was intended to escort the Spanish Army of Flanders across the English channel, past the English fleet. Although Ireland had featured in previous drafts of Spanish invasion plans, it did not form a part of Spanish strategy in 1588. Nevertheless, Ireland was, in the end, central to the defeat of the Armada. The Spanish fleet was blown north and west around the western Irish coast. As many as 27 ships and perhaps up to 9,000 Spanish soldiers and sailors lost their lives off the Atlantic coast of Ireland, either through drowning or were killed by English troops or Irish chieftains after they were washed ashore. At the same time some Irish who were sympathetic to the Spaniards sheltered them and some kept them on as soldiers. Spain was the leading power in Europe and arguably the world. Phillip II of the house of Habsburg inherited European possessions including not only the Spanish kingdoms of Castille and Aragon, but also the Kingdom of Naples in southern Italy, the Italian islands of Sardinia and Sicily, several principalities in northern Italy and what was then known as the Spanish Netherlands. In 1580-81 when the King of Portugal died without an heir, Phillip managed to make himself head of that kingdom too, together with its Atlantic fleet and overseas possessions. Spain was the superpower of 16th century Europe. England as yet was a bit player. Additionally the Spanish crown controlled vast swathes of central and South America, including modern Mexico (\u2018New Spain\u2019), and most of what is now Spanish-speaking South America (the Vice-Royalty of Peru). From there the Spaniards shipped back huge quantities of gold and other precious metals, which funded further conquests. Phillip\u2019s empire also included the modern Philippines, and since the union with Portugal, the coast of modern Brazil and outposts in India and Africa as well. England by contrast, was not yet a major European power. It had no permanent standing army and though it controlled (as yet shakily) the Kingdom of Ireland, its foreign possessions paled in comparison with those of the Spanish monarchy \u2013 including only some outposts in north America and in modern Bangladesh. The Anglo Spanish War broke out against the background of religious turmoil in Europe. The Protestant \u2018Reformation\u2019 aimed initially at Reforming the Catholic Church had by the late 16 th century, hardened into a number of breakaway Christian faiths. At a time when the monarch was generally taken to be \u2018God\u2019s anointed\u2019, where the subjects and the monarch differed over religion it almost inevitably led to civil war, as it did in France, the German states and, since the 1560s, between the Catholic Spanish rulers of the Netherlands (modern Netherlands and Belgium) and their predominantly Calvinist Dutch subjects. Rivalry between Spain and England was part religious warfare and part strategic competition. Between England and Spain and between their monarchs Phillip II and Elizabeth I there was personal religious animosity. Elizabeth\u2019s father Henry VIII had broken with the papacy but his daughter Mary I, product of Henry\u2019s marriage to a Spanish princess had reversed Henry\u2019s policy and restored Catholicism as state religion. Mary married Phillip II of Spain who was thus (joint) King of England and Ireland with Mary between 1553 and Mary\u2019s death, without children, in 1558. When Elizabeth Tudor, who had been imprisoned under her sister Mary, took over as queen she reversed the counter-reformation and founded an enduring Protestant monarchy with a state Church of England. This was a blow to Phillip\u2019s pride, his religious scruples and represented a loss of a strategic ally, but was not enough in itself to spark war between England and Spain. Starting in 1562, Elizabeth authorized English \u2018privateers\u2019 that is freelance naval captains, to raid Spanish shipping crossing the Atlantic. As so much of Spanish wealth depended on the importation of American gold this was a very serious potential risk to Spanish interests. The stakes were further raised with the outbreak of rebellion against the Elizabethan English state in both northern England and southern Ireland (the First Desmond Rebellion , which last until 1573) in 1569. Both revolts had an aspect of Catholic crusade. The Pope Pius V formally excommunicated Elizabeth in 1570. This was a very serious matter as it meant that any Catholic monarch could legitimately overthrow her and that rebellions against her now had religious sanction. [2] The Spanish decision to invade England and depose Elizabeth was taken after raids on Spanish shipping in the Atlantic and Carribean in 1586. Both the Spaniards and the Papacy gave military aid to Irish Catholic Geraldine rebels 1579-80 in the Second Desmond rebellion and a 600 strong Papal force of both Italian and Spanish soldiers landed at Smerwick, in Kerry in 1580 to aid the uprising, only to be captured and massacred by English forces. [3] Furthermore in 1584, Spain committed itself to fight the spread of Protestantism in France. By way of reprisal, England began aid to aid Protestant Dutch rebels against Spain with troops and money 1585. So by the mid 1580s, England and Spain were locked in mutually antagonistic rivalry, both aiding what would now be called proxy forces in their respective domains. However the final straw for Phillip II did not come until 1586, when English attacks on shipping off Galicia, the Canaries and the Caribbean caused significant losses in ships and cargo. Losses on this scale could not be allowed to continue and it was only now that Phillip II directed his ministers to prepare for an invasion of England to force a change of regime. [4] Where did Ireland fit in to this conflict? Ireland prior to 1542 had been a \u2018Lordship\u2019 of the monarch of England. It was only in that year that that Henry VIII declared the Kingdom of Ireland and himself as King of Ireland. It was one thing however to proclaim himself thus and a very different thing to actually control the whole island. At that date English Crown control extended no further than the Pale, a small fortified area based around Dublin on the east coast and a handful of coastal towns such as Waterford and Cork. Outside of that were dozens of what amounted to small kingdoms, some of which were controlled by lords of mixed Irish and English ancestry such as the Fitzgeralds of Kildare and Desmond and the Butlers of Ormonde and others by indigenous Gaelic Irish chieftains. Henry\u2019s plan was that Irish lords would \u2018surrender\u2019 their lands to him, be re-granted them under English law and become, over generations \u2018civilised\u2019 English aristocrats. They would abandon their private armies and also abandon Irish language and customs and also adopt the Protestant state religion. The English, throughout the century spoke of a religious and civil \u2018reformation\u2019 in Ireland. Ireland was in middle of a process of violent absorption into the English monarchy \u2013 what the English described a \u2018civil reformation\u2019. It would not be true to say that the Irish lords en masse rejected the advance of the English state in Ireland. Many did accommodate themselves to it and adopt English titles. But for a complex mixture of reasons, some because they did not want any intrusion into their territory by anyone, some because succession disputes or rivalry between Irish lordships dragged in English forces and also by resistance to the imposition of an alien culture and religion, the English \u2018civilizing mission\u2019 in Ireland was marked by bouts of ferocious military conquest. The Desmond Rebellions, in 1569-73 and 1579-83, were a combination of all of these factors and ended in the destruction of the Fitzgerald Earldom of Desmond and the Plantation of Munster with English settlers in the 1580s. Historians disagree over the level of Catholic Counter Reformation penetration of Ireland in this period but it is undeniable that the rebels declared themselves to be fighting for the One True Faith against \u2018heresy\u2019 and actively sought military aid from Catholic Europe. Refugees from the Desmond wars ended up in Spain and to a lesser extent France. The first Irish regiment in Spanish service was born in 1587 when an Irish unit raised under an English Catholic, William Stanley and sent to the Netherlands, defected to the Spanish side. [5] As a result Ireland appeared to the Spanish to be an obvious weak point for England, with a restive Catholic population that could be mobilized in their favour. As the reception of the Armada off Ireland\u2019s west coast in 1588 would show, however, the reality of Irish politics was far more complex and fragmented. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the western province of Connacht, where much of the Spanish fleet would end up in September 1588. In an effort to establish military control over the province, the English created the \u2018Presidency of Connacht\u2019 in 1569. The President was an English Military Governor, based in Athlone, whose job it was to enforce English authority, taxes and culture in return for recognising the English titles of designated Irish lords. In return, the local chieftains were supposed to give up their private armed forces, except for a small band of personal retainers. This was known as the \u2018Composition of Connacht\u2019. In 1588 the Lord President was Richard Bingham. [6] The \u2018Presidency\u2019 was often brutal and generally unpopular, but was not universally resisted. The composition of Connacht was the imposition of English style land-holding on the province overseen by a military governor. The Presidency worked to the advantage of the two biggest Lords in Connacht \u2013 O\u2019Brien of Thomond (in modern Clare, then considered part of Connacht) and Burke of Clanricard (in modern south and east Galway), whose leading families kept a firm grip on succession and who consolidated their power over their dependent clans with English backing. Elsewhere though, the English presence provoked serious violence. The MacWilliam Burkes of north Mayo, for instance revolted after the English attempted to back an unpopular candidate for chieftain in 1585. In the same year, in a scheme known as the Composition of Connacht, Irish titles were abolished and English settlers were introduced into the province, mainly on confiscated monastic land. The MacWilliams, joined by other discontented chieftains such as Brian O\u2019Rourke in Leitrim, fought English forces led by President Richard Bingham throughout 1586. Only after the slaughter of 800 Scottish gallowglass soldiers they had brought in did they, for the time being, submit. [7] So in 1588, when the Spaniards ended up off the coast of Ireland, they may have expected to find a sympathetic Catholic population ready to help them. What actually existed however was a highly fragmented political scene, in which the loyalties of individual lords depended not so much on ideology as on their immediate relationship to English power. But the Spaniards, of course, never expected to arrive on Ireland\u2019s west coast in 1588. Spain was no stranger to naval warfare or to seaborne invasions. Sixteen years before the attack on England, at the battle of Lepanto 1571, a Spanish-led Catholic fleet \u2013the \u2018Holy League\u2019 \u2013 had crushed the fleet of the Ottoman Turks, hitherto the dominant naval power in the eastern Mediterranean. And just six years previously in 1582, Phillip\u2019s forces had successfully mounted an amphibious invasion of the Azores islands, the only Portuguese possession to resist the \u2018Union of Crowns\u2019 with Spain by force. [8] While the invasion of England \u2013 an Atlantic power with formidable maritime expertise \u2013 was a challenge of a different order, it was clear that the Spanish threat to England was real. Initial Spanish plans included a diversionary landing in Waterford but this was later dropped Initially, Spanish strategists came up with a plan for a three pronged attack on England in 1586-87. Interestingly, this included a landing at Waterford, in south eastern Ireland in order to draw off English resources from the main assault over the English Channel. The Spanish fleet was to draw off its English counterpart as it went to deal with the Irish landing, and meanwhile the Spanish Army of Flanders was to cross the English Chanel unopposed. [9] All had to be postponed however after the English naval commander Francis Drake launched a devastating attack on the Spanish port of Cadiz in 1587, destroying many ships and much of their stores. The following year the Spaniards came up with a simpler plan. The \u2018Invincible Armada\u2019 \u2013 a fleet of 130 warships and supply ships, led by Duke Medina Sidonia \u2013 was to sail from Lisbon via Corunna, link up with the Army of Flanders, led by Allessando Farnese, the Duke of Parma. This force, 37,000 soldiers strong, was waiting at Calais to be escorted in a further 260 transport barges across the Channel onto the English coast. [10] Had the Army of Flanders made it across the English channel there is little doubt there would have been \u2018regime change\u2019 in Protestant England. There is little doubt that, had the Army of Flanders crossed into England, the veteran Spanish troops would have swept aside the raw English militias that Elizabeth could put into the field. In that event, Elizabeth was to be deposed and Parma was to act as interim military ruler until the Pope and Phillip II named a new, Catholic monarch. [11] Elizabeth herself created a legend by addressing her troops at Tilbury in Essex, assembled (incidentally nowhere near the where the Spaniards intended to land) with the immortal words, I know I have the body of a weak, feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma [12] or Spain [13] , or any prince of Europe, should dare to invade the borders of my realm; to which rather than any dishonour shall grow by me, I myself will take up arms, I myself will be your general, judge, and rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field. [14] Stirring words no doubt, but in reality everything, for the English depended on stopping the Spaniards from crossing the channel. In this they had some advantages. Their fleet may have been smaller than the Armada, but in terms of well armed warships, suitable for northern seas the English may even have had the edge. The operation was at the very limits of what the Spanish Empire was able to accomplish. Some ships had had to be hijacked in Spanish ports and pressed into service for the invasion. Many others were Mediterranean vessels, unsuited for the wild seas of the Atlantic. Some cannon had been hurriedly cast and burst when fired. Most importantly of all, Spanish logistics were insufficient. Not enough food or water was supplied and some of it was begin to spoil by the time the great Armada set sail from Corunna. Many sailors got sick and supplies were perilously low by the time they reached English waters. [15] Sea battle was joined from July to late August 1588 as the Armada fought its way towards the coast of Flanders. It culminated in fierce encounter off the Gravellines, or the coast of the Spanish Netherlands (modern Belgium), with the English attempting desperately to break up the Armada and to prevent it from reaching its rendezvous with the Army of Flanders. The English under Admiral Howard succeeded in breaking up the Spanish formation by use of \u2018fire-ships\u2019, vessels set alight with pitch and tar and sent towards the Spanish fleet. In the fighting that followed, superior English gunnery managed to bloody the Spaniards somewhat and to keep them away from the Duke of Parma\u2019s army at the disembarkation point at Calais. Superior English gunnery prevented the Armada from linking up with its land forces but it was the weather and lack of supplies that defeated it. However, this was a tactical defeat for the Armada, not a catastrophe \u2013 only 5 ships were lost, though many others were damaged. Medina Sidonia, in command of the Armada had other problems however. Logistics had always been insufficient and now food and water supplies were beginning to run out altogether. Moreover, a \u2018Protestant Wind (southerly and westerly), in early September forced the Spanish to head for home, north around the coast of Scotland and Ireland back to Corunna. This turned out to be a far more costly enterprise than the battle itself. As the Armada rounded the northern Irish coast, it was in dire need of re-provision of both food and water. For this reason the fleet had to approach the unfamiliar coast of Ireland. There it was hit by westerly gales and crashed into the rocky Atlantic coast. In all 24 ships and c.5-7000 men lost off Ireland, mostly by drowning. All sailing ships were, to a degree, at the mercy of the weather, the Armada, many of whose vessels were built for the much calmer Mediterranean, was more vulnerable than most. The Annals of the Four Masters recorded; Great numbers of the Spaniards were drowned, and their ships were totally wrecked in those places. The smaller part of them returned to Spain; and some say that nine thousand of them were lost on this occasion. [16] Those who made it ashore generally fared little better than those lost at sea. The Armada lost far more ships and men wrecked off Ireland than it battle with the English fleet. The English Lord Deputy of Ireland, Fitzwilliam, issued a proclamation whereby \u2018Harbouring Castaways\u2019 was punishable by death. To his own officers he wrote; \u2018Whereas the distressed fleet of the Spaniards by tempest and contrary winds, though the providence of God have been driven on the coast\u2026 where it is thought, great treasure and also ordinance, munitions [and] armour hath been cast. We authorize you to\u2026 to haul all hulls and to apprehend and execute all Spaniards found there of any quality soever. Torture May be used in prosecuting this inquiry.\u2019 [17] This chilling order, not to spare prisoners \u2018of any quality [i.e. rank or social status] whatsoever\u2019 was startlingly ruthless. Accordingly Richard Bingham, the President of Connacht, and his brother George Bingham, executed up to 1,100 Spanish survivors of the wrecks who made it ashore in the western province. For instance, at Galway city, 300 Spanish prisoners including 40 aristocrats were beheaded on Fitzwilliam\u2019s orders \u2013 though Bingham apparently regretted the loss of ransom money. Only a handful such as Don Luis de Cordoba, managed to secretly buy their way to safety. [18] English treatment of Spanish prisoners in Ireland was ruthless, almost all were killed. Native Irish treatment of the Spanish survivors was extremely varied. In Connacht, most Irish lords cooperated with Bingham, particularly the largest lords O\u2019Brien, Earl of Thomond, and Burke, Earl of Clanricarde. Other clans such as the O\u2019Flahertys also handed over Spanish prisoners. Others, seem simply to have seen the Armada as an opportunity for personal gain. Dubhdarach O\u2019Malley Roe, on Clare Island, for instance killed the Spanish survivors and kept their gold for himself. Elsewhere, at Streedagh in modern County Sligo for instance, where four ships were lost, the locals robbed the Spaniards of any valuables they could find, but did not kill them. However, in modern north Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim, areas which had very recently been in armed revolt against the English Crown \u2013 chieftains such as MacWilliam Burke, and Brian O\u2019Rourke harboured Spaniards. [19] Though some Irish lords sheltered the Spaniards, it seems the majority either looted them or handed them over to the English. A rather ungrateful captain, Francisco de Cuellar, who was taken in by O\u2019Rourke, wrote of \u2018passing seven months among mountains and woods with savages\u2019. Cuellar was shipwrecked on Streedagh beach, Sligo, spoke first of the \u2018savages\u2019 stripping and looting his ship, and the \u2018English Lutherans\u2019 hanging or cutting off the heads of his comrades wherever they captured them. O\u2019Rourke, whom he described as \u2018a savage but a very good Christian and an enemy of the heretics, always carrying on war with them\u2019, sent him through the territory of several other friendly clans including the McClancys and the O\u2019Cahans to Derry, from where he secretly took ship back to the Spanish Netherlands. [20] Although Cuellar reported that the Catholic Irish, with whom he conversed in Latin, repeatedly asked for a Spanish invasion, the Irish Annals were clear that, apart from O\u2019Rourke and his allies, most of the Irish had sided with the Crown; A great army was mustered by the Lord Justice of Ireland, Sir William Fitzwilliam; Sir Richard Bingham, Governor of the province of Connaught; and Sir Thomas Norris, Governor of the two provinces of Munster; together with the most of the men of Ireland\u2026 except the people of Ulster, the O\u2019Rourke and Mac Sweeny-na-dTuath, who had formed friendship and alliance with some of the Spanish fleet which we have before mentioned. These forces spoiled every thing to which they came in their course, not belonging to the Queen\u2019s people, from the Suck to the Drowes, and from the Drowes to the Finn. [21] In Ulster, which was still largely outside of English control, the Spaniards seem to have fared somewhat better, at least if they survived shipwreck. In Antrim the Scottish/Irish MacDonnell clan led by Sorley Boy (Somhairle Buidh) helped up to 500 Spaniards escape to Scotland. [22] . The position of Hugh O\u2019Neill, Earl of Tyrone, the most powerful northern leader, at this point still proclaiming himself a loyal subject to Elizabeth I, was hard to pin down. He sheltered and kept on a number of Spanish commanders to train his own forces, whom he was soon to lead in a war against the Elizabethan state. [23] Nevertheless, he also reported to Fitzwilliam the Lord Deputy that he had \u2018put a large number of Spaniards to the sword\u2019 in Inishowen (modern Donegal). [24] Ironically enough, those Spaniards lucky enough to be shipwrecked in England itself were generally treated much more leniently. Most were taken prisoner and eventually repatriated. Ireland, where English authority was tenuous enough for them feel that extreme ruthlessness was a necessity, was the real grave of the \u2018Invincible Armada\u2019. The defeat of the Armada, as much by bad weather, poor planning and bad luck as by battle, seemed a providential escape to English Protestants \u2013 literally gift sent by God. Nevertheless, war between England and Spain continued indecisively until 1604 \u2013 an \u2018English Armada\u2019, sent to destroy the port at Corruna 1589 was itself defeated with 40 ships sunk and 10,000 men lost. In Ireland itself the immediate effects of the Armada are hard to gauge. The frantic military activity all over the west destabilized the always fragile political situation there. North Connacht rose in rebellion again in 1589, though again, mainly over local grievances. Brian O\u2019Rourke who had harboured many Spaniards fled to Scotland but was handed over the English and hanged. Certainly however, those areas, principally in the north, who had helped the wrecked Spaniards in 1588, helped to forge an enduring connection between Catholic Ireland and Catholic Spain. During Hugh O\u2019Neill and Hugh O\u2019Donnell\u2019s Nine Years War (1595-1603) against the English Crown, both lords were in constant communication with Phillip II, who aided them with weapons, money and finally a l anding of Spanish troops at Kinsale in 1601-2. Despite the fate of the Armada in Ireland, the late 16th century saw a strong bond created between Irish Catholics and the Spanish monarchy, through mutual hostility to Protestant England. None of this should obscure the reality however that in the year of the Armada, the Irish weather and probably the majority of the Irish concerned helped to seal the fate of Spanish Armada.

The Ohio River supports 160 species of fish. There are 20 locks and dams on the Ohio River for flood control and navigation. There are 38 power-generating facilities on the Ohio River. The river\u2019s deepest point is 168 feet (51 m) on the western side of Louisville Kentucky. From Louisville, the river l oses depth very gradually until its confluence with the Mississippi at Cairo Illinois where it has an approximate depth of 19 feet (6 m) . Velocities or how fast the water moves on the Ohio River can range from 0.1 mph under low flow to 5 mph at flood stage Read about this popular American river right here at MyWaterEarth&Sky-The Schuylkill River is pronounced SKOOL-kil, locally a river running northwest to southeast in eastern Pennsylvania which means \u201chidden river,\u201d was named by Dutch settlers who discovered the river\u2019s mouth \u2026\u2026\u2026..

long river in the United States .", "It is located at the boundary of the Midwestern and Southern United States , flowing in a southwesterly direction from western Pennsylvania to its mouth on the Mississippi River at the southern tip of Illinois .", "It is the third largest river by discharge volume in the United States and the largest tributary by volume of the north-south flowing Mississippi River that divides the eastern from western United States.", "[2]", "It is also the 6th oldest river on the North American continent.", "The river flows through or along the border of six states , and its drainage basin includes parts of 14 states.", "Through its largest tributary, the Tennessee River , the basin includes several states of the southeastern U.S.", "It is the source of drinking water for five million people.", "[3]\nThe lower Ohio River just below Louisville is obstructed by rapids known as the Falls of the Ohio where the elevation falls 26 feet (7.9 m) in 2 miles (3.2 km) restricting larger commercial navigation, although in the 18th and early 19th century its three deepest channels could be traversed by a wide variety of craft then in use.", "In 1830, the Louisville and Portland Canal (now the McAlpine Locks and Dam ) bypassed the rapids, allowing even larger commercial and modern navigation from the Forks of the Ohio at Pittsburgh to the Port of New Orleans at the mouth of the Mississippi on the Gulf of Mexico.", "\nThe name \"Ohio\" comes from the Seneca , Ohi:yo' , lit.", "\"Good River\".", "[4] In his Notes on the State of Virginia published in 1781\u201382, Thomas Jefferson stated: \"The Ohio is the most beautiful river on earth.", "Its current gentle, waters clear, and bosom smooth and unbroken by rocks and rapids, a single instance only excepted\" (though Jefferson himself had not seen the Ohio)", "[5]", "In the late 18th century, the river was the southern boundary of the Northwest Territory .", "It became a primary transportation route for pioneers during the westward expansion of the early U.S. Today, the Ohio River is one of the most polluted rivers in the United States.", "\nThe river is sometimes considered as the western extension of the Mason\u2013Dixon Line that divided Pennsylvania from Maryland , and thus part of the border between free and slave territory, and between the Northern and Southern United States or Upper South .", "Where the river was narrow, it was crossed by thousands of slaves escaping to the North for freedom; many were helped by free blacks and whites of the Underground Railroad resistance movement.", "\nThe Ohio River is a climatic transition area, as its water runs along the periphery of the humid subtropical and humid continental climate areas.", "It is inhabited by fauna and flora of both climates.", "In winter, it regularly freezes over at Pittsburgh but rarely farther south toward Cincinnati and Louisville .", "Further down the river in places like Paducah and Owensboro , Kentucky, closer to its confluence with the Mississippi, the Ohio is ice-free year-round.", "\nThe name \"Ohio\" comes from the Seneca language (an Iroquoian language ), Ohi:yo' (roughly pronounced oh-hee-yoh, with the vowel in \"hee\" held longer ), a proper name derived from ohi\u02d0yo\u02d0h (\"good river\"), therefore literally translating to \"Good River\".", "[4] [6] \"Great river\" and \"large creek\" have also been given as translations.", "[7] [8]\nNative Americans, including the Lenni Lenape and Iroquois , considered the Ohio and Allegheny rivers as the same, as is suggested by a New York State road sign on Interstate 86 that refers to the Allegheny River also as Ohi:yo' .", "[9] Similarly, the Geographic Names Information System lists O-hee-yo and O-hi-o as variant names for the Allegheny.", "[10]\nAn earlier Miami-Illinois language name was also applied to the Ohio River, Mosopeleacipi (\"river of the Mosopelea \" tribe).", "Shortened in the Shawnee language to pelewa thiipi , spelewathiipi or peleewa thiipiiki , the name evolved through variant forms such as \"Polesipi\", \"Peleson\", \"Pele Sipi\" and \"Pere Sipi\", and eventually stabilized to the variant spellings \"Pelisipi\", \"Pelisippi\" and \"Pellissippi\".", "Originally applied just to the Ohio River, the \"Pelisipi\" name later was variously applied back and forth between the Ohio River and the Clinch River in Virginia and Tennessee .", "[11] [12]", "In his original draft of the Land Ordinance of 1784 , Thomas Jefferson proposed a new state called \"Pelisipia\", to the south of the Ohio River, which would have included parts of present-day Eastern Kentucky , Virginia and West Virginia .", "[11]\nThe river had great significance in the history of the Native Americans , as numerous prehistoric and historic civilizations formed along its valley.", "[13] For thousands of years, Native Americans used the river as a major transportation and trading route.", "[14] Its waters connected communities.", "\nIn the five centuries before European colonization, the Mississippian culture built numerous regional chiefdoms and major earthwork mounds in the Ohio Valley like the Angel Mounds near Evansville, Indiana as well as in the Mississippi Valley and the Southeast.", "The historic Osage , Omaha , Ponca , and Kaw peoples lived in the Ohio Valley.", "Under pressure over the fur trade from the Iroquois nations to the northeast, they migrated west of the Mississippi River in the 17th century to the territory now defined as Missouri , Arkansas , and Oklahoma .", "\nSeveral accounts exist of the discovery and traversal of the Ohio River by Europeans in the latter half of the 17th century: Virginian colonist Abraham Wood 's trans-Appalachian expeditions between 1654 and

(1,579 km) long river in the United States . It is located at the boundary of the Midwestern and Southern United States , flowing in a southwesterly direction from western Pennsylvania to its mouth on the Mississippi River at the southern tip of Illinois . It is the third largest river by discharge volume in the United States and the largest tributary by volume of the north-south flowing Mississippi River that divides the eastern from western United States. [2] It is also the 6th oldest river on the North American continent. The river flows through or along the border of six states , and its drainage basin includes parts of 14 states. Through its largest tributary, the Tennessee River , the basin includes several states of the southeastern U.S. It is the source of drinking water for five million people. [3]\nThe lower Ohio River just below Louisville is obstructed by rapids known as the Falls of the Ohio where the elevation falls 26 feet (7.9 m) in 2 miles (3.2 km) restricting larger commercial navigation, although in the 18th and early 19th century its three deepest channels could be traversed by a wide variety of craft then in use. In 1830, the Louisville and Portland Canal (now the McAlpine Locks and Dam ) bypassed the rapids, allowing even larger commercial and modern navigation from the Forks of the Ohio at Pittsburgh to the Port of New Orleans at the mouth of the Mississippi on the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe name \"Ohio\" comes from the Seneca , Ohi:yo' , lit. \"Good River\". [4] In his Notes on the State of Virginia published in 1781\u201382, Thomas Jefferson stated: \"The Ohio is the most beautiful river on earth. Its current gentle, waters clear, and bosom smooth and unbroken by rocks and rapids, a single instance only excepted\" (though Jefferson himself had not seen the Ohio) [5] In the late 18th century, the river was the southern boundary of the Northwest Territory . It became a primary transportation route for pioneers during the westward expansion of the early U.S. Today, the Ohio River is one of the most polluted rivers in the United States.\nThe river is sometimes considered as the western extension of the Mason\u2013Dixon Line that divided Pennsylvania from Maryland , and thus part of the border between free and slave territory, and between the Northern and Southern United States or Upper South . Where the river was narrow, it was crossed by thousands of slaves escaping to the North for freedom; many were helped by free blacks and whites of the Underground Railroad resistance movement.\nThe Ohio River is a climatic transition area, as its water runs along the periphery of the humid subtropical and humid continental climate areas. It is inhabited by fauna and flora of both climates. In winter, it regularly freezes over at Pittsburgh but rarely farther south toward Cincinnati and Louisville . Further down the river in places like Paducah and Owensboro , Kentucky, closer to its confluence with the Mississippi, the Ohio is ice-free year-round.\nThe name \"Ohio\" comes from the Seneca language (an Iroquoian language ), Ohi:yo' (roughly pronounced oh-hee-yoh, with the vowel in \"hee\" held longer ), a proper name derived from ohi\u02d0yo\u02d0h (\"good river\"), therefore literally translating to \"Good River\". [4] [6] \"Great river\" and \"large creek\" have also been given as translations. [7] [8]\nNative Americans, including the Lenni Lenape and Iroquois , considered the Ohio and Allegheny rivers as the same, as is suggested by a New York State road sign on Interstate 86 that refers to the Allegheny River also as Ohi:yo' . [9] Similarly, the Geographic Names Information System lists O-hee-yo and O-hi-o as variant names for the Allegheny. [10]\nAn earlier Miami-Illinois language name was also applied to the Ohio River, Mosopeleacipi (\"river of the Mosopelea \" tribe). Shortened in the Shawnee language to pelewa thiipi , spelewathiipi or peleewa thiipiiki , the name evolved through variant forms such as \"Polesipi\", \"Peleson\", \"Pele Sipi\" and \"Pere Sipi\", and eventually stabilized to the variant spellings \"Pelisipi\", \"Pelisippi\" and \"Pellissippi\". Originally applied just to the Ohio River, the \"Pelisipi\" name later was variously applied back and forth between the Ohio River and the Clinch River in Virginia and Tennessee . [11] [12] In his original draft of the Land Ordinance of 1784 , Thomas Jefferson proposed a new state called \"Pelisipia\", to the south of the Ohio River, which would have included parts of present-day Eastern Kentucky , Virginia and West Virginia . [11]\nThe river had great significance in the history of the Native Americans , as numerous prehistoric and historic civilizations formed along its valley. [13] For thousands of years, Native Americans used the river as a major transportation and trading route. [14] Its waters connected communities.\nIn the five centuries before European colonization, the Mississippian culture built numerous regional chiefdoms and major earthwork mounds in the Ohio Valley like the Angel Mounds near Evansville, Indiana as well as in the Mississippi Valley and the Southeast. The historic Osage , Omaha , Ponca , and Kaw peoples lived in the Ohio Valley. Under pressure over the fur trade from the Iroquois nations to the northeast, they migrated west of the Mississippi River in the 17th century to the territory now defined as Missouri , Arkansas , and Oklahoma .\nSeveral accounts exist of the discovery and traversal of the Ohio River by Europeans in the latter half of the 17th century: Virginian colonist Abraham Wood 's trans-Appalachian expeditions between 1654 and 1664; [15] Frenchman Robert de La Salle 's putative Ohio expedition of 1669; [16] and two expeditions of Virginians sponsored by Colonel Wood: the Batts and Fallam expedition of 1671, [17] and the Needham and Arthur expedition of 1673-74. [18] [19] The first known European to traverse the length of the river, from the headwaters of the Allegheny to its mouth on the Mississippi, was a Dutchman from New York, Arnout Viele , in 1692. [20] [21]\nIn 1749, the Ohio Company was established in the Thirteen Colonies to settle and trade in the Ohio River region. Exploration of the territory and trade with the Indians in the region near the Forks brought white colonists from both Pennsylvania and Virginia across the mountains, and both colonies claimed the territory. The movement across the Allegheny Mountains of Anglo-American settlers and the claims of the area near modern-day Pittsburgh led to conflict with the French, who had forts in the Ohio River Valley . This conflict was called the French and Indian War , and would merge into the global Anglo-French struggle, the Seven Years' War . In 1763, following its defeat in the war, France ceded its area east of the Mississippi River to Britain and its area west of the Mississippi River to Spain in the 1763 Treaty of Paris .\nThe 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix with several tribes opened Kentucky to colonial settlement and established the Ohio River as a southern boundary for American Indian territory. [22] In 1774 the Quebec Act restored the land east of the Mississippi River and north of the Ohio River to Quebec , in effect making the Ohio the southern boundary of Canada . This appeased French Canadians in Quebec but angered the colonists of the Thirteen Colonies . Lord Dunmore's War south of the Ohio river also contributed to cession of land north to Quebec to prevent colonial expansion onto Native American territory. During the Revolutionary War . in 1776 the British military engineer John Montr\u00e9sor created a map of the river showing the strategic location of Fort Pitt , including specific navigational information about the Ohio River's rapids and tributaries in that area. [23] However, the 1783 Treaty of Paris gave the entire Ohio Valley to the United States , and numerous white settlers entered the region.\nThe economic connection of the Ohio Country to the East was significantly increased in 1818 when the National Road being built westward from Cumberland, Maryland , reached Wheeling, Virginia , (now West Virginia ), providing an easier overland connection from the Potomac River to the Ohio River. [24] The Wheeling Suspension Bridge was built over the river at Wheeling from 1847 to 1849, making the trip west easier. For a brief time, until 1851, it was the world's largest suspension bridge. The bridge survived the American Civil War , after having been improved in 1859. It was renovated again in 1872, and remains in use as the oldest vehicular suspension bridge in the U.S.\nLouisville was founded in 1779 at the only major natural navigational barrier on the river, the Falls of the Ohio . The Falls were a series of rapids where the river dropped 26 feet (7.9 m) in a stretch of about 2 miles (3.2 km). In this area, the river flowed over hard, fossil-rich beds of limestone . The first locks on the river \u2013 the Louisville and Portland Canal \u2013 were built between 1825 and 1830 to circumnavigate the falls. Fears that Louisville's transshipment industry would collapse proved ill-founded: but the increasing size of steamships and barges on the river meant that the outdated locks could serve only the smallest vessels until well after the Civil War when improvements were made. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers improvements were expanded again in the 1960s, forming the present-day McAlpine Locks and Dam .\nDuring the nineteenth century, emigrants from Virginia, North Carolina and Kentucky traveled by the river and settled along its northern bank. Known as butternuts , they formed the dominant culture in the southern portions of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois with a society that was primarily Southern in culture. Largely devoted to agricultural pursuits, they shipped much of their produce along the river to ports such as Cincinnati. [25]\nBecause the Ohio River flowed westward, it became a convenient means of westward movement by pioneers traveling from western Pennsylvania. After reaching the mouth of the Ohio, settlers would travel north on the Mississippi River to St. Louis, Missouri . There, some continued on up the Missouri River , some up the Mississippi, and some farther west over land routes. In the early 19th century, river pirates such as Samuel Mason , operating out of Cave-In-Rock, Illinois , waylaid travelers on their way down the river. They killed travelers, stealing their goods and scuttling their boats. The folktales about Mike Fink recall the keelboats used for commerce in the early days of American settlement. The Ohio River boatmen inspired performer Dan Emmett , who in 1843 wrote the song \" The Boatman's Dance \".\nTrading boats and ships traveled south on the Mississippi to New Orleans , and sometimes beyond to the Gulf of Mexico and other ports in the Americas and Europe. This provided a much-needed export route for goods from the west since the trek east over the Appalachian Mountains was long and arduous. The need for access to the port of New Orleans by settlers in the Ohio Valley is one of the factors that led to the United States' Louisiana Purchase in 1803.\nBecause the river is the southern border of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, it was part of the border between free states and slave states in the years before the American Civil War . The expression \"sold down the river\" originated as a lament of Upper South slaves, especially from Kentucky, who were shipped via the Ohio and Mississippi to cotton and sugar plantations in the Deep South . Changes in crops cultivated in the Upper South resulted in slaves available to be sold to the South, where the expansion of cotton plantations was doing very well. Invention of the cotton gin made cultivation of short-staple cotton profitable throughout the Black Belt of this region. [26] [27]\nBefore and during the Civil War, the Ohio River was called the \" River Jordan \" by slaves crossing it to escape to freedom in the North via the Underground Railroad . [28] More escaping slaves, estimated in the thousands, made their perilous journey north to freedom across the Ohio River than anywhere else across the north-south frontier. Harriet Beecher Stowe 's Uncle Tom's Cabin , the bestselling novel that fueled abolitionist work, was the best known of the anti-slavery novels that portrayed such escapes across the Ohio. The times have been expressed by 20th-century novelists as well, such as the Nobel Prize -winning Toni Morrison , whose novel Beloved was adapted as a film of the same name. She also composed the libretto for the opera Margaret Garner (2005), based on the life and trial of an enslaved woman who escaped with her family across the river.\nThe colonial charter for Virginia defined its territory as extending to the north shore of the Ohio, so that the riverbed was \"owned\" by Virginia. Where the river serves as a boundary between states today, Congress designated the entire river to belong to the states on the east and south, i.e., West Virginia and Kentucky at the time of admission to the Union, that were divided from Virginia. Thus Wheeling Island , the largest inhabited island in the Ohio River, belongs to West Virginia, although it is closer to the Ohio shore than to the West Virginia shore. Kentucky sued the state of Indiana in the early 1980s because of their construction of the never-completed Marble Hill Nuclear Power Plant in Indiana, which would have discharged its waste water into the river. This would have adversely affected Kentucky's water supplies.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court held that Kentucky's jurisdiction (and, implicitly, that of West Virginia) extended only to the low-water mark of 1793 (important because the river has been extensively dammed for navigation so that the present river bank is north of the old low-water mark.) Similarly, in the 1990s, Kentucky challenged Illinois's right to collect taxes on a riverboat casino docked in Metropolis , citing its own control of the entire river. A private casino riverboat that docked in Evansville, Indiana , on the Ohio River opened about the same time. Although such boats cruised on the Ohio River in an oval pattern up and down, the state of Kentucky soon protested. Other states had to limit their cruises to going forward, then reversing and going backward on the Indiana shore only. Both Illinois and Indiana have long since changed their laws to allow riverboat casinos to be permanently docked, with Illinois changing in 1999 and Indiana in 2002.\nThe Silver Bridge at Point Pleasant, West Virginia collapsed into the river on December 15, 1967. The collapse killed 46 people who had been crossing when the bridge failed. The bridge had been built in 1929, and by 1967 was carrying too heavy a load for its design. [29] The bridge was rebuilt about one mile downstream and in service as the Silver Memorial Bridge in 1969.\nThe Ohio River as a whole is ranked as the most polluted river in the United States, based on 2009 and 2010 data. The more industrial and regional West Virginia/Pennsylvania tributary, the Monongahela River , ranked 17th for water pollution , behind 16 other American rivers. [30] The Ohio again ranked as the most polluted in 2013, and has been the most polluted river since at least 2001, according to the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission (ORSANCO). The Commission found that 92% of toxic discharges were nitrates , including farm runoff and waste water from industrial processes such as steel production. The Commission also noted mercury pollution as an ongoing concern, citing a 500% increase in mercury discharges between 2007 and 2013. [31]\nFor several decades beginning in the 1950s, the Ohio River was polluted with hundreds of thousands of pounds of PFOA , a fluoride-based chemical used in making teflon , among other things, by the DuPont chemical company from an outflow pipe at its Parkersburg, West Virginia , facility. [32]\nThe Ohio River is extensively industrialized and populated. Regular barge traffic carries cargoes of oil, steel and other industrial goods produced in the region. Major cities located along the northern and southern banks of the river include Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania ; Louisville, Kentucky ; Evansville, Indiana ; and Cincinnati, Ohio . [14]\nThe combined Allegheny-Ohio river is 1,310 miles (2,110 km) long and carries the largest volume of water of any tributary of the Mississippi. The Indians and early European explorers and settlers of the region often considered the Allegheny to be part of the Ohio. The forks (the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers at what is now Pittsburgh) were considered a strategic military location by colonial French and British, and later independent American military authorities.\nThe Ohio River is formed by the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers at what is now Point State Park in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . From there, it flows northwest through Allegheny and Beaver counties, before making an abrupt turn to the south-southwest at the West Virginia \u2013Ohio\u2013Pennsylvania triple-state line (near East Liverpool, Ohio ; Chester, West Virginia ; and Ohioville, Pennsylvania ). From there, it forms the border between West Virginia and Ohio, upstream of Wheeling, West Virginia .\nThe river follows a roughly southwest and then west-northwest course until Cincinnati, before bending to a west-southwest course for most of the remainder of its length. The course forms the northern borders of West Virginia and Kentucky ; and the southern borders of Ohio , Indiana and Illinois , until it joins the Mississippi River at the city of Cairo, Illinois . Where the Ohio joins the Mississippi is the lowest elevation in the state of Illinois, at 315 feet (96 m).\nThe Mississippi River flows to the Gulf of Mexico on the Atlantic Ocean . Among rivers wholly or mostly in the United States, the Ohio is the second largest by discharge volume and the tenth longest and has the eighth largest drainage basin. It serves to separate the Midwestern Great Lakes states from the Upper South states, which were historically border states in the Civil War.\nThe Ohio River is a left (east) and the largest tributary by volume of the Mississippi River in the United States . At the confluence , the Ohio is considerably bigger than the Mississippi, measured by long-term mean discharge. The Ohio River at Cairo is 281,500 cu ft/s (7,960 m 3 /s); [1] and the Mississippi River at Thebes, Illinois , which is upstream of the confluence, is 208,200 cu ft/s (5,897 m 3 /s). [33] The Ohio River flow is greater than that of the Mississippi River, so hydrologically the Ohio River is the main stream of the river system.\nThe Ohio River is a naturally shallow river that was artificially deepened by a series of dams . The natural depth of the river varied from about 3 to 20 feet (1 to 6 m). The dams raise the water level and have turned the river largely into a series of reservoirs , eliminating shallow stretches and allowing for commercial navigation. From its origin to Cincinnati, the average depth is approximately 15 feet (5 m). The largest immediate drop in water level is below the McAlpine Locks and Dam at the Falls of the Ohio at Louisville, Kentucky , where flood stage is reached when the water reaches 23 feet (7 m) on the lower gauge. However, the river's deepest point is 168 feet (51 m) on the western side of Louisville, Kentucky. From Louisville, the river loses depth very gradually until its confluence with the Mississippi at Cairo, Illinois , where it has an approximate depth of 19 feet (6 m).\nWater levels for the Ohio River from Smithland Lock and Dam upstream to Pittsburgh are predicted daily by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Ohio River Forecast Center. [34] The water depth predictions are relative to each local flood plain based upon predicted rainfall in the Ohio River basin in five reports as follows:\nThe water levels for the Ohio River from Smithland Lock and Dam to Cairo, Illinois, are predicted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Lower Mississippi River Forecast Center.

It is located at the boundary of the Midwestern and Southern United States , flowing in a southwesterly direction from western Pennsylvania to its mouth on the Mississippi River at the southern tip of Illinois . It is the third largest river by discharge volume in the United States and the largest tributary by volume of the north-south flowing Mississippi River that divides the eastern from western United States. [2] It is also the 6th oldest river on the North American continent. The river flows through or along the border of six states , and its drainage basin includes parts of 14 states. Through its largest tributary, the Tennessee River , the basin includes several states of the southeastern U.S. It is the source of drinking water for five million people. [3] The lower Ohio River just below Louisville is obstructed by rapids known as the Falls of the Ohio where the elevation falls 26 feet (7.9 m) in 2 miles (3.2 km) restricting larger commercial navigation, although in the 18th and early 19th century its three deepest channels could be traversed by a wide variety of craft then in use. In 1830, the Louisville and Portland Canal (now the McAlpine Locks and Dam ) bypassed the rapids, allowing even larger commercial and modern navigation from the Forks of the Ohio at Pittsburgh to the Port of New Orleans at the mouth of the Mississippi on the Gulf of Mexico. The name \"Ohio\" comes from the Seneca , Ohi:yo' , lit. \"Good River\". [4] In his Notes on the State of Virginia published in 1781\u201382, Thomas Jefferson stated: \"The Ohio is the most beautiful river on earth. Its current gentle, waters clear, and bosom smooth and unbroken by rocks and rapids, a single instance only excepted\" (though Jefferson himself had not seen the Ohio) [5] In the late 18th century, the river was the southern boundary of the Northwest Territory . It became a primary transportation route for pioneers during the westward expansion of the early U.S. Today, the Ohio River is one of the most polluted rivers in the United States. The river is sometimes considered as the western extension of the Mason\u2013Dixon Line that divided Pennsylvania from Maryland , and thus part of the border between free and slave territory, and between the Northern and Southern United States or Upper South . Where the river was narrow, it was crossed by thousands of slaves escaping to the North for freedom; many were helped by free blacks and whites of the Underground Railroad resistance movement. The Ohio River is a climatic transition area, as its water runs along the periphery of the humid subtropical and humid continental climate areas. It is inhabited by fauna and flora of both climates. In winter, it regularly freezes over at Pittsburgh but rarely farther south toward Cincinnati and Louisville . Further down the river in places like Paducah and Owensboro , Kentucky, closer to its confluence with the Mississippi, the Ohio is ice-free year-round. The name \"Ohio\" comes from the Seneca language (an Iroquoian language ), Ohi:yo' (roughly pronounced oh-hee-yoh, with the vowel in \"hee\" held longer ), a proper name derived from ohi\u02d0yo\u02d0h (\"good river\"), therefore literally translating to \"Good River\". [4] [6] \"Great river\" and \"large creek\" have also been given as translations. [7] [8] Native Americans, including the Lenni Lenape and Iroquois , considered the Ohio and Allegheny rivers as the same, as is suggested by a New York State road sign on Interstate 86 that refers to the Allegheny River also as Ohi:yo' . [9] Similarly, the Geographic Names Information System lists O-hee-yo and O-hi-o as variant names for the Allegheny. [10] An earlier Miami-Illinois language name was also applied to the Ohio River, Mosopeleacipi (\"river of the Mosopelea \" tribe). Shortened in the Shawnee language to pelewa thiipi , spelewathiipi or peleewa thiipiiki , the name evolved through variant forms such as \"Polesipi\", \"Peleson\", \"Pele Sipi\" and \"Pere Sipi\", and eventually stabilized to the variant spellings \"Pelisipi\", \"Pelisippi\" and \"Pellissippi\". Originally applied just to the Ohio River, the \"Pelisipi\" name later was variously applied back and forth between the Ohio River and the Clinch River in Virginia and Tennessee . [11] [12] In his original draft of the Land Ordinance of 1784 , Thomas Jefferson proposed a new state called \"Pelisipia\", to the south of the Ohio River, which would have included parts of present-day Eastern Kentucky , Virginia and West Virginia . [11] The river had great significance in the history of the Native Americans , as numerous prehistoric and historic civilizations formed along its valley. [13] For thousands of years, Native Americans used the river as a major transportation and trading route. [14] Its waters connected communities. In the five centuries before European colonization, the Mississippian culture built numerous regional chiefdoms and major earthwork mounds in the Ohio Valley like the Angel Mounds near Evansville, Indiana as well as in the Mississippi Valley and the Southeast. The historic Osage , Omaha , Ponca , and Kaw peoples lived in the Ohio Valley. Under pressure over the fur trade from the Iroquois nations to the northeast, they migrated west of the Mississippi River in the 17th century to the territory now defined as Missouri , Arkansas , and Oklahoma . Several accounts exist of the discovery and traversal of the Ohio River by Europeans in the latter half of the 17th century: Virginian colonist Abraham Wood 's trans-Appalachian expeditions between 1654 and 1664; [15] Frenchman Robert de La Salle 's putative Ohio expedition of 1669; [16] and two expeditions of Virginians sponsored by Colonel Wood: the Batts and Fallam expedition of 1671, [17] and the Needham and Arthur expedition of 1673-74. [18] [19] The first known European to traverse the length of the river, from the headwaters of the Allegheny to its mouth on the Mississippi, was a Dutchman from New York, Arnout Viele , in 1692. [20] [21] In 1749, the Ohio Company was established in the Thirteen Colonies to settle and trade in the Ohio River region. Exploration of the territory and trade with the Indians in the region near the Forks brought white colonists from both Pennsylvania and Virginia across the mountains, and both colonies claimed the territory. The movement across the Allegheny Mountains of Anglo-American settlers and the claims of the area near modern-day Pittsburgh led to conflict with the French, who had forts in the Ohio River Valley . This conflict was called the French and Indian War , and would merge into the global Anglo-French struggle, the Seven Years' War . In 1763, following its defeat in the war, France ceded its area east of the Mississippi River to Britain and its area west of the Mississippi River to Spain in the 1763 Treaty of Paris . The 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix with several tribes opened Kentucky to colonial settlement and established the Ohio River as a southern boundary for American Indian territory. [22] In 1774 the Quebec Act restored the land east of the Mississippi River and north of the Ohio River to Quebec , in effect making the Ohio the southern boundary of Canada . This appeased French Canadians in Quebec but angered the colonists of the Thirteen Colonies . Lord Dunmore's War south of the Ohio river also contributed to cession of land north to Quebec to prevent colonial expansion onto Native American territory. During the Revolutionary War . in 1776 the British military engineer John Montr\u00e9sor created a map of the river showing the strategic location of Fort Pitt , including specific navigational information about the Ohio River's rapids and tributaries in that area. [23] However, the 1783 Treaty of Paris gave the entire Ohio Valley to the United States , and numerous white settlers entered the region. The economic connection of the Ohio Country to the East was significantly increased in 1818 when the National Road being built westward from Cumberland, Maryland , reached Wheeling, Virginia , (now West Virginia ), providing an easier overland connection from the Potomac River to the Ohio River. [24] The Wheeling Suspension Bridge was built over the river at Wheeling from 1847 to 1849, making the trip west easier. For a brief time, until 1851, it was the world's largest suspension bridge. The bridge survived the American Civil War , after having been improved in 1859. It was renovated again in 1872, and remains in use as the oldest vehicular suspension bridge in the U.S. Louisville was founded in 1779 at the only major natural navigational barrier on the river, the Falls of the Ohio . The Falls were a series of rapids where the river dropped 26 feet (7.9 m) in a stretch of about 2 miles (3.2 km). In this area, the river flowed over hard, fossil-rich beds of limestone . The first locks on the river \u2013 the Louisville and Portland Canal \u2013 were built between 1825 and 1830 to circumnavigate the falls. Fears that Louisville's transshipment industry would collapse proved ill-founded: but the increasing size of steamships and barges on the river meant that the outdated locks could serve only the smallest vessels until well after the Civil War when improvements were made. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers improvements were expanded again in the 1960s, forming the present-day McAlpine Locks and Dam . During the nineteenth century, emigrants from Virginia, North Carolina and Kentucky traveled by the river and settled along its northern bank. Known as butternuts , they formed the dominant culture in the southern portions of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois with a society that was primarily Southern in culture. Largely devoted to agricultural pursuits, they shipped much of their produce along the river to ports such as Cincinnati. [25] Because the Ohio River flowed westward, it became a convenient means of westward movement by pioneers traveling from western Pennsylvania. After reaching the mouth of the Ohio, settlers would travel north on the Mississippi River to St. Louis, Missouri . There, some continued on up the Missouri River , some up the Mississippi, and some farther west over land routes. In the early 19th century, river pirates such as Samuel Mason , operating out of Cave-In-Rock, Illinois , waylaid travelers on their way down the river. They killed travelers, stealing their goods and scuttling their boats. The folktales about Mike Fink recall the keelboats used for commerce in the early days of American settlement. The Ohio River boatmen inspired performer Dan Emmett , who in 1843 wrote the song \" The Boatman's Dance \". Trading boats and ships traveled south on the Mississippi to New Orleans , and sometimes beyond to the Gulf of Mexico and other ports in the Americas and Europe. This provided a much-needed export route for goods from the west since the trek east over the Appalachian Mountains was long and arduous. The need for access to the port of New Orleans by settlers in the Ohio Valley is one of the factors that led to the United States' Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Because the river is the southern border of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, it was part of the border between free states and slave states in the years before the American Civil War . The expression \"sold down the river\" originated as a lament of Upper South slaves, especially from Kentucky, who were shipped via the Ohio and Mississippi to cotton and sugar plantations in the Deep South . Changes in crops cultivated in the Upper South resulted in slaves available to be sold to the South, where the expansion of cotton plantations was doing very well. Invention of the cotton gin made cultivation of short-staple cotton profitable throughout the Black Belt of this region. [26] [27] Before and during the Civil War, the Ohio River was called the \" River Jordan \" by slaves crossing it to escape to freedom in the North via the Underground Railroad . [28] More escaping slaves, estimated in the thousands, made their perilous journey north to freedom across the Ohio River than anywhere else across the north-south frontier. Harriet Beecher Stowe 's Uncle Tom's Cabin , the bestselling novel that fueled abolitionist work, was the best known of the anti-slavery novels that portrayed such escapes across the Ohio. The times have been expressed by 20th-century novelists as well, such as the Nobel Prize -winning Toni Morrison , whose novel Beloved was adapted as a film of the same name. She also composed the libretto for the opera Margaret Garner (2005), based on the life and trial of an enslaved woman who escaped with her family across the river. The colonial charter for Virginia defined its territory as extending to the north shore of the Ohio, so that the riverbed was \"owned\" by Virginia. Where the river serves as a boundary between states today, Congress designated the entire river to belong to the states on the east and south, i.e., West Virginia and Kentucky at the time of admission to the Union, that were divided from Virginia. Thus Wheeling Island , the largest inhabited island in the Ohio River, belongs to West Virginia, although it is closer to the Ohio shore than to the West Virginia shore. Kentucky sued the state of Indiana in the early 1980s because of their construction of the never-completed Marble Hill Nuclear Power Plant in Indiana, which would have discharged its waste water into the river. This would have adversely affected Kentucky's water supplies. The U.S. Supreme Court held that Kentucky's jurisdiction (and, implicitly, that of West Virginia) extended only to the low-water mark of 1793 (important because the river has been extensively dammed for navigation so that the present river bank is north of the old low-water mark.)

The Ohio River begins at Point State Park in Pittsburgh, PA, and flows 981 miles to its ending point in Cairo, Illinois. The Ohio drainage basin spreads across 14 states and spans 205,000 square miles. Beyond being home to the main ports of Cincinnati, Louisville, and Pittsburgh, the Ohio River is a significant transportation route for the states through which it courses. The Ohio River flows across six states, and its basin spreads over 14 different states. As with most waterways, this one also supports many cities and a thriving commercial shipping industry that contributes significantly to the states\u2019 economies through which the river flows. Besides this, the Ohio River sustains a vast selection of wildlife, with some animals on endangered and protected lists. So, if the Ohio River and its tributaries flow across 14 states, where does the Ohio River start? The Ohio River is one of the major rivers in the United States. It flows over 981 miles from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Cairo, Illinois, where it meets the Mississippi River. This historic river has played a significant role in the development of the region and continues to be an important resource today. With that said, here are some cool facts about the Ohio River: The Ohio River consists of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Ohio River flows through the borders of six different states: Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. The Ohio River is the source of drinking water for over five million people in many different areas. More than 25 million people live along the Ohio River Basin. There are actually 20 dams on the Ohio River. The headwaters of the Ohio River are at the confluence of the Allegheny and the Monongahela Rivers at Point State Park in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Ohio River then flows for 981 miles and ends in Cairo, Illinois. The Ohio River ends by flowing into the Mississippi River and is one of its many tributaries. The Ohio River passes through six U.S. states in total. Do you wonder what it would look like on a map? Here\u2019s a glimpse of it below. Zooming in will make it more detectable, but check out the meandering dotted line that travels southwest from Cincinnati for an idea. After forming at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers, the Ohio River flows through the Allegheny and Beaver counties. Next, it courses through the West Virginia\u2013Ohio\u2013Pennsylvania triple-state line before forming the border between West Virginia and Ohio. At this point, it flows until it reaches Cincinnati and eventually forms the border of West Virginia and Kentucky. Its path also includes the borders of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Finally, the Ohio River ends and empties into the Mississippi River in Cairo, Illinois. The Ohio River begins in Pennsylvania and eventually ends in Illinois. The other four states in which the river flows are: Indiana Kentucky Ohio West Virginia The Ohio River\u2019s drainage basin spans 205,000 square miles. Despite the river only crossing six states, its basin spreads across 14 states. In reality, the river basin covers roughly 5% of the U.S. mainland, including many of the southeastern states and eastern sections of the Mississippi basin. The 14 states that the Ohio River basin covers include: Illinois Indiana Ohio New York Pennsylvania Maryland West Virginia Kentucky Tennessee Virginia North Carolina Georgia Alabama Mississippi Although Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina lie to the east of the Appalachian Mountains Continental Divide, the Ohio River basin still makes small inroads into these states. Notably, a small strip on the western border along the Youghiogheny River enters Maryland. The Ohio River basin covers much of southwest Virginia and the western part of North Carolina. The average width of the Ohio River is narrow at about half a mile, but its widest point reaches roughly one mile. This point is at the Smithland Dam in Kentucky. Also, the Ohio River\u2019s depth varies, with many parts differing due to human intervention in the form of dam construction. On average, though, the Ohio River\u2019s depth is 24 feet, with the deepest point of the river being 168 feet near Louisville, Kentucky. This Louisville area is also where many large shipping vessels travel up and down the Ohio River. Just as the Ohio River starts in a specific area, it also gives life and leads to the spouting of many major cities near its banks. Many of these major cities include: Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania Cincinnati in Ohio Louisville in Kentucky Evansville in Indiana Huntington in West Virginia Cincinnati, Louisville, and Pittsburgh are home to the main ports of the river. Also, because the Ohio River is almost 1,000 miles long, it is a significant transportation route for the states through which it courses. Besides, the Ohio River has a stable flow of water and only has one major obstacle, the Falls of Ohio close to Louisville. As a result, authorities have built locks at the falls, controlling the descent and navigation of ships past the falls for commerce. Other than the falls, there are 13 dams and locks along the river, ensuring the smooth travel of vessels for longer distances. Ships transport coal, oil, steel, gravel, petroleum products, and manufactured goods up and down the Ohio River. Fishing is a popular activity on the Ohio River. Anglers catch a selection of fish like largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, rock bass, black bass, white bass, striped bass, sauger, walleye, blue catfish, channel catfish, and flathead catfish. Bass are common in creeks during the spring and in deeper water during the summer. Sauger and walleye live in the tailwater areas during the spring, fall, and winter and in streams during the summer. Catfish are another species that make the Ohio River their home. The Ohio River is where various endangered animals and wildlife live. Several endangered birds you can spot along the Ohio River include the Kirtland\u2019s warblers and piping plover. An endangered fish that you can find in the Ohio River is the Scioto madtom. The Ohio River is also home to threatened marine life like club shell mussels, fan shell mussels, northern rifle shell mussels, and the pink mucket pearly mussel. Mussels live throughout the Ohio River, with 45 different species of native freshwater mussels making this river their breeding grounds. These shellfish filter the river\u2019s water and reduce silt, sediment, and pollutants in the river\u2019s water as they feed.

its drainage basin includes parts of 14 states.", "Through its largest tributary, the Tennessee River , the basin includes several states of the southeastern U.S.", "It is the source of drinking water for five million people.", "[3]\nThe lower Ohio River just below Louisville is obstructed by rapids known as the Falls of the Ohio where the elevation falls 26 feet (7.9 m) in 2 miles (3.2 km) restricting larger commercial navigation, although in the 18th and early 19th century its three deepest channels could be traversed by a wide variety of craft then in use.", "In 1830, the Louisville

excepted\" (though Jefferson himself had not seen the Ohio)", "[5]", "In the late 18th century, the river was the southern boundary of the Northwest Territory .", "It became a primary transportation route for pioneers during the westward expansion of the early U.S. Today, the Ohio River is one of the most polluted rivers in the United States.", "\nThe river is sometimes considered as the western extension of the Mason\u2013Dixon Line that divided Pennsylvania from Maryland , and thus part of the border between free and slave territory, and between the Northern and Southern United States or Upper South .", "Where the river was narrow, it was crossed by thousands of slaves escaping to the North for freedom; many were helped by free blacks and whites of the Underground Railroad resistance movement.", "\nThe Ohio River is a climatic transition area, as its water runs along the periphery of the humid subtropical and humid continental climate areas.", "It is inhabited by fauna and flora of both climates.", "In winter, it regularly freezes over at Pittsburgh but rarely farther south toward Cincinnati and Louisville .", "Further down the river in places like Paducah and Owensboro , Kentucky, closer to its confluence with the Mississippi, the Ohio is ice-free year-round.", "\nThe name \"Ohio\" comes from the Seneca language (an Iroquoian language ), Ohi:yo' (roughly pronounced

(1,579 km) long river in the United States . It is located at the boundary of the Midwestern and Southern United States , flowing in a southwesterly direction from western Pennsylvania to its mouth on the Mississippi River at the southern tip of Illinois . It is the third largest river by discharge volume in the United States and the largest tributary by volume of the north-south flowing Mississippi River that divides the eastern from western United States. [2] It is also the 6th oldest river on the North American continent. The river flows through or along the border of six states , and its drainage basin includes parts of 14 states. Through its largest tributary, the Tennessee River , the basin includes several states of the southeastern U.S. It is the source of drinking water for five million people. [3]\nThe lower Ohio River just below Louisville is obstructed by rapids known as the Falls of the Ohio where the elevation falls 26 feet (7.9 m) in 2 miles (3.2 km) restricting larger commercial navigation, although in the 18th and early 19th century its three deepest channels could be traversed by a wide variety of craft then in use. In 1830, the Louisville and Portland Canal (now the McAlpine Locks and Dam ) bypassed the rapids, allowing even larger commercial and modern navigation from the Forks of the Ohio at Pittsburgh to the Port of New Orleans at the mouth of the Mississippi on the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe name \"Ohio\" comes from the Seneca , Ohi:yo' , lit. \"Good River\". [4] In his Notes on the State of Virginia published in 1781\u201382, Thomas Jefferson stated: \"The Ohio is the most beautiful river on earth. Its current gentle, waters clear, and bosom smooth and unbroken by rocks and rapids, a single instance only excepted\" (though Jefferson himself had not seen the Ohio) [5] In the late 18th century, the river was the southern boundary of the Northwest Territory . It became a primary transportation route for pioneers during the westward expansion of the early U.S. Today, the Ohio River is one of the most polluted rivers in the United States.\nThe river is sometimes considered as the western extension of the Mason\u2013Dixon Line that divided Pennsylvania from Maryland , and thus part of the border between free and slave territory, and between the Northern and Southern United States or Upper South . Where the river was narrow, it was crossed by thousands of slaves escaping to the North for freedom; many were helped by free blacks and whites of the Underground Railroad resistance movement.\nThe Ohio River is a climatic transition area, as its water runs along the periphery of the humid subtropical and humid continental climate areas. It is inhabited by fauna and flora of both climates. In winter, it regularly freezes over at Pittsburgh but rarely farther south toward Cincinnati and Louisville . Further down the river in places like Paducah and Owensboro , Kentucky, closer to its confluence with the Mississippi, the Ohio is ice-free year-round.\nThe name \"Ohio\" comes from the Seneca language (an Iroquoian language ), Ohi:yo' (roughly pronounced oh-hee-yoh, with the vowel in \"hee\" held longer ), a proper name derived from ohi\u02d0yo\u02d0h (\"good river\"), therefore literally translating to \"Good River\". [4] [6] \"Great river\" and \"large creek\" have also been given as translations. [7] [8]\nNative Americans, including the Lenni Lenape and Iroquois , considered the Ohio and Allegheny rivers as the same, as is suggested by a New York State road sign on Interstate 86 that refers to the Allegheny River also as Ohi:yo' . [9] Similarly, the Geographic Names Information System lists O-hee-yo and O-hi-o as variant names for the Allegheny. [10]\nAn earlier Miami-Illinois language name was also applied to the Ohio River, Mosopeleacipi (\"river of the Mosopelea \" tribe). Shortened in the Shawnee language to pelewa thiipi , spelewathiipi or peleewa thiipiiki , the name evolved through variant forms such as \"Polesipi\", \"Peleson\", \"Pele Sipi\" and \"Pere Sipi\", and eventually stabilized to the variant spellings \"Pelisipi\", \"Pelisippi\" and \"Pellissippi\". Originally applied just to the Ohio River, the \"Pelisipi\" name later was variously applied back and forth between the Ohio River and the Clinch River in Virginia and Tennessee . [11] [12] In his original draft of the Land Ordinance of 1784 , Thomas Jefferson proposed a new state called \"Pelisipia\", to the south of the Ohio River, which would have included parts of present-day Eastern Kentucky , Virginia and West Virginia . [11]\nThe river had great significance in the history of the Native Americans , as numerous prehistoric and historic civilizations formed along its valley. [13] For thousands of years, Native Americans used the river as a major transportation and trading route. [14] Its waters connected communities.\nIn the five centuries before European colonization, the Mississippian culture built numerous regional chiefdoms and major earthwork mounds in the Ohio Valley like the Angel Mounds near Evansville, Indiana as well as in the Mississippi Valley and the Southeast. The historic Osage , Omaha , Ponca , and Kaw peoples lived in the Ohio Valley. Under pressure over the fur trade from the Iroquois nations to the northeast, they migrated west of the Mississippi River in the 17th century to the territory now defined as Missouri , Arkansas , and Oklahoma .\nSeveral accounts exist of the discovery and traversal of the Ohio River by Europeans in the latter half of the 17th century: Virginian colonist Abraham Wood 's trans-Appalachian expeditions between 1654 and 1664; [15] Frenchman Robert de La Salle 's putative Ohio expedition of 1669; [16] and two expeditions of Virginians sponsored by Colonel Wood: the Batts and Fallam expedition of 1671, [17] and the Needham and Arthur expedition of 1673-74. [18] [19] The first known European to traverse the length of the river, from the headwaters of the Allegheny to its mouth on the Mississippi, was a Dutchman from New York, Arnout Viele , in 1692. [20] [21]\nIn 1749, the Ohio Company was established in the Thirteen Colonies to settle and trade in the Ohio River region. Exploration of the territory and trade with the Indians in the region near the Forks brought white colonists from both Pennsylvania and Virginia across the mountains, and both colonies claimed the territory. The movement across the Allegheny Mountains of Anglo-American settlers and the claims of the area near modern-day Pittsburgh led to conflict with the French, who had forts in the Ohio River Valley . This conflict was called the French and Indian War , and would merge into the global Anglo-French struggle, the Seven Years' War . In 1763, following its defeat in the war, France ceded its area east of the Mississippi River to Britain and its area west of the Mississippi River to Spain in the 1763 Treaty of Paris .\nThe 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix with several tribes opened Kentucky to colonial settlement and established the Ohio River as a southern boundary for American Indian territory. [22] In 1774 the Quebec Act restored the land east of the Mississippi River and north of the Ohio River to Quebec , in effect making the Ohio the southern boundary of Canada . This appeased French Canadians in Quebec but angered the colonists of the Thirteen Colonies . Lord Dunmore's War south of the Ohio river also contributed to cession of land north to Quebec to prevent colonial expansion onto Native American territory. During the Revolutionary War . in 1776 the British military engineer John Montr\u00e9sor created a map of the river showing the strategic location of Fort Pitt , including specific navigational information about the Ohio River's rapids and tributaries in that area. [23] However, the 1783 Treaty of Paris gave the entire Ohio Valley to the United States , and numerous white settlers entered the region.\nThe economic connection of the Ohio Country to the East was significantly increased in 1818 when the National Road being built westward from Cumberland, Maryland , reached Wheeling, Virginia , (now West Virginia ), providing an easier overland connection from the Potomac River to the Ohio River. [24] The Wheeling Suspension Bridge was built over the river at Wheeling from 1847 to 1849, making the trip west easier. For a brief time, until 1851, it was the world's largest suspension bridge. The bridge survived the American Civil War , after having been improved in 1859. It was renovated again in 1872, and remains in use as the oldest vehicular suspension bridge in the U.S.\nLouisville was founded in 1779 at the only major natural navigational barrier on the river, the Falls of the Ohio . The Falls were a series of rapids where the river dropped 26 feet (7.9 m) in a stretch of about 2 miles (3.2 km). In this area, the river flowed over hard, fossil-rich beds of limestone . The first locks on the river \u2013 the Louisville and Portland Canal \u2013 were built between 1825 and 1830 to circumnavigate the falls. Fears that Louisville's transshipment industry would collapse proved ill-founded: but the increasing size of steamships and barges on the river meant that the outdated locks could serve only the smallest vessels until well after the Civil War when improvements were made. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers improvements were expanded again in the 1960s, forming the present-day McAlpine Locks and Dam .\nDuring the nineteenth century, emigrants from Virginia, North Carolina and Kentucky traveled by the river and settled along its northern bank. Known as butternuts , they formed the dominant culture in the southern portions of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois with a society that was primarily Southern in culture. Largely devoted to agricultural pursuits, they shipped much of their produce along the river to ports such as Cincinnati. [25]\nBecause the Ohio River flowed westward, it became a convenient means of westward movement by pioneers traveling from western Pennsylvania. After reaching the mouth of the Ohio, settlers would travel north on the Mississippi River to St. Louis, Missouri . There, some continued on up the Missouri River , some up the Mississippi, and some farther west over land routes. In the early 19th century, river pirates such as Samuel Mason , operating out of Cave-In-Rock, Illinois , waylaid travelers on their way down the river. They killed travelers, stealing their goods and scuttling their boats. The folktales about Mike Fink recall the keelboats used for commerce in the early days of American settlement. The Ohio River boatmen inspired performer Dan Emmett , who in 1843 wrote the song \" The Boatman's Dance \".\nTrading boats and ships traveled south on the Mississippi to New Orleans , and sometimes beyond to the Gulf of Mexico and other ports in the Americas and Europe. This provided a much-needed export route for goods from the west since the trek east over the Appalachian Mountains was long and arduous. The need for access to the port of New Orleans by settlers in the Ohio Valley is one of the factors that led to the United States' Louisiana Purchase in 1803.\nBecause the river is the southern border of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, it was part of the border between free states and slave states in the years before the American Civil War . The expression \"sold down the river\" originated as a lament of Upper South slaves, especially from Kentucky, who were shipped via the Ohio and Mississippi to cotton and sugar plantations in the Deep South . Changes in crops cultivated in the Upper South resulted in slaves available to be sold to the South, where the expansion of cotton plantations was doing very well. Invention of the cotton gin made cultivation of short-staple cotton profitable throughout the Black Belt of this region. [26] [27]\nBefore and during the Civil War, the Ohio River was called the \" River Jordan \" by slaves crossing it to escape to freedom in the North via the Underground Railroad . [28] More escaping slaves, estimated in the thousands, made their perilous journey north to freedom across the Ohio River than anywhere else across the north-south frontier. Harriet Beecher Stowe 's Uncle Tom's Cabin , the bestselling novel that fueled abolitionist work, was the best known of the anti-slavery novels that portrayed such escapes across the Ohio. The times have been expressed by 20th-century novelists as well, such as the Nobel Prize -winning Toni Morrison , whose novel Beloved was adapted as a film of the same name. She also composed the libretto for the opera Margaret Garner (2005), based on the life and trial of an enslaved woman who escaped with her family across the river.\nThe colonial charter for Virginia defined its territory as extending to the north shore of the Ohio, so that the riverbed was \"owned\" by Virginia. Where the river serves as a boundary between states today, Congress designated the entire river to belong to the states on the east and south, i.e., West Virginia and Kentucky at the time of admission to the Union, that were divided from Virginia. Thus Wheeling Island , the largest inhabited island in the Ohio River, belongs to West Virginia, although it is closer to the Ohio shore than to the West Virginia shore. Kentucky sued the state of Indiana in the early 1980s because of their construction of the never-completed Marble Hill Nuclear Power Plant in Indiana, which would have discharged its waste water into the river. This would have adversely affected Kentucky's water supplies.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court held that Kentucky's jurisdiction (and, implicitly, that of West Virginia) extended only to the low-water mark of 1793 (important because the river has been extensively dammed for navigation so that the present river bank is north of the old low-water mark.) Similarly, in the 1990s, Kentucky challenged Illinois's right to collect taxes on a riverboat casino docked in Metropolis , citing its own control of the entire river. A private casino riverboat that docked in Evansville, Indiana , on the Ohio River opened about the same time. Although such boats cruised on the Ohio River in an oval pattern up and down, the state of Kentucky soon protested. Other states had to limit their cruises to going forward, then reversing and going backward on the Indiana shore only. Both Illinois and Indiana have long since changed their laws to allow riverboat casinos to be permanently docked, with Illinois changing in 1999 and Indiana in 2002.\nThe Silver Bridge at Point Pleasant, West Virginia collapsed into the river on December 15, 1967. The collapse killed 46 people who had been crossing when the bridge failed. The bridge had been built in 1929, and by 1967 was carrying too heavy a load for its design. [29] The bridge was rebuilt about one mile downstream and in service as the Silver Memorial Bridge in 1969.\nThe Ohio River as a whole is ranked as the most polluted river in the United States, based on 2009 and 2010 data. The more industrial and regional West Virginia/Pennsylvania tributary, the Monongahela River , ranked 17th for water pollution , behind 16 other American rivers. [30] The Ohio again ranked as the most polluted in 2013, and has been the most polluted river since at least 2001, according to the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission (ORSANCO). The Commission found that 92% of toxic discharges were nitrates , including farm runoff and waste water from industrial processes such as steel production. The Commission also noted mercury pollution as an ongoing concern, citing a 500% increase in mercury discharges between 2007 and 2013. [31]\nFor several decades beginning in the 1950s, the Ohio River was polluted with hundreds of thousands of pounds of PFOA , a fluoride-based chemical used in making teflon , among other things, by the DuPont chemical company from an outflow pipe at its Parkersburg, West Virginia , facility. [32]\nThe Ohio River is extensively industrialized and populated. Regular barge traffic carries cargoes of oil, steel and other industrial goods produced in the region. Major cities located along the northern and southern banks of the river include Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania ; Louisville, Kentucky ; Evansville, Indiana ; and Cincinnati, Ohio . [14]\nThe combined Allegheny-Ohio river is 1,310 miles (2,110 km) long and carries the largest volume of water of any tributary of the Mississippi. The Indians and early European explorers and settlers of the region often considered the Allegheny to be part of the Ohio. The forks (the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers at what is now Pittsburgh) were considered a strategic military location by colonial French and British, and later independent American military authorities.\nThe Ohio River is formed by the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers at what is now Point State Park in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . From there, it flows northwest through Allegheny and Beaver counties, before making an abrupt turn to the south-southwest at the West Virginia \u2013Ohio\u2013Pennsylvania triple-state line (near East Liverpool, Ohio ; Chester, West Virginia ; and Ohioville, Pennsylvania ). From there, it forms the border between West Virginia and Ohio, upstream of Wheeling, West Virginia .\nThe river follows a roughly southwest and then west-northwest course until Cincinnati, before bending to a west-southwest course for most of the remainder of its length. The course forms the northern borders of West Virginia and Kentucky ; and the southern borders of Ohio , Indiana and Illinois , until it joins the Mississippi River at the city of Cairo, Illinois . Where the Ohio joins the Mississippi is the lowest elevation in the state of Illinois, at 315 feet (96 m).\nThe Mississippi River flows to the Gulf of Mexico on the Atlantic Ocean . Among rivers wholly or mostly in the United States, the Ohio is the second largest by discharge volume and the tenth longest and has the eighth largest drainage basin. It serves to separate the Midwestern Great Lakes states from the Upper South states, which were historically border states in the Civil War.\nThe Ohio River is a left (east) and the largest tributary by volume of the Mississippi River in the United States . At the confluence , the Ohio is considerably bigger than the Mississippi, measured by long-term mean discharge. The Ohio River at Cairo is 281,500 cu ft/s (7,960 m 3 /s); [1] and the Mississippi River at Thebes, Illinois , which is upstream of the confluence, is 208,200 cu ft/s (5,897 m 3 /s). [33] The Ohio River flow is greater than that of the Mississippi River, so hydrologically the Ohio River is the main stream of the river system.\nThe Ohio River is a naturally shallow river that was artificially deepened by a series of dams . The natural depth of the river varied from about 3 to 20 feet (1 to 6 m). The dams raise the water level and have turned the river largely into a series of reservoirs , eliminating shallow stretches and allowing for commercial navigation. From its origin to Cincinnati, the average depth is approximately 15 feet (5 m). The largest immediate drop in water level is below the McAlpine Locks and Dam at the Falls of the Ohio at Louisville, Kentucky , where flood stage is reached when the water reaches 23 feet (7 m) on the lower gauge. However, the river's deepest point is 168 feet (51 m) on the western side of Louisville, Kentucky. From Louisville, the river loses depth very gradually until its confluence with the Mississippi at Cairo, Illinois , where it has an approximate depth of 19 feet (6 m).\nWater levels for the Ohio River from Smithland Lock and Dam upstream to Pittsburgh are predicted daily by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Ohio River Forecast Center. [34] The water depth predictions are relative to each local flood plain based upon predicted rainfall in the Ohio River basin in five reports as follows:\nThe water levels for the Ohio River from Smithland Lock and Dam to Cairo, Illinois, are predicted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Lower Mississippi River Forecast Center.

Its current gentle, waters clear, and bosom smooth and unbroken by rocks and rapids, a single instance only excepted\" (though Jefferson himself had not seen the Ohio) [5] In the late 18th century, the river was the southern boundary of the Northwest Territory . It became a primary transportation route for pioneers during the westward expansion of the early U.S. Today, the Ohio River is one of the most polluted rivers in the United States. The river is sometimes considered as the western extension of the Mason\u2013Dixon Line that divided Pennsylvania from Maryland , and thus part of the border between free and slave territory, and between the Northern and Southern United States or Upper South . Where the river was narrow, it was crossed by thousands of slaves escaping to the North for freedom; many were helped by free blacks and whites of the Underground Railroad resistance movement. The Ohio River is a climatic transition area, as its water runs along the periphery of the humid subtropical and humid continental climate areas. It is inhabited by fauna and flora of both climates. In winter, it regularly freezes over at Pittsburgh but rarely farther south toward Cincinnati and Louisville . Further down the river in places like Paducah and Owensboro , Kentucky, closer to its confluence with the Mississippi, the Ohio is ice-free year-round. The name \"Ohio\" comes from the Seneca language (an Iroquoian language ), Ohi:yo' (roughly pronounced oh-hee-yoh, with the vowel in \"hee\" held longer ), a proper name derived from ohi\u02d0yo\u02d0h (\"good river\"), therefore literally translating to \"Good River\". [4] [6] \"Great river\" and \"large creek\" have also been given as translations. [7] [8] Native Americans, including the Lenni Lenape and Iroquois , considered the Ohio and Allegheny rivers as the same, as is suggested by a New York State road sign on Interstate 86 that refers to the Allegheny River also as Ohi:yo' . [9] Similarly, the Geographic Names Information System lists O-hee-yo and O-hi-o as variant names for the Allegheny. [10] An earlier Miami-Illinois language name was also applied to the Ohio River, Mosopeleacipi (\"river of the Mosopelea \" tribe). Shortened in the Shawnee language to pelewa thiipi , spelewathiipi or peleewa thiipiiki , the name evolved through variant forms such as \"Polesipi\", \"Peleson\", \"Pele Sipi\" and \"Pere Sipi\", and eventually stabilized to the variant spellings \"Pelisipi\", \"Pelisippi\" and \"Pellissippi\". Originally applied just to the Ohio River, the \"Pelisipi\" name later was variously applied back and forth between the Ohio River and the Clinch River in Virginia and Tennessee . [11] [12] In his original draft of the Land Ordinance of 1784 , Thomas Jefferson proposed a new state called \"Pelisipia\", to the south of the Ohio River, which would have included parts of present-day Eastern Kentucky , Virginia and West Virginia . [11] The river had great significance in the history of the Native Americans , as numerous prehistoric and historic civilizations formed along its valley. [13] For thousands of years, Native Americans used the river as a major transportation and trading route. [14] Its waters connected communities. In the five centuries before European colonization, the Mississippian culture built numerous regional chiefdoms and major earthwork mounds in the Ohio Valley like the Angel Mounds near Evansville, Indiana as well as in the Mississippi Valley and the Southeast. The historic Osage , Omaha , Ponca , and Kaw peoples lived in the Ohio Valley. Under pressure over the fur trade from the Iroquois nations to the northeast, they migrated west of the Mississippi River in the 17th century to the territory now defined as Missouri , Arkansas , and Oklahoma . Several accounts exist of the discovery and traversal of the Ohio River by Europeans in the latter half of the 17th century: Virginian colonist Abraham Wood 's trans-Appalachian expeditions between 1654 and 1664; [15] Frenchman Robert de La Salle 's putative Ohio expedition of 1669; [16] and two expeditions of Virginians sponsored by Colonel Wood: the Batts and Fallam expedition of 1671, [17] and the Needham and Arthur expedition of 1673-74. [18] [19] The first known European to traverse the length of the river, from the headwaters of the Allegheny to its mouth on the Mississippi, was a Dutchman from New York, Arnout Viele , in 1692. [20] [21] In 1749, the Ohio Company was established in the Thirteen Colonies to settle and trade in the Ohio River region. Exploration of the territory and trade with the Indians in the region near the Forks brought white colonists from both Pennsylvania and Virginia across the mountains, and both colonies claimed the territory. The movement across the Allegheny Mountains of Anglo-American settlers and the claims of the area near modern-day Pittsburgh led to conflict with the French, who had forts in the Ohio River Valley . This conflict was called the French and Indian War , and would merge into the global Anglo-French struggle, the Seven Years' War . In 1763, following its defeat in the war, France ceded its area east of the Mississippi River to Britain and its area west of the Mississippi River to Spain in the 1763 Treaty of Paris . The 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix with several tribes opened Kentucky to colonial settlement and established the Ohio River as a southern boundary for American Indian territory. [22] In 1774 the Quebec Act restored the land east of the Mississippi River and north of the Ohio River to Quebec , in effect making the Ohio the southern boundary of Canada . This appeased French Canadians in Quebec but angered the colonists of the Thirteen Colonies . Lord Dunmore's War south of the Ohio river also contributed to cession of land north to Quebec to prevent colonial expansion onto Native American territory. During the Revolutionary War . in 1776 the British military engineer John Montr\u00e9sor created a map of the river showing the strategic location of Fort Pitt , including specific navigational information about the Ohio River's rapids and tributaries in that area. [23] However, the 1783 Treaty of Paris gave the entire Ohio Valley to the United States , and numerous white settlers entered the region. The economic connection of the Ohio Country to the East was significantly increased in 1818 when the National Road being built westward from Cumberland, Maryland , reached Wheeling, Virginia , (now West Virginia ), providing an easier overland connection from the Potomac River to the Ohio River. [24] The Wheeling Suspension Bridge was built over the river at Wheeling from 1847 to 1849, making the trip west easier. For a brief time, until 1851, it was the world's largest suspension bridge. The bridge survived the American Civil War , after having been improved in 1859. It was renovated again in 1872, and remains in use as the oldest vehicular suspension bridge in the U.S. Louisville was founded in 1779 at the only major natural navigational barrier on the river, the Falls of the Ohio . The Falls were a series of rapids where the river dropped 26 feet (7.9 m) in a stretch of about 2 miles (3.2 km). In this area, the river flowed over hard, fossil-rich beds of limestone . The first locks on the river \u2013 the Louisville and Portland Canal \u2013 were built between 1825 and 1830 to circumnavigate the falls. Fears that Louisville's transshipment industry would collapse proved ill-founded: but the increasing size of steamships and barges on the river meant that the outdated locks could serve only the smallest vessels until well after the Civil War when improvements were made. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers improvements were expanded again in the 1960s, forming the present-day McAlpine Locks and Dam . During the nineteenth century, emigrants from Virginia, North Carolina and Kentucky traveled by the river and settled along its northern bank. Known as butternuts , they formed the dominant culture in the southern portions of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois with a society that was primarily Southern in culture. Largely devoted to agricultural pursuits, they shipped much of their produce along the river to ports such as Cincinnati. [25] Because the Ohio River flowed westward, it became a convenient means of westward movement by pioneers traveling from western Pennsylvania. After reaching the mouth of the Ohio, settlers would travel north on the Mississippi River to St. Louis, Missouri . There, some continued on up the Missouri River , some up the Mississippi, and some farther west over land routes. In the early 19th century, river pirates such as Samuel Mason , operating out of Cave-In-Rock, Illinois , waylaid travelers on their way down the river. They killed travelers, stealing their goods and scuttling their boats. The folktales about Mike Fink recall the keelboats used for commerce in the early days of American settlement. The Ohio River boatmen inspired performer Dan Emmett , who in 1843 wrote the song \" The Boatman's Dance \". Trading boats and ships traveled south on the Mississippi to New Orleans , and sometimes beyond to the Gulf of Mexico and other ports in the Americas and Europe. This provided a much-needed export route for goods from the west since the trek east over the Appalachian Mountains was long and arduous. The need for access to the port of New Orleans by settlers in the Ohio Valley is one of the factors that led to the United States' Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Because the river is the southern border of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, it was part of the border between free states and slave states in the years before the American Civil War . The expression \"sold down the river\" originated as a lament of Upper South slaves, especially from Kentucky, who were shipped via the Ohio and Mississippi to cotton and sugar plantations in the Deep South . Changes in crops cultivated in the Upper South resulted in slaves available to be sold to the South, where the expansion of cotton plantations was doing very well. Invention of the cotton gin made cultivation of short-staple cotton profitable throughout the Black Belt of this region. [26] [27] Before and during the Civil War, the Ohio River was called the \" River Jordan \" by slaves crossing it to escape to freedom in the North via the Underground Railroad . [28] More escaping slaves, estimated in the thousands, made their perilous journey north to freedom across the Ohio River than anywhere else across the north-south frontier. Harriet Beecher Stowe 's Uncle Tom's Cabin , the bestselling novel that fueled abolitionist work, was the best known of the anti-slavery novels that portrayed such escapes across the Ohio. The times have been expressed by 20th-century novelists as well, such as the Nobel Prize -winning Toni Morrison , whose novel Beloved was adapted as a film of the same name. She also composed the libretto for the opera Margaret Garner (2005), based on the life and trial of an enslaved woman who escaped with her family across the river. The colonial charter for Virginia defined its territory as extending to the north shore of the Ohio, so that the riverbed was \"owned\" by Virginia. Where the river serves as a boundary between states today, Congress designated the entire river to belong to the states on the east and south, i.e., West Virginia and Kentucky at the time of admission to the Union, that were divided from Virginia. Thus Wheeling Island , the largest inhabited island in the Ohio River, belongs to West Virginia, although it is closer to the Ohio shore than to the West Virginia shore. Kentucky sued the state of Indiana in the early 1980s because of their construction of the never-completed Marble Hill Nuclear Power Plant in Indiana, which would have discharged its waste water into the river. This would have adversely affected Kentucky's water supplies. The U.S. Supreme Court held that Kentucky's jurisdiction (and, implicitly, that of West Virginia) extended only to the low-water mark of 1793 (important because the river has been extensively dammed for navigation so that the present river bank is north of the old low-water mark.) Similarly, in the 1990s, Kentucky challenged Illinois's right to collect taxes on a riverboat casino docked in Metropolis , citing its own control of the entire river. A private casino riverboat that docked in Evansville, Indiana , on the Ohio River opened about the same time. Although such boats cruised on the Ohio River in an oval pattern up and down, the state of Kentucky soon protested. Other states had to limit their cruises to going forward, then reversing and going backward on the Indiana shore only. Both Illinois and Indiana have long since changed their laws to allow riverboat casinos to be permanently docked, with Illinois changing in 1999 and Indiana in 2002. The Silver Bridge at Point Pleasant, West Virginia collapsed into the river on December 15, 1967. The collapse killed 46 people who had been crossing when the bridge failed. The bridge had been built in 1929, and by 1967 was carrying too heavy a load for its design. [29] The bridge was rebuilt about one mile downstream and in service as the Silver Memorial Bridge in 1969. The Ohio River as a whole is ranked as the most polluted river in the United States, based on 2009 and 2010 data. The more industrial and regional West Virginia/Pennsylvania tributary, the Monongahela River , ranked 17th for water pollution , behind 16 other American rivers. [30] The Ohio again ranked as the most polluted in 2013, and has been the most polluted river since at least 2001, according to the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission (ORSANCO). The Commission found that 92% of toxic discharges were nitrates , including farm runoff and waste water from industrial processes such as steel production. The Commission also noted mercury pollution as an ongoing concern, citing a 500% increase in mercury discharges between 2007 and 2013. [31] For several decades beginning in the 1950s, the Ohio River was polluted with hundreds of thousands of pounds of PFOA , a fluoride-based chemical used in making teflon , among other things, by the DuPont chemical company from an outflow pipe at its Parkersburg, West Virginia , facility. [32] The Ohio River is extensively industrialized and populated. Regular barge traffic carries cargoes of oil, steel and other industrial goods produced in the region. Major cities located along the northern and southern banks of the river include Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania ; Louisville, Kentucky ; Evansville, Indiana ; and Cincinnati, Ohio . [14] The combined Allegheny-Ohio river is 1,310 miles (2,110 km) long and carries the largest volume of water of any tributary of the Mississippi. The Indians and early European explorers and settlers of the region often considered the Allegheny to be part of the Ohio. The forks (the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers at what is now Pittsburgh) were considered a strategic military location by colonial French and British, and later independent American military authorities. The Ohio River is formed by the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers at what is now Point State Park in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . From there, it flows northwest through Allegheny and Beaver counties, before making an abrupt turn to the south-southwest at the West Virginia \u2013Ohio\u2013Pennsylvania triple-state line (near East Liverpool, Ohio ; Chester, West Virginia ; and Ohioville, Pennsylvania ). From there, it forms the border between West Virginia and Ohio, upstream of Wheeling, West Virginia . The river follows a roughly southwest and then west-northwest course until Cincinnati, before bending to a west-southwest course for most of the remainder of its length. The course forms the northern borders of West Virginia and Kentucky ; and the southern borders of Ohio , Indiana and Illinois , until it joins the Mississippi River at the city of Cairo, Illinois . Where the Ohio joins the Mississippi is the lowest elevation in the state of Illinois, at 315 feet (96 m). The Mississippi River flows to the Gulf of Mexico on the Atlantic Ocean . Among rivers wholly or mostly in the United States, the Ohio is the second largest by discharge volume and the tenth longest and has the eighth largest drainage basin. It serves to separate the Midwestern Great Lakes states from the Upper South states, which were historically border states in the Civil War. The Ohio River is a left (east) and the largest tributary by volume of the Mississippi River in the United States . At the confluence , the Ohio is considerably bigger than the Mississippi, measured by long-term mean discharge. The Ohio River at Cairo is 281,500 cu ft/s (7,960 m 3 /s); [1] and the Mississippi River at Thebes, Illinois , which is upstream of the confluence, is 208,200 cu ft/s (5,897 m 3 /s). [33] The Ohio River flow is greater than that of the Mississippi River, so hydrologically the Ohio River is the main stream of the river system. The Ohio River is a naturally shallow river that was artificially deepened by a series of dams . The natural depth of the river varied from about 3 to 20 feet (1 to 6 m). The dams raise the water level and have turned the river largely into a series of reservoirs , eliminating shallow stretches and allowing for commercial navigation. From its origin to Cincinnati, the average depth is approximately 15 feet (5 m). The largest immediate drop in water level is below the McAlpine Locks and Dam at the Falls of the Ohio at Louisville, Kentucky , where flood stage is reached when the water reaches 23 feet (7 m) on the lower gauge. However, the river's deepest point is 168 feet (51 m) on the western side of Louisville, Kentucky. From Louisville, the river loses depth very gradually until its confluence with the Mississippi at Cairo, Illinois , where it has an approximate depth of 19 feet (6 m). Water levels for the Ohio River from Smithland Lock and Dam upstream to Pittsburgh are predicted daily by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Ohio River Forecast Center. [34] The water depth predictions are relative to each local flood plain based upon predicted rainfall in the Ohio River basin in five reports as follows: The water levels for the Ohio River from Smithland Lock and Dam to Cairo, Illinois, are predicted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Lower Mississippi River Forecast Center. [35] The largest tributaries of the Ohio by discharge volume are: Tennessee River 70,575 cu ft (1,998.5 m 3 )/sec Cumberland River 37,250 cu ft (1,055 m 3 )/sec Wabash River 35,350 cu ft (1,001 m 3 )/sec Allegheny River 19,750 cu ft (559 m 3 )/sec Kanawha River 15,240 cu ft (432 m 3 )/sec Green River 14,574 cu ft (412.7 m 3 )/sec Monongahela River 12,650 cu ft (358 m 3 )/sec Kentucky River 10,064 cu ft (285.0 m 3 )/sec Muskingum River 8,973 cu ft (254.1 m 3 )/sec Scioto River 6,674 cu ft (189.0 m 3 )/sec By drainage basin area, the largest tributaries are: [36] Tennessee River 40,910 sq mi (106,000 km 2 ) Wabash River 33,100 sq mi (86,000 km 2 ) Cumberland River 17,920 sq mi (46,400 km 2 ) Kanawha River 12,200 sq mi (32,000 km 2 ) Allegheny River 11,700 sq mi (30,000 km 2 ) Green River 9,230 sq mi (23,900 km 2 ) Muskingum River 8,040 sq mi (20,800 km 2 ) Monongahela River 7,400 sq mi (19,000 km 2 ) Kentucky River 6,970 sq mi (18,100 km 2 ) Scioto River 6,510 sq mi (16,900 km 2 ) The largest tributaries by length are: [36] Cumberland River 693 mi (1,115 km) Tennessee River 652 mi (1,049 km) Wabash River 474 mi (763 km) Green River 370 mi (600 km) Allegheny River 325 mi (523 km) Licking River 320 mi (510 km).

If you want to learn more, you should visit the National Historical Park dedicated to the Hopewell People next time you\u2019re on the river.\nThe coming of European settlers to North America brought a new group of users to the Ohio River. One of the first known Europeans to travel along the Ohio River was a Frenchman named Rene-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle , who navigated the river in 1669. Cavelier went on to explore more middle-American waterways before his unfortunate death at the hands of his own men in 1687.\nIn 1749, King George II of Britain approved the exploration of the headwaters of the Ohio near modern-day Pittsburgh. This action inevitably led to conflict with the French, who controlled the lands along the western run of the Ohio River. The dispute over the Ohio River was a major factor in the French and Indian War .\nEventually, the British wrested control of the Ohio River from the French. In 1774, to punish the rebellious colonies, Parliament passed legislation granting lands \u201ceast of the Mississippi River and north of the Ohio River\u201d to the French-speaking Catholics of the colony of Quebec. This act was a source of profound irritation to American colonists, so much so that the Quebec Act is sometimes considered one of the Intolerable Acts which led to the American Revolution.\nIn the 1800s, the Ohio River flourished as new settlements grew and expanded, sending human and material traffic up and down the river. Then, as the prelude to the American Civil War began brewing in the mid-1800s, the Ohio became a regular stop on the Underground Railroad as escaped slaves made their way to freedom in the Northern states.\nThe Ohio River remains critically important today. More than $43 billion worth of goods travels along the Ohio River every year. In Pittsburgh alone, more than 120 companies are located along the banks of the Ohio River and the immediately adjacent Monongahela.\nThe Ohio River is also important to agriculture. Millions of gallons of water from the Ohio are used to irrigate a variety of crops in farms throughout the Ohio River Valley. The river even powers multiple hydroelectric power plants, which generate about 5% of the total electricity used in the United States.\nUnfortunately, not all users of the river are respectful of the environment. The Ohio River struggled with a serious pollution problem for a long time. Plants, animals, and fish along the Ohio died out. Finally, in the late 1950s, the Ohio River was so acidic that it would rust out 20-year boat hulls in less than four years.\nAfter decades of sustained effort, the Ohio River of today is much cleaner . Fish, birds, and aquatic plants have returned to most sections of the river, and humans use the water for recreation all the time. However, some companies continue to discharge industrial waste into the river, and it is always a good idea to check with local authorities before eating fish from the river .\nKeystone Answers Fun Fact: The Ohio River was once home to pirates! In the late 18th century, a band of pirates led by Samuel Mason began operating on the Ohio River near Cave-In-Rock, Illinois. The pirates were forced out by the Army in 1799, but continued operating until 1803, when Mason was captured and subsequently killed in an escape attempt.\nOther Posts of Interest\nRivers are naturally flowing waterways that flow towards an ocean, lake, or another river.

From Pennsylvania, the river borders Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois before it joins the Mississippi River and eventually empties into the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe Ohio River begins its course in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at the confluence of the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River. The Ohio River moves northwest and then sweeps southwest, defining the border between Ohio and West Virginia, then Ohio and Kentucky. From there, the river continues southwest, defining Kentucky\u2019s border with Indiana and Illinois before emptying into the Mississippi River near Cairo, Illinois.\nThe barge is one of the most popular ways to ship freight along the Ohio River. Barges and towboats are familiar sights along the Ohio River, cruising along at about five miles per hour. Barges are frequently used to bring products like Pittsburgh steel , coal, oil, and other industrial goods to port.\nThe average barge can carry about 1,500 tons, or 3 million pounds, of cargo. Towboats usually push 15 barges at a time, which means that an average towboat/barge combo can weigh more than 45 million pounds. In other words, the average barge combo floating down the Ohio River weighs about twice as much as the White House!\nMuch like trains, barges do not stop especially fast and have a lot of mass. Therefore, boaters, paddlers, waterskiers, and swimmers should keep a respectful distance from barges.\nThe Ohio River is navigable. Large vessels, barges, and towboats operate on the river all the time. In addition to commercial boat traffic, the Ohio River is popular with anglers, recreational boaters, paddlers, and water enthusiasts of all kinds.\nThere are many locks and dams on the Ohio River that are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and allow boat traffic to flow freely. Boaters must stay out of the restricted areas around the locks and dams and follow local port rules along the river, but otherwise, it is freely navigable.\nThe Ohio River is technically considered a federal waterway. As such, it is under the jurisdiction of the United States Coast Guard. However, the river is also under the jurisdiction of multiple local law enforcement agencies and is subject to state regulations.\nBoaters should familiarize themselves with their prospective routes and the regulations that apply along them. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources website has a good summary of the rules of the river.\nThe depth of the Ohio River varies considerably along the river\u2019s course, but the deepest section is located near Louisville, Kentucky. While the average depth of the Ohio River is about 24 feet, the section near Louisville runs about 130 feet deep! Louisville is also where the Ohio River is widest, spanning almost a mile between banks.\nAs the Ohio winds its way toward the Mississippi, it gradually becomes more and more shallow. Finally, at the junction of the Ohio and the Mississippi, the river is only about 20 feet deep.\nThe Ohio River is a freshwater river. Both the Allegheny and the Monongahela Rivers, which feed the Ohio, are freshwater rivers. The Mississippi, which the Ohio empties into, is also a freshwater river. There is no point at which the Ohio River comes into contact with salt water.\nIn fact, the fresh water of the Ohio River is a critical water source for more than 25 million people who live in the Ohio River Basin . More than 50 million gallons of water are drawn from the Ohio River daily, with more than 2 million destined for consumption. The river is also a vital source of fresh water for agriculture and industry.\nThe Ohio River is a vital waterway for commerce and recreation. Every day, barges push thousands of pounds of materials and products up and down the river, and pleasure-seekers use the river for boating, paddling, bird-watching, and water skiing. From its origin in Pittsburgh, the Ohio River flows to the Mississippi and the Gulf, connecting the great state of Pennsylvania with New Orleans and the rest of the world.", "source_raw_text": "Most everyone has heard of the Ohio River. But where does the Ohio River actually start? The Ohio River starts in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where the Monongahela and the Allegheny Rivers meet. It flows southwest joining the Mississippi River near Cairo, Illinois, which empties into the Gulf of Mexico. The Ohio River is a navigable waterway vital to regional trade and commerce. The Ohio (derived from a Seneca word) is integral to the economy of the states it flows through or borders. So how deep is the Ohio River? Is it freshwater or saltwater?

Last Glacial Maximum .", "At around that time, sea level was 120 metres (390 ft) lower than it is today.", "[30]\nFrom 20,000 years ago until 6,000 years ago, sea level rose steadily around the world.", "As it rose, the corals could then grow higher on the newly submerged maritime margins of the hills of the coastal plain.", "By around 13,000 years ago the sea level was only 60 metres (200

bleaching .", "[60] [61] Mass coral bleaching events due to marine heatwaves occurred in the summers of 1998, 2002, 2006, 2016, 2017 and 2020, [62] [13] [63] and coral bleaching is expected to become an annual occurrence.", "[64] In 2020, a study found that the Great Barrier Reef has lost more than half of its corals since 1995 due to warmer seas driven by climate change.", "[63] [65] As global warming continues, corals will not be able to keep up with increasing ocean temperatures.", "Coral bleaching events lead to increased disease susceptibility, which causes detrimental ecological effects for reef communities.", "[66]\nIn July 2017 UNESCO published in a draft decision, expressing serious concern about the impact of coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef.", "The draft decision also warned Australia that it will not meet the targets of the Reef 2050 report without considerable work to improve water quality.", "[67]\nClimate change has implications for other forms of reef life\u2014some fish's preferred temperature range leads them to seek new habitat, thus increasing chick mortality in predatory seabirds.", "Climate change will also affect the sea turtle's population and available habitat.", "[68]\nBleaching events in benthic coral communities (deeper than 20 metres or 66 feet) in the Great Barrier reef are not as well documented as those at shallower depths, but recent research has shown that benthic communities are just as negatively impacted in the face of rising ocean temperatures.", "Five Great Barrier Reef species of large benthic corals were found bleached under elevated temperatures, affirming that benthic corals are vulnerable to thermal stress.", "[69]\nAnother key threat faced by the Great Barrier Reef is pollution and declining water quality .", "The rivers of north-eastern Australia pollute the Reef during tropical flood events.", "Over 90% of this pollution comes from farm runoff .", "[70] 80% of the land adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef is used for farming including intensive cropping of sugar cane, and major beef cattle grazing.", "Farming practices damage the reef due to overgrazing , increased run-off of agricultural sediments, nutrients and chemicals including fertilisers , herbicides and pesticides representing a major health risk for the coral and biodiversity of the reefs.", "[71]\nAccording to a 2016 report, while higher regulation contributes to less overall pollution from \"other land uses, such as industrial, mining, port development, dredging and urban development\", these can still be locally significant.", "[72] Sediments containing high levels of copper and other heavy metals sourced from the Ok Tedi Mine in Papua New Guinea are a potential pollution risk for the far northern Great Barrier Reef and Torres Strait regions.", "[73] Some 67% of corals died in the reef's worst-hit northern section, the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies report said.", "[74]\nThe runoff problem is exacerbated by the loss of coastal wetlands which act as a natural filter for toxins and help deposit sediment.", "[75] [76] [77] It is thought that the poor water quality is due to increased light and oxygen competition from algae .", "[78]\nFarming fertiliser runoff release nitrogen , phosphorus , and potassium into the oceanic ecosystem, and these limiting nutrients cause massive algal growth which eventually leads to a reduction in oxygen available for other creatures in a process called eutrophication .", "This decreases the biodiversity in the affected areas, altering the species composition .", "A study by Katharina Fabricius and Glen Death of Australian Institute of Marine Science found that hard corals numbers were almost double on reefs that were far from agricultural areas.", "[71]\nFertilizers also increase the amount of phytoplankton available for the crown-of-thorns starfish larvae to consume.", "A study showed that a doubling of the chlorophyll in the water leads to a tenfold increase in the crown-of-thorns starfish larvae's survival rate.", "[71]\nSediment runoff from farming carries chemicals into the reef environment also reduces the amount of light available to the corals decreasing their ability to extract energy from their environment.", "[71]\nPesticides used in farming are made up of heavy metals such as lead, mercury, arsenic and other toxins are released into the wider environment due to erosion of farm soil, which has a detrimental effect on the coral.", "[71]\nMining company Queensland Nickel discharged nitrate-laden water into the Great Barrier Reef in 2009 and 2011 \u2013 on the later occasion releasing 516 tonnes (508 long tons; 569 short tons) of waste water.", "The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park

this potential hazard; however, GBRMPA does not have legislative control over how the Yabulu tailings dam is managed\".", "[79]\nThe crown-of-thorns starfish preys on coral polyps.", "Large outbreaks of these starfish can devastate reefs.", "In 2000, an outbreak contributed to a loss of 66% of live coral cover on sampled reefs in a study by the Reef Research Centre (RRC).", "[80] Outbreaks are believed to occur in natural cycles, worsened by poor water quality and overfishing of the starfish's predators.", "[80]", "[81]\nThe unsustainable overfishing of keystone species , such as the giant Triton , can disrupt food chains vital to reef life.", "Fishing also impacts the reef through increased water pollution from boats, by-catch of unwanted species (such as dolphins and turtles) and habitat destruction from trawling , anchors and nets.", "[82] As of the middle of 2004, approximately one-third of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is protected from species removal of any kind, including fishing, without written permission.", "[83]\nShipping accidents are a pressing concern, as several commercial shipping routes pass through the Great Barrier Reef.", "[84]", "Although the route through the Great Barrier Reef is not easy, reef pilots consider it safer than outside the reef in the event of mechanical failure, since a ship can sit safely while being repaired.", "[85] There have been over 1,600 known shipwrecks in the Great Barrier Reef region.", "[86] On 3 April 2010, the bulk coal carrier Shen Neng 1 ran aground on Douglas Shoals, [87] spilling up to four tonnes of oil into the water and causing extensive damage to the reef.", "[88]\nMain article: Shark culling\nThe government of Queensland has a \"shark control\" program ( shark culling ) that deliberately kills sharks throughout Queensland, including in the Great Barrier Reef.", "[89] [90] Environmentalists and scientists say that this program harms the marine ecosystem ; they also say it is \"outdated, cruel and ineffective\".", "[90] The Queensland \"shark control\" program uses shark nets and drum lines with baited hooks to kill sharks in the Great Barrier Reef \u2013 there are 173 lethal drum lines in the Great Barrier Reef.", "[89] [90] [91]", "In Queensland, sharks found alive on the baited hooks are shot.", "[92] Queensland's \"shark control\" program killed about 50,000 sharks from 1962 to 2018.", "[93] Also, Queensland's \"shark control\" program has also killed many other animals (such as dolphins and turtles ) \u2014 the program killed 84,000 marine animals from

heritage.", "The plan contains all the elements for measurement and improvements, including; long-term sustainability plan, water quality improvement plan and the investment plan for the protection and preservation of The Reef until 2050.", "[95]\nHowever, whereas the 2050 plan aims to incorporate protective measures such as improving water quality, reef restoration, killing of predatory starfish, it does not incorporate additional measures to address what may be the root cause the problem \u2013 climate change, which is caused by greenhouse gas emissions.", "As such, experts doubted whether it would be enough to save the fragile environment.", "[67] [96]", "[97] Another issue is that the time left to the 1.5 \u00b0C warming threshold (the temperature limit that coral reefs can still cope with [98] ) is very limited.", "[99]\nAs part of the Reef 2050 plan, an AUD$443 million grant was given to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation in 2018.", "The announcement of the grant was

naturally help reduce water pollutants.", "To achieve the objectives described above, this plan focuses on non-point sources of pollution, which cannot be traced to a single source such as a waste outlet.", "\nThe plan specifically targets nutrients, pesticides and sediment that make their way into the reef as a result of agricultural activities.", "Other non-point sources of pollution that are attributed to urban areas are covered under different legislation.", "In 2009, the plan was updated.", "The updated version states that to date, none of the efforts undertaken to improve the quality

monitoring and assessment.", "The 2009 report found that 41 out of the 65 actions met their original goals, however, 18 were not progressing well according to evaluation criteria as well as 6 were rated as having unsatisfactory levels of progress.", "\nSome key achievements made since the plan's initial passing in 2003 were the establishment of the Reef Quality Partnership to set targets, report findings and monitor progress towards targets, improved land condition by landowners was rewarded with extended leases, Water Quality Improvement Plans were created to identify regional targets

improving the water quality of the Great Barrier Reef will improve its resilience to climate change.", "The Reefocus summit in 2008, which is also detailed in the report, came to similar conclusions.", "After this, a stakeholder working group was formed that worked between several groups as well as the Australian and Queensland governments to update reef goals and objectives.", "The

that will allow three million cubic metres of sea bed from Abbot Point , north of Bowen, to be transported and unloaded in the waters of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.", "Potential significant harms have been identified in relation to dredge spoil and the process of churning up the sea floor in the area and exposing it to air: firstly, new research shows the finer particles of dredge spoil can cloud the water and block sunlight, thereby starving sea grass and coral up to distances of 80 km away from the point of origin due to the actions of wind and currents.", "Furthermore, dredge spoil can literally smother reef or sea grass to death, while storms can repeatedly resuspend these particles so that the harm caused is ongoing; secondly, disturbed sea floor can release toxic substances into the surrounding environment.", "[125]\nThe dredge spoil from the Abbot Point port project is to be dumped 24 kilometres (15 mi) away, near Bowen in north Queensland, and the approval from the Authority will result in the production of an extra 70 million tonnes of coal annually, worth between A$1.4 billion and $2.8 billion.", "[125] Authority chairman, Dr Russell Reichelt, stated after the confirmation of the approval:\nThis approval is in line with the agency's view that port development along the Great Barrier Reef coastline should be limited to existing ports.", "As a deepwater port that has been in operation for nearly 30 years, Abbot Point is better placed than other ports along the Great Barrier Reef coastline to undertake expansion as the capital and maintenance dredging required will be significantly less than what would be required in other areas.", "It's important to note the seafloor of the approved disposal area consists of sand, silt and clay and does not contain coral reefs or seagrass beds.", "[125]\nThe approval was provided with a corresponding set of 47 new environmental conditions that include the following:\n- A long-term water quality monitoring plan extending five years after the disposal activity is completed.", "\n- A heritage management plan to protect the Catalina second world war aircraft wreck in Abbot Bay.\n- The establishment of an independent dredging and disposal technical advice panel and a management response group, to include community representatives.", "[125] [126]\nThe Australian Federal Government

[4] [5] The reef is located in the Coral Sea , off the coast of Queensland , Australia , separated from the coast by a channel 100 miles wide in places and over 200 feet deep. [6] The Great Barrier Reef can be seen from outer space and is the world's biggest single structure made by living organisms. [7] This reef structure is composed of and built by billions of tiny organisms, known as coral polyps . [8] It supports a wide diversity of life and was selected as a World Heritage Site in 1981. [1] [2] CNN labelled it one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World in 1997. [9] Australian World Heritage places included it in its list in 2007. [10] The Queensland National Trust named it a state icon of Queensland in 2006. [11]\nA large part of the reef is protected by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park , which helps to limit the impact of human use, such as fishing and tourism. Other environmental pressures on the reef and its ecosystem include runoff of manmade pollutants, climate change accompanied by mass coral bleaching , dumping of dredging sludge and cyclic population outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish . [12] According to a study published in October 2012 by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the reef has lost more than half its coral cover since 1985, a finding reaffirmed by a 2020 study which found over half of the reef's coral cover to have been lost between 1995 and 2017, with the effects of a widespread 2020 bleaching event not yet quantified. [13] [14]\nThe Great Barrier Reef has long been known to and used by the Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and is an important part of local groups' cultures and spirituality. The reef is a very popular destination for tourists, especially in the Whitsunday Islands and Cairns regions. Tourism is an important economic activity for the region, generating over AUD$ 3 billion per year. [15] In November 2014, Google launched Google Underwater Street View in 3D of the Great Barrier Reef. [16]\nA March 2016 report stated that coral bleaching was more widespread than previously thought, seriously affecting the northern parts of the reef as a result of warming ocean temperatures . [17] In October 2016, Outside published an obituary for the reef; [18] the article was criticized for being premature and hindering efforts to bolster the resilience of the reef. [19] In March 2017, the journal Nature published a paper showing that huge sections of an 800-kilometre (500 mi) stretch in the northern part of the reef had died in the course of 2016 of high water temperatures, an event that the authors put down to the effects of global climate change. [20] The percentage of baby corals being born on the Great Barrier Reef dropped drastically in 2018 and scientists are describing it as the early stage of a \"huge natural selection event unfolding\". Many of the mature breeding adults died in the bleaching events of 2016\u201317, leading to low coral birth rates. The types of corals that reproduced also changed, leading to a \"long-term reorganisation of the reef ecosystem if the trend continues.\" [21]\nThe Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 (section 54) stipulates an Outlook Report on the Reef's health, pressures, and future every five years. The last report was published in 2019. [22] In March 2022, another mass bleaching event has been confirmed, which raised further concerns about the future of this reef system, especially when considering the possible effects of El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon. [23]\nThe Australian Institute of Marine Science conducts annual surveys of the Great Barrier Reef's status, and the 2022 report showed the greatest recovery in 36 years. It is mainly due to the regrowth of two-thirds of the reef by the fast-growing Acropora coral, which is the dominant coral there. [24]\nThe Great Barrier Reef is a distinct feature of the East Australian Cordillera division. It reaches from Torres Strait (between Bramble Cay , its northernmost island, and the south coast of Papua New Guinea ) in the north to the unnamed passage between Lady Elliot Island (its southernmost island) and Fraser Island in the south. Lady Elliot Island is located 1,915 km (1,190 mi) southeast of Bramble Cay as the crow flies . [25] It includes the smaller Murray Islands . [26]\nThe plate tectonic theory indicates Australia has moved northwards at a rate of 7 cm (2.8 in) per year, starting during the Cenozoic . [27] [28] : 18 Eastern Australia experienced a period of tectonic uplift , which moved the drainage divide in Queensland 400 km (250 mi) inland. Also during this time, Queensland experienced volcanic eruptions leading to central and shield volcanoes and basalt flows. [28] : 19 Some of these became volcanic islands . [28] : 26 After the Coral Sea Basin formed, coral reefs began to grow in the Basin, but until about 25 million years ago, northern Queensland was still in temperate waters south of the tropics\u2014too cool to support coral growth. [28] : 27 The Great Barrier Reef's development history is complex; after Queensland drifted into tropical waters, it was largely influenced by reef growth and decline as sea level changed. [28] : 27\u201328\nReefs can increase in diameter by 1 to 3 centimetres (0.39 to 1.18 in) per year, and grow vertically anywhere from 1 to 25 cm (0.39 to 9.84 in) per year; however, they grow only above a depth of 150 metres (490 ft) due to their need for sunlight, and cannot grow above sea level. [29] When Queensland edged into tropical waters 24 million years ago, some coral grew, [28] : 29 but a sedimentation regime quickly developed with erosion of the Great Dividing Range ; creating river deltas , oozes and turbidites , unsuitable conditions for coral growth. 10 million years ago, the sea level significantly lowered, which further enabled sedimentation. The reef's substrate may have needed to build up from the sediment until its edge was too far away for suspended sediments to inhibit coral growth. In addition, approximately 400,000 years ago there was a particularly warm Interglacial period with higher sea levels and a 4 \u00b0C (7 \u00b0F) water temperature change. [28] : 37\nThe land that formed the substrate of the current Great Barrier Reef was a coastal plain formed from the eroded sediments of the Great Dividing Range with some larger hills (most of which were themselves remnants of older reefs [30] or, in rare cases, volcanoes [28] : 26 ). [28] : 18 The Reef Research Centre, a Cooperative Research Centre , has found coral 'skeleton' deposits that date back half a million years. [31] The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) considers the earliest evidence of complete reef structures to have been 600,000 years ago. [32] According to the GBRMPA, the current, living reef structure is believed to have begun growing on the older platform about 20,000 years ago. [32] The Australian Institute of Marine Science agrees, placing the beginning of the growth of the current reef at the time of the Last Glacial Maximum . At around that time, sea level was 120 metres (390 ft) lower than it is today. [30]\nFrom 20,000 years ago until 6,000 years ago, sea level rose steadily around the world. As it rose, the corals could then grow higher on the newly submerged maritime margins of the hills of the coastal plain. By around 13,000 years ago the sea level was only 60 metres (200 ft) lower than the present day, and corals began to surround the hills of the coastal plain, which were, by then, continental islands . As the sea level rose further still, most of the continental islands were submerged. The corals could then overgrow the submerged hills, to form the present cays and reefs. Sea level here has not risen significantly in the last 6,000 years. [30] The CRC Reef Research Centre estimates the age of the present, living reef structure at 6,000 to 8,000 years old. [31] The shallow water reefs that can be seen in air-photographs and satellite images cover an area of 20,679 km 2 , most (about 80%) of which [33] has grown on top of limestone platforms that are relics of past (Pleistocene) phases of reef growth. [28]\nThe remains of an ancient barrier reef similar to the Great Barrier Reef can be found in The Kimberley , Western Australia. [34]\nThe Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area has been divided into 70 bioregions , [35] of which 30 are reef bioregions. [36] [37] In the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef, ribbon reefs and deltaic reefs have formed; these structures are not found in the rest of the reef system. [31] A previously undiscovered reef, 500 meters tall and 1.5 km wide at the base, was found in the northern area in 2020. [38] There are no atolls in the system, [28] : 7 and reefs attached to the mainland are rare. [28] : 18\nFringing reefs are distributed widely, but are most common towards the southern part of the Great Barrier Reef, attached to high islands, for example, the Whitsunday Islands . Lagoonal reefs are found in the southern Great Barrier Reef, and further north, off the coast of Princess Charlotte Bay . Crescentic reefs are the most common shape of reef in the middle of the system, for example the reefs surrounding Lizard Island . Crescentic reefs are also found in the far north of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and in the Swain Reefs ( 20 \u2013 22 degrees south ). Planar reefs are found in the northern and southern parts, near Cape York Peninsula , Princess Charlotte Bay, and Cairns. Most of the islands on the reef are found on planar reefs. [28] : 158\u2013160\nWonky holes can have localised impact on the reef, providing upwellings of fresh water, sometimes rich in nutrients contributing to eutrophication . [39] [40]\nThe Great Barrier Reef supports an extraordinary diversity of life, including many vulnerable or endangered species , some of which may be endemic to the reef system. [41] [42]\nThirty species of cetaceans have been recorded in the Great Barrier Reef, including the dwarf minke whale , Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin , and the humpback whale . Large populations of dugongs live there. [42] [43] [44] More than 1,500 fish species live on the reef, including the clownfish , red bass , red-throat emperor, and several species of snapper and coral trout . [43] Forty-nine species mass spawn , while eighty-four other species spawn elsewhere in their range. [45] Seventeen species of sea snake live on the Great Barrier Reef in warm waters up to 50 metres (160 ft) deep and are more common in the southern than in the northern section. None found in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area are endemic, nor are any endangered. [46]\nSix species of sea turtles come to the reef to breed: the green sea turtle , leatherback sea turtle , hawksbill turtle , loggerhead sea turtle , flatback turtle , and the olive ridley . The green sea turtles on the Great Barrier Reef have two genetically distinct populations , one in the northern part of the reef and the other in the southern part. [47] Fifteen species of seagrass in beds attract the dugongs and turtles, [43] and provide fish habitat. [28] : 133 The most common genera of seagrasses are Halophila and Halodule . [48]\nSaltwater crocodiles live in mangrove and salt marshes on the coast near the reef. [49] Nesting has not been reported, and the salt water crocodile population in the GBRWHA is wide-ranging but low density. [46] Around 125 species of shark , stingray , skates or chimaera live on the reef. [50] [51] Close to 5,000 species of mollusc have been recorded on the reef, including the giant clam and various nudibranchs and cone snails . [43] Forty-nine species of pipefish and nine species of seahorse have been recorded. [46] At least seven species of frog inhabit the islands. [52]\n215 species of birds (including 22 species of seabirds and 32 species of shorebirds) visit the reef or nest or roost on the islands, [28] : 450\u2013451 including the white-bellied sea eagle and roseate tern . [43] Most nesting sites are on islands in the northern and southern regions of the Great Barrier Reef, with 1.4 to 1.7 million birds using the sites to breed. [53] [54] The islands of the Great Barrier Reef also support 2,195 known plant species; three of these are endemic. The northern islands have 300\u2013350 plant species which tend to be woody, whereas the southern islands have 200 which tend to be herbaceous; the Whitsunday region is the most diverse, supporting 1,141 species. The plants are propagated by birds. [52]\nThere are at least 330 species of ascidians on the reef system with the diameter of 1\u201310 cm (0.4\u20134 in). Between 300 and 500 species of bryozoans live on the reef. [51] Four hundred coral species, both hard corals and soft corals inhabit the reef. [43] The majority of these spawn gametes , breeding in mass spawning events that are triggered by the rising sea temperatures of spring and summer, the lunar cycle, and the diurnal cycle. Reefs in the inner Great Barrier Reef spawn during the week after the full moon in October, while the outer reefs spawn in November and December. [55] Its common soft corals belong to 36 genera. [56] Five hundred species of marine algae or seaweed live on the reef, [43] including thirteen species of genus Halimeda , which deposit calcareous mounds up to 100 metres (110 yd) wide, creating mini-ecosystems on their surface which have been compared to rainforest cover. [28] : 185\nClimate change , pollution, crown-of-thorns starfish and fishing are the primary threats to the health of this reef system. Other threats include shipping accidents, oil spills , and tropical cyclones. [57] Skeletal Eroding Band , a disease of bony corals caused by the protozoan Halofolliculina corallasia , affects 31 coral species. [58] According to a 2012 study by the National Academy of Sciences , since 1985, the Great Barrier Reef has lost more than half of its corals with two-thirds of the loss occurring from 1998 due to the factors listed before. [59]\nThe Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority considers the greatest threat to the Great Barrier Reef to be climate change, causing ocean warming which increases coral bleaching . [60] [61] Mass coral bleaching events due to marine heatwaves occurred in the summers of 1998, 2002, 2006, 2016, 2017 and 2020, [62] [13] [63] and coral bleaching is expected to become an annual occurrence. [64] In 2020, a study found that the Great Barrier Reef has lost more than half of its corals since 1995 due to warmer seas driven by climate change. [63] [65] As global warming continues, corals will not be able to keep up with increasing ocean temperatures. Coral bleaching events lead to increased disease susceptibility, which causes detrimental ecological effects for reef communities. [66]\nIn July 2017 UNESCO published in a draft decision, expressing serious concern about the impact of coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef. The draft decision also warned Australia that it will not meet the targets of the Reef 2050 report without considerable work to improve water quality. [67]\nClimate change has implications for other forms of reef life\u2014some fish's preferred temperature range leads them to seek new habitat, thus increasing chick mortality in predatory seabirds. Climate change will also affect the sea turtle's population and available habitat. [68]\nBleaching events in benthic coral communities (deeper than 20 metres or 66 feet) in the Great Barrier reef are not as well documented as those at shallower depths, but recent research has shown that benthic communities are just as negatively impacted in the face of rising ocean temperatures. Five Great Barrier Reef species of large benthic corals were found bleached under elevated temperatures, affirming that benthic corals are vulnerable to thermal stress. [69]\nAnother key threat faced by the Great Barrier Reef is pollution and declining water quality . The rivers of north-eastern Australia pollute the Reef during tropical flood events. Over 90% of this pollution comes from farm runoff . [70] 80% of the land adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef is used for farming including intensive cropping of sugar cane, and major beef cattle grazing. Farming practices damage the reef due to overgrazing , increased run-off of agricultural sediments, nutrients and chemicals including fertilisers , herbicides and pesticides representing a major health risk for the coral and biodiversity of the reefs. [71]\nAccording to a 2016 report, while higher regulation contributes to less overall pollution from \"other land uses, such as industrial, mining, port development, dredging and urban development\", these can still be locally significant. [72] Sediments containing high levels of copper and other heavy metals sourced from the Ok Tedi Mine in Papua New Guinea are a potential pollution risk for the far northern Great Barrier Reef and Torres Strait regions. [73] Some 67% of corals died in the reef's worst-hit northern section, the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies report said. [74]\nThe runoff problem is exacerbated by the loss of coastal wetlands which act as a natural filter for toxins and help deposit sediment. [75] [76] [77] It is thought that the poor water quality is due to increased light and oxygen competition from algae . [78]\nFarming fertiliser runoff release nitrogen , phosphorus , and potassium into the oceanic ecosystem, and these limiting nutrients cause massive algal growth which eventually leads to a reduction in oxygen available for other creatures in a process called eutrophication . This decreases the biodiversity in the affected areas, altering the species composition . A study by Katharina Fabricius and Glen Death of Australian Institute of Marine Science found that hard corals numbers were almost double on reefs that were far from agricultural areas. [71]\nFertilizers also increase the amount of phytoplankton available for the crown-of-thorns starfish larvae to consume. A study showed that a doubling of the chlorophyll in the water leads to a tenfold increase in the crown-of-thorns starfish larvae's survival rate. [71]\nSediment runoff from farming carries chemicals into the reef environment also reduces the amount of light available to the corals decreasing their ability to extract energy from their environment. [71]\nPesticides used in farming are made up of heavy metals such as lead, mercury, arsenic and other toxins are released into the wider environment due to erosion of farm soil, which has a detrimental effect on the coral. [71]\nMining company Queensland Nickel discharged nitrate-laden water into the Great Barrier Reef in 2009 and 2011 \u2013 on the later occasion releasing 516 tonnes (508 long tons; 569 short tons) of waste water. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) stated \"We have strongly encouraged the company to investigate options that do not entail releasing the material to the environment and to develop a management plan to eliminate this potential hazard; however, GBRMPA does not have legislative control over how the Yabulu tailings dam is managed\". [79]\nThe crown-of-thorns starfish preys on coral polyps. Large outbreaks of these starfish can devastate reefs. In 2000, an outbreak contributed to a loss of 66% of live coral cover on sampled reefs in a study by the Reef Research Centre (RRC). [80] Outbreaks are believed to occur in natural cycles, worsened by poor water quality and overfishing of the starfish's predators. [80] [81]\nThe unsustainable overfishing of keystone species , such as the giant Triton , can disrupt food chains vital to reef life. Fishing also impacts the reef through increased water pollution from boats, by-catch of unwanted species (such as dolphins and turtles) and habitat destruction from trawling , anchors and nets. [82] As of the middle of 2004, approximately one-third of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is protected from species removal of any kind, including fishing, without written permission. [83]\nShipping accidents are a pressing concern, as several commercial shipping routes pass through the Great Barrier Reef. [84] Although the route through the Great Barrier Reef is not easy, reef pilots consider it safer than outside the reef in the event of mechanical failure, since a ship can sit safely while being repaired. [85] There have been over 1,600 known shipwrecks in the Great Barrier Reef region. [86] On 3 April 2010, the bulk coal carrier Shen Neng 1 ran aground on Douglas Shoals, [87] spilling up to four tonnes of oil into the water and causing extensive damage to the reef. [88]\nMain article: Shark culling\nThe government of Queensland has a \"shark control\" program ( shark culling ) that deliberately kills sharks throughout Queensland, including in the Great Barrier Reef. [89] [90] Environmentalists and scientists say that this program harms the marine ecosystem ; they also say it is \"outdated, cruel and ineffective\". [90] The Queensland \"shark control\" program uses shark nets and drum lines with baited hooks to kill sharks in the Great Barrier Reef \u2013 there are 173 lethal drum lines in the Great Barrier Reef. [89] [90] [91] In Queensland, sharks found alive on the baited hooks are shot. [92] Queensland's \"shark control\" program killed about 50,000 sharks from 1962 to 2018. [93] Also, Queensland's \"shark control\" program has also killed many other animals (such as dolphins and turtles ) \u2014 the program killed 84,000 marine animals from 1962 to 2015, including in the Great Barrier Reef. [94] In 2018, Humane Society International filed a lawsuit against the government of Queensland to stop shark culling in the Great Barrier Reef. [91]\nIn March 2015, the Australian and Queensland's governments formed a plan for the protection and preservation of the reef's universal heritage until 2050. This 35 years plan, titled \"Reef 2050 Plan\" is a document proposing possible measures for the long-term management of the pollution, climate change and other issues that threaten the life span and value of this global heritage. The plan contains all the elements for measurement and improvements, including; long-term sustainability plan, water quality improvement plan and the investment plan for the protection and preservation of The Reef until 2050. [95]\nHowever, whereas the 2050 plan aims to incorporate protective measures such as improving water quality, reef restoration, killing of predatory starfish, it does not incorporate additional measures to address what may be the root cause the problem \u2013 climate change, which is caused by greenhouse gas emissions. As such, experts doubted whether it would be enough to save the fragile environment. [67] [96] [97] Another issue is that the time left to the 1.5 \u00b0C warming threshold (the temperature limit that coral reefs can still cope with [98] ) is very limited. [99]\nAs part of the Reef 2050 plan, an AUD$443 million grant was given to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation in 2018. The announcement of the grant was subject to backlash as the grant had avoided proper tender and transparency processes.\nThe Great Barrier Reef contributes to the overall wellbeing of the marine biome. [100] Numerous species of aquatic plants, fish and megafauna use the reef for feeding, shelter and mating. [101] Threats such as ocean acidification , pollution runoff and outbreaks of destructive species like the crown-of-thorns starfish have brought about the decline of this ecosystem. [102] These threats to the reef are not only a danger to the organisms inhabiting it, but also the economy of this region, a large part of which relies on revenue from ecotourism of the Great Barrier Reef. [103]\nThe Australian government has had the goal of protecting this World Heritage Site since 1972 when they created The Australian Institute of Marine Science. [104] The Australian and Queensland governments have contributed about $142.5 million to their National Environmental Science Program which is how they've collected much of their data regarding threats to the Great Barrier Reef. [104] In addition, the Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan was announced in 2018 in order to help transition local communities, agricultural organizations and industries to more sustainable practices. [105] This plan will join the Queensland government and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to manage the amounts of runoff that reach the Great Barrier Reef as well as mitigating crown-of-thorns starfish population flare-ups. [105]\nThe Great Barrier Reef has long been known to and used by the Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Aboriginal Australians have been living in the area for at least 40,000 years, [106] and Torres Strait Islanders since about 10,000 years ago. [107] For these 70 or so clan groups , the reef is also an important cultural feature. [108]\nIn 1768 Louis de Bougainville found the reef during an exploratory mission, but did not claim the area for the French. [109] On 11 June 1770, HM Bark Endeavour , captained by explorer James Cook , ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef, sustaining considerable damage. Lightening the ship and re-floating it during an incoming tide eventually saved it. [110] One of the most famous wrecks was HMS Pandora , which sank on 29 August 1791, killing 35 men. The Queensland Museum has led archaeological digs to wreck of Pandora since 1983. [111] Because the reef had no atolls, it was largely unstudied in the 19th century. [28] : 7 During this time, some of the reef's islands were mined for deposits of guano , and lighthouses were built as beacons throughout the system. [28] : 452 as in Raine Island , the earliest example. [112] In 1922, the Great Barrier Reef Committee began carrying out much of the early research on the reef. [28] : 9\nRoyal Commissions disallowed oil drilling in the Great Barrier Reef, in 1975 the Government of Australia created the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and prohibited various activities. [113] The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park does not include the entire Great Barrier Reef Province. [25] The park is managed, in partnership with the Government of Queensland , through the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to ensure that it is used in a sustainable manner. A combination of zoning , management plans, permits, education and incentives (such as eco-tourism certification) are employed in the effort to conserve the reef. [57] [114]\nIn 1999, the Australian Parliament passed the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act , which improved the operation of national environmental law by providing guidance about regional biodiversity conservation priorities. The marine bioregional planning process came from the implementation of this law. This process conserves marine biodiversity by considering the whole ecosystem a species is in and how different species interact in the marine environment.\nThere are two steps to this process. The first step is to identify regional conservation priorities in the five (currently) different marine regions. The second step is to identify marine reserves (protected areas or marine parks) to be added to Australia's National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas. Like protected areas on land, marine reserves are created to protect biodiversity for generations to come. Marine reserves are identified based on criteria written in a document created by Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council called \"Guidelines for establishing the national representative system of marine protected areas\", also known as just \"the Guidelines\". These guidelines are nationally recognised and implemented at the local level based on the Australian policy for implementation outlined in the \"Goals and Principles for the Establishment of the National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas in Commonwealth Waters\". These policies are in place to make sure that a marine reserve is only added to the NRSMPA after careful evaluation of different data.\nThe priorities for each region are created based on human and environmental threats and the Marine Bioregional Plans are drafted to address these priorities. To assess different region's priorities, three steps are taken, first, a bioregional profile is created, second, a bioregional plan is drafted, and third, the plan is finalised. After the plan is finalised, activity in different bioregions may become limited based on particular threats an activity may pose. [115]\nIn 2001, the GBRMPA released a report about the declining water quality in the Great Barrier Reef and detailed the importance of this issue. In response to this report, in 2003, the Australian and Queensland governments launched a joint initiative to improve the quality of water entering the Great Barrier Reef. [116] The decline in the quality of water over the past 150 years (due to development) has contributed to coral bleaching, algal blooms , and pesticide pollution . These forms of pollution have made the reef less resilient to climate change.\nWhen the plan was introduced in October 2003, it originally contained 65 actions built on previous legislation. Their immediate goal was to halt and reverse the decline in water quality entering the reef by 2013. By 2020, they hope that the quality of the water entering in the reef improves enough so that it doesn't have a detrimental impact on the health of the Great Barrier Reef. To achieve these goals they decided to reduce pollutants in the water entering the reef and to rehabilitate and conserve areas of the reef that naturally help reduce water pollutants. To achieve the objectives described above, this plan focuses on non-point sources of pollution, which cannot be traced to a single source such as a waste outlet.\nThe plan specifically targets nutrients, pesticides and sediment that make their way into the reef as a result of agricultural activities. Other non-point sources of pollution that are attributed to urban areas are covered under different legislation. In 2009, the plan was updated. The updated version states that to date, none of the efforts undertaken to improve the quality of water entering the reef has been successful. The new plan attempts to address this issue by \"targeting priority outcomes, integrating industry and community initiatives and incorporating new policy and regulatory frameworks (Reef Plan 5)\". This updated version has improved the clarity of the previous plan and targets set by that plan, have improved accountability and further improved monitoring and assessment. The 2009 report found that 41 out of the 65 actions met their original goals, however, 18 were not progressing well according to evaluation criteria as well as 6 were rated as having unsatisfactory levels of progress.\nSome key achievements made since the plan's initial passing in 2003 were the establishment of the Reef Quality Partnership to set targets, report findings and monitor progress towards targets, improved land condition by landowners was rewarded with extended leases, Water Quality Improvement Plans were created to identify regional targets and identified management changes that needed to be made to reach those targets, Nutrient Management Zones have been created to combat sediment loss in particular areas, education programs have been started to help gather support for sustainable agriculture, changes to land management practices have taken place through the implementation of the Farm Management Systems and codes of practice, the creation of the Queensland Wetland program and other achievements were made to help improve the water quality flowing into the coral reefs.\nA taskforce of scientists was also created to assess the impact of different parts of the plan on the quality of water flowing into the coral reefs. They found that many of the goals have yet to be reached but found more evidence that states that improving the water quality of the Great Barrier Reef will improve its resilience to climate change. The Reefocus summit in 2008, which is also detailed in the report, came to similar conclusions. After this, a stakeholder working group was formed that worked between several groups as well as the Australian and Queensland governments to update reef goals and objectives. The updated version of the plan focuses on strategic priority areas and actions to achieve 2013 goals. Also quantitative targets have been made to critically assess whether targets are being met.\nSome examples of the water quality goals outlined by this plan are that by 2013, there will be a 50% reduction in nitrogen and phosphorus loads at the end of catchments and that by 2020, there will be a reduction in sediment load by 20%. The plan also outlines a number of steps that must be taken by landholders to help improve grazing, soil, nutrient, and chemical management practices. There are also a number of supporting initiatives to take place outlined in the plan to help create a framework to improve land use practices which will in turn improve water quality.\nThrough these means the governments of Australia and Queensland hope to improve water quality by 2013. The 2013 outlook report and revised water quality plan will assess what needs to be done in the future to improve water quality and the livelihoods of the wildlife that resides there. [117]\nIn July 2004, a new zoning plan took effect for the entire Marine Park, and has been widely acclaimed as a new global benchmark for marine ecosystem conservation. [118] The rezoning was based on the application of systematic conservation planning techniques, using marxan software. [119] While protection across the Marine Park was improved, the highly protected zones increased from 4.5% to over 33.3%. [120] At the time, it was the largest Marine Protected Area in the world, although in 2006, the new Northwestern Hawaiian Islands National Monument became the largest. [121]\nIn 2006, a review of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act of 1975 recommended that there should be no further zoning plan changes until 2013, and that every five years, a peer-reviewed outlook report should be published, examining the reef's health, management, and environmental pressures. [5] [122] In each outlook report, several assessments are required. Each assessment has a set of assessment criteria that allows for better presentation of available evidence. Each assessment is judged by these criteria and given a grade. Every outlook report follows the same judging and grading process so that information can be tracked over time. No new research is done to produce the report. Only readily available information goes into the report so little of what is known about the Reef is actually featured in each outlook report. [123]\nIn December 2013, Greg Hunt , the Australian environment minister , approved a plan for dredging to create three shipping terminals as part of the construction of a coalport. According to corresponding approval documents, the process will create around 3 million cubic metres of dredged seabed that will be dumped within the Great Barrier Reef marine park area. [124]\nOn 31 January 2014, the GBRMPA issued a dumping permit that will allow three million cubic metres of sea bed from Abbot Point , north of Bowen, to be transported and unloaded in the waters of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Potential significant harms have been identified in relation to dredge spoil and the process of churning up the sea floor in the area and exposing it to air: firstly, new research shows the finer particles of dredge spoil can cloud the water and block sunlight, thereby starving sea grass and coral up to distances of 80 km away from the point of origin due to the actions of wind and currents. Furthermore, dredge spoil can literally smother reef or sea grass to death, while storms can repeatedly resuspend these particles so that the harm caused is ongoing; secondly, disturbed sea floor can release toxic substances into the surrounding environment. [125]\nThe dredge spoil from the Abbot Point port project is to be dumped 24 kilometres (15 mi) away, near Bowen in north Queensland, and the approval from the Authority will result in the production of an extra 70 million tonnes of coal annually, worth between A$1.4 billion and $2.8 billion. [125] Authority chairman, Dr Russell Reichelt, stated after the confirmation of the approval:\nThis approval is in line with the agency's view that port development along the Great Barrier Reef coastline should be limited to existing ports. As a deepwater port that has been in operation for nearly 30 years, Abbot Point is better placed than other ports along the Great Barrier Reef coastline to undertake expansion as the capital and maintenance dredging required will be significantly less than what would be required in other areas. It's important to note the seafloor of the approved disposal area consists of sand, silt and clay and does not contain coral reefs or seagrass beds. [125]\nThe approval was provided with a corresponding set of 47 new environmental conditions that include the following:\n- A long-term water quality monitoring plan extending five years after the disposal activity is completed.\n- A heritage management plan to protect the Catalina second world war aircraft wreck in Abbot Bay.\n- The establishment of an independent dredging and disposal technical advice panel and a management response group, to include community representatives. [125] [126]\nThe Australian Federal Government announced on 13 November that there would now be a ban on the dumping of dredge spoil in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The World Heritage Committee asked Environment Minister Greg Hunt to investigate alternative options to dump on land instead. The Queensland government and the Commonwealth have now accepted the alternative option and advice from The World Heritage Committee and will now commence dumping on land. [127]\nDue to its vast biodiversity , warm clear waters and accessibility from the tourist boats called \" live aboards \", the reef is a very popular destination, especially for scuba divers . Tourism on the Great Barrier Reef is concentrated in Cairns and also The Whitsundays due to their accessibility. These areas make up 7%\u20138% of the park's area. [57] The Whitsundays and Cairns have their own Plans of Management. [128] Many cities along the Queensland coast offer daily boat trips. Several continental and coral cay islands are now resorts , including Green Island and Lady Elliot Island . As of 1996, 27 islands on the Great Barrier Reef supported resorts. [57]\nIn 1996, most of the tourism in the region was domestically generated and the most popular visiting times were during the Australian winter. At this time, it was estimated that tourists to the Great Barrier Reef contributed A$ 776 million per annum. [129] As the largest commercial activity in the region, it was estimated in 2003 that tourism generated over A$4 billion annually, [130] and the 2005 estimate increased to A$5.1 billion. [128] A Deloitte report published by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in March 2013 states that the Reef's 2,000 kilometres of coastline attracts tourism worth A$6.4 billion annually and employs more than 64,000 people. [131]\nApproximately two million people visit the Great Barrier Reef each year. [132] Although most of these visits are managed in partnership with the marine Tourism industry, there is a concern among the general public that tourism is harmful to the Great Barrier Reef. [57]\nA variety of boat tours and cruises are offered, from single day trips, to longer voyages. Boat sizes range from dinghies to superyachts . [133] Glass-bottomed boats and underwater observatories are also popular, as are helicopter flights. [134] [135] By far, the most popular tourist activities on the Great Barrier Reef are snorkelling and diving, for which pontoons are often used, and the area is often enclosed by nets. The outer part of the Great Barrier Reef is favoured for such activities, due to water quality. [ citation needed ]\nManagement of tourism in the Great Barrier Reef is geared towards making tourism ecologically sustainable . A daily fee is levied that goes towards research of the Great Barrier Reef. [128] This fee ends up being 20% of the GBRMPA's income. [136] Policies on cruise ships , bareboat charters , and anchorages limit the traffic on the Great Barrier Reef. [128]\nThe problems that surround ecotourism in the Great Barrier Reef revolve around permanent tourism platforms. Platforms are large, ship-like vessels that act as a base for tourists while scuba diving and snorkelling in the Great Barrier Reef. Seabirds will land on the platforms and defecate which will eventually be washed into the sea. The feces carry nitrogen, phosphorus and often DDT and mercury , which cause aspergillosis , yellow-band disease , and black band disease . Areas without tourism platforms have 14 out of 9,468 (1.1%) diseased corals versus areas with tourism platforms that have 172 out of 7,043 (12%) diseased corals. [137] Tourism is a major economic activity for the region. Thus, while non-permanent platforms could be possible in some areas, overall, permanent platforms are likely a necessity. Solutions have been suggested to siphon bird waste into gutters connecting to tanks helping lower runoff that causes coral disease. [138]\nThe Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has also placed many permanent anchorage points around the general use areas. These act to reduce damage to the reef due to anchoring destroying soft coral, chipping hard coral, and disturbing sediment as it is dragged across the bottom. Tourism operators also must comply with speed limits when travelling to or from tourist destinations, to prevent excessive wake from the boats disturbing the reef ecosystem. [ citation needed ]\nThe fishing industry in the Great Barrier Reef, controlled by the Queensland Government, is worth A$ 1 billion annually. [15] It employs approximately 2000 people, and fishing in the Great Barrier Reef is pursued commercially, for recreation, and as a traditional means for feeding one's family.

[4] [5] The reef is located in the Coral Sea , off the coast of Queensland , Australia , separated from the coast by a channel 100 miles wide in places and over 200 feet deep. [6] The Great Barrier Reef can be seen from outer space and is the world's biggest single structure made by living organisms. [7] This reef structure is composed of and built by billions of tiny organisms, known as coral polyps . [8] It supports a wide diversity of life and was selected as a World Heritage Site in 1981. [1] [2] CNN labelled it one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World in 1997. [9] Australian World Heritage places included it in its list in 2007. [10] The Queensland National Trust named it a state icon of Queensland in 2006. [11] A large part of the reef is protected by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park , which helps to limit the impact of human use, such as fishing and tourism. Other environmental pressures on the reef and its ecosystem include runoff of manmade pollutants, climate change accompanied by mass coral bleaching , dumping of dredging sludge and cyclic population outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish . [12] According to a study published in October 2012 by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the reef has lost more than half its coral cover since 1985, a finding reaffirmed by a 2020 study which found over half of the reef's coral cover to have been lost between 1995 and 2017, with the effects of a widespread 2020 bleaching event not yet quantified. [13] [14] The Great Barrier Reef has long been known to and used by the Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and is an important part of local groups' cultures and spirituality. The reef is a very popular destination for tourists, especially in the Whitsunday Islands and Cairns regions. Tourism is an important economic activity for the region, generating over AUD$ 3 billion per year. [15] In November 2014, Google launched Google Underwater Street View in 3D of the Great Barrier Reef. [16] A March 2016 report stated that coral bleaching was more widespread than previously thought, seriously affecting the northern parts of the reef as a result of warming ocean temperatures . [17] In October 2016, Outside published an obituary for the reef; [18] the article was criticized for being premature and hindering efforts to bolster the resilience of the reef. [19] In March 2017, the journal Nature published a paper showing that huge sections of an 800-kilometre (500 mi) stretch in the northern part of the reef had died in the course of 2016 of high water temperatures, an event that the authors put down to the effects of global climate change. [20] The percentage of baby corals being born on the Great Barrier Reef dropped drastically in 2018 and scientists are describing it as the early stage of a \"huge natural selection event unfolding\". Many of the mature breeding adults died in the bleaching events of 2016\u201317, leading to low coral birth rates. The types of corals that reproduced also changed, leading to a \"long-term reorganisation of the reef ecosystem if the trend continues.\" [21] The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 (section 54) stipulates an Outlook Report on the Reef's health, pressures, and future every five years. The last report was published in 2019. [22] In March 2022, another mass bleaching event has been confirmed, which raised further concerns about the future of this reef system, especially when considering the possible effects of El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon. [23] The Australian Institute of Marine Science conducts annual surveys of the Great Barrier Reef's status, and the 2022 report showed the greatest recovery in 36 years. It is mainly due to the regrowth of two-thirds of the reef by the fast-growing Acropora coral, which is the dominant coral there. [24] The Great Barrier Reef is a distinct feature of the East Australian Cordillera division. It reaches from Torres Strait (between Bramble Cay , its northernmost island, and the south coast of Papua New Guinea ) in the north to the unnamed passage between Lady Elliot Island (its southernmost island) and Fraser Island in the south. Lady Elliot Island is located 1,915 km (1,190 mi) southeast of Bramble Cay as the crow flies . [25] It includes the smaller Murray Islands . [26] The plate tectonic theory indicates Australia has moved northwards at a rate of 7 cm (2.8 in) per year, starting during the Cenozoic . [27] [28] : 18 Eastern Australia experienced a period of tectonic uplift , which moved the drainage divide in Queensland 400 km (250 mi) inland. Also during this time, Queensland experienced volcanic eruptions leading to central and shield volcanoes and basalt flows. [28] : 19 Some of these became volcanic islands . [28] : 26 After the Coral Sea Basin formed, coral reefs began to grow in the Basin, but until about 25 million years ago, northern Queensland was still in temperate waters south of the tropics\u2014too cool to support coral growth. [28] : 27 The Great Barrier Reef's development history is complex; after Queensland drifted into tropical waters, it was largely influenced by reef growth and decline as sea level changed. [28] : 27\u201328 Reefs can increase in diameter by 1 to 3 centimetres (0.39 to 1.18 in) per year, and grow vertically anywhere from 1 to 25 cm (0.39 to 9.84 in) per year; however, they grow only above a depth of 150 metres (490 ft) due to their need for sunlight, and cannot grow above sea level. [29] When Queensland edged into tropical waters 24 million years ago, some coral grew, [28] : 29 but a sedimentation regime quickly developed with erosion of the Great Dividing Range ; creating river deltas , oozes and turbidites , unsuitable conditions for coral growth. 10 million years ago, the sea level significantly lowered, which further enabled sedimentation. The reef's substrate may have needed to build up from the sediment until its edge was too far away for suspended sediments to inhibit coral growth. In addition, approximately 400,000 years ago there was a particularly warm Interglacial period with higher sea levels and a 4 \u00b0C (7 \u00b0F) water temperature change. [28] : 37 The land that formed the substrate of the current Great Barrier Reef was a coastal plain formed from the eroded sediments of the Great Dividing Range with some larger hills (most of which were themselves remnants of older reefs [30] or, in rare cases, volcanoes [28] : 26 ). [28] : 18 The Reef Research Centre, a Cooperative Research Centre , has found coral 'skeleton' deposits that date back half a million years. [31] The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) considers the earliest evidence of complete reef structures to have been 600,000 years ago. [32] According to the GBRMPA, the current, living reef structure is believed to have begun growing on the older platform about 20,000 years ago. [32] The Australian Institute of Marine Science agrees, placing the beginning of the growth of the current reef at the time of the Last Glacial Maximum . At around that time, sea level was 120 metres (390 ft) lower than it is today. [30] From 20,000 years ago until 6,000 years ago, sea level rose steadily around the world. As it rose, the corals could then grow higher on the newly submerged maritime margins of the hills of the coastal plain. By around 13,000 years ago the sea level was only 60 metres (200 ft) lower than the present day, and corals began to surround the hills of the coastal plain, which were, by then, continental islands . As the sea level rose further still, most of the continental islands were submerged. The corals could then overgrow the submerged hills, to form the present cays and reefs. Sea level here has not risen significantly in the last 6,000 years. [30] The CRC Reef Research Centre estimates the age of the present, living reef structure at 6,000 to 8,000 years old. [31] The shallow water reefs that can be seen in air-photographs and satellite images cover an area of 20,679 km 2 , most (about 80%) of which [33] has grown on top of limestone platforms that are relics of past (Pleistocene) phases of reef growth. [28] The remains of an ancient barrier reef similar to the Great Barrier Reef can be found in The Kimberley , Western Australia. [34] The Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area has been divided into 70 bioregions , [35] of which 30 are reef bioregions. [36] [37] In the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef, ribbon reefs and deltaic reefs have formed; these structures are not found in the rest of the reef system. [31] A previously undiscovered reef, 500 meters tall and 1.5 km wide at the base, was found in the northern area in 2020. [38] There are no atolls in the system, [28] : 7 and reefs attached to the mainland are rare. [28] : 18 Fringing reefs are distributed widely, but are most common towards the southern part of the Great Barrier Reef, attached to high islands, for example, the Whitsunday Islands . Lagoonal reefs are found in the southern Great Barrier Reef, and further north, off the coast of Princess Charlotte Bay . Crescentic reefs are the most common shape of reef in the middle of the system, for example the reefs surrounding Lizard Island . Crescentic reefs are also found in the far north of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and in the Swain Reefs ( 20 \u2013 22 degrees south ). Planar reefs are found in the northern and southern parts, near Cape York Peninsula , Princess Charlotte Bay, and Cairns. Most of the islands on the reef are found on planar reefs. [28] : 158\u2013160 Wonky holes can have localised impact on the reef, providing upwellings of fresh water, sometimes rich in nutrients contributing to eutrophication . [39] [40] The Great Barrier Reef supports an extraordinary diversity of life, including many vulnerable or endangered species , some of which may be endemic to the reef system. [41] [42] Thirty species of cetaceans have been recorded in the Great Barrier Reef, including the dwarf minke whale , Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin , and the humpback whale . Large populations of dugongs live there. [42] [43] [44] More than 1,500 fish species live on the reef, including the clownfish , red bass , red-throat emperor, and several species of snapper and coral trout . [43] Forty-nine species mass spawn , while eighty-four other species spawn elsewhere in their range. [45] Seventeen species of sea snake live on the Great Barrier Reef in warm waters up to 50 metres (160 ft) deep and are more common in the southern than in the northern section. None found in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area are endemic, nor are any endangered. [46] Six species of sea turtles come to the reef to breed: the green sea turtle , leatherback sea turtle , hawksbill turtle , loggerhead sea turtle , flatback turtle , and the olive ridley . The green sea turtles on the Great Barrier Reef have two genetically distinct populations , one in the northern part of the reef and the other in the southern part. [47] Fifteen species of seagrass in beds attract the dugongs and turtles, [43] and provide fish habitat. [28] : 133 The most common genera of seagrasses are Halophila and Halodule . [48] Saltwater crocodiles live in mangrove and salt marshes on the coast near the reef. [49] Nesting has not been reported, and the salt water crocodile population in the GBRWHA is wide-ranging but low density. [46] Around 125 species of shark , stingray , skates or chimaera live on the reef. [50] [51] Close to 5,000 species of mollusc have been recorded on the reef, including the giant clam and various nudibranchs and cone snails . [43] Forty-nine species of pipefish and nine species of seahorse have been recorded. [46] At least seven species of frog inhabit the islands. [52] 215 species of birds (including 22 species of seabirds and 32 species of shorebirds) visit the reef or nest or roost on the islands, [28] : 450\u2013451 including the white-bellied sea eagle and roseate tern . [43] Most nesting sites are on islands in the northern and southern regions of the Great Barrier Reef, with 1.4 to 1.7 million birds using the sites to breed. [53] [54] The islands of the Great Barrier Reef also support 2,195 known plant species; three of these are endemic. The northern islands have 300\u2013350 plant species which tend to be woody, whereas the southern islands have 200 which tend to be herbaceous; the Whitsunday region is the most diverse, supporting 1,141 species. The plants are propagated by birds. [52] There are at least 330 species of ascidians on the reef system with the diameter of 1\u201310 cm (0.4\u20134 in). Between 300 and 500 species of bryozoans live on the reef. [51] Four hundred coral species, both hard corals and soft corals inhabit the reef. [43] The majority of these spawn gametes , breeding in mass spawning events that are triggered by the rising sea temperatures of spring and summer, the lunar cycle, and the diurnal cycle. Reefs in the inner Great Barrier Reef spawn during the week after the full moon in October, while the outer reefs spawn in November and December. [55] Its common soft corals belong to 36 genera. [56] Five hundred species of marine algae or seaweed live on the reef, [43] including thirteen species of genus Halimeda , which deposit calcareous mounds up to 100 metres (110 yd) wide, creating mini-ecosystems on their surface which have been compared to rainforest cover. [28] : 185 Climate change , pollution, crown-of-thorns starfish and fishing are the primary threats to the health of this reef system. Other threats include shipping accidents, oil spills , and tropical cyclones. [57] Skeletal Eroding Band , a disease of bony corals caused by the protozoan Halofolliculina corallasia , affects 31 coral species. [58] According to a 2012 study by the National Academy of Sciences , since 1985, the Great Barrier Reef has lost more than half of its corals with two-thirds of the loss occurring from 1998 due to the factors listed before. [59] The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority considers the greatest threat to the Great Barrier Reef to be climate change, causing ocean warming which increases coral bleaching . [60] [61] Mass coral bleaching events due to marine heatwaves occurred in the summers of 1998, 2002, 2006, 2016, 2017 and 2020, [62] [13] [63] and coral bleaching is expected to become an annual occurrence. [64] In 2020, a study found that the Great Barrier Reef has lost more than half of its corals since 1995 due to warmer seas driven by climate change. [63] [65] As global warming continues, corals will not be able to keep up with increasing ocean temperatures. Coral bleaching events lead to increased disease susceptibility, which causes detrimental ecological effects for reef communities. [66] In July 2017 UNESCO published in a draft decision, expressing serious concern about the impact of coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef. The draft decision also warned Australia that it will not meet the targets of the Reef 2050 report without considerable work to improve water quality. [67] Climate change has implications for other forms of reef life\u2014some fish's preferred temperature range leads them to seek new habitat, thus increasing chick mortality in predatory seabirds. Climate change will also affect the sea turtle's population and available habitat. [68] Bleaching events in benthic coral communities (deeper than 20 metres or 66 feet) in the Great Barrier reef are not as well documented as those at shallower depths, but recent research has shown that benthic communities are just as negatively impacted in the face of rising ocean temperatures. Five Great Barrier Reef species of large benthic corals were found bleached under elevated temperatures, affirming that benthic corals are vulnerable to thermal stress. [69] Another key threat faced by the Great Barrier Reef is pollution and declining water quality . The rivers of north-eastern Australia pollute the Reef during tropical flood events. Over 90% of this pollution comes from farm runoff . [70] 80% of the land adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef is used for farming including intensive cropping of sugar cane, and major beef cattle grazing. Farming practices damage the reef due to overgrazing , increased run-off of agricultural sediments, nutrients and chemicals including fertilisers , herbicides and pesticides representing a major health risk for the coral and biodiversity of the reefs. [71] According to a 2016 report, while higher regulation contributes to less overall pollution from \"other land uses, such as industrial, mining, port development, dredging and urban development\", these can still be locally significant. [72] Sediments containing high levels of copper and other heavy metals sourced from the Ok Tedi Mine in Papua New Guinea are a potential pollution risk for the far northern Great Barrier Reef and Torres Strait regions. [73] Some 67% of corals died in the reef's worst-hit northern section, the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies report said. [74] The runoff problem is exacerbated by the loss of coastal wetlands which act as a natural filter for toxins and help deposit sediment. [75] [76] [77] It is thought that the poor water quality is due to increased light and oxygen competition from algae . [78] Farming fertiliser runoff release nitrogen , phosphorus , and potassium into the oceanic ecosystem, and these limiting nutrients cause massive algal growth which eventually leads to a reduction in oxygen available for other creatures in a process called eutrophication . This decreases the biodiversity in the affected areas, altering the species composition . A study by Katharina Fabricius and Glen Death of Australian Institute of Marine Science found that hard corals numbers were almost double on reefs that were far from agricultural areas. [71] Fertilizers also increase the amount of phytoplankton available for the crown-of-thorns starfish larvae to consume. A study showed that a doubling of the chlorophyll in the water leads to a tenfold increase in the crown-of-thorns starfish larvae's survival rate. [71] Sediment runoff from farming carries chemicals into the reef environment also reduces the amount of light available to the corals decreasing their ability to extract energy from their environment. [71] Pesticides used in farming are made up of heavy metals such as lead, mercury, arsenic and other toxins are released into the wider environment due to erosion of farm soil, which has a detrimental effect on the coral. [71] Mining company Queensland Nickel discharged nitrate-laden water into the Great Barrier Reef in 2009 and 2011 \u2013 on the later occasion releasing 516 tonnes (508 long tons; 569 short tons) of waste water. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) stated \"We have strongly encouraged the company to investigate options that do not entail releasing the material to the environment and to develop a management plan to eliminate this potential hazard; however, GBRMPA does not have legislative control over how the Yabulu tailings dam is managed\". [79] The crown-of-thorns starfish preys on coral polyps. Large outbreaks of these starfish can devastate reefs. In 2000, an outbreak contributed to a loss of 66% of live coral cover on sampled reefs in a study by the Reef Research Centre (RRC). [80] Outbreaks are believed to occur in natural cycles, worsened by poor water quality and overfishing of the starfish's predators. [80] [81] The unsustainable overfishing of keystone species , such as the giant Triton , can disrupt food chains vital to reef life. Fishing also impacts the reef through increased water pollution from boats, by-catch of unwanted species (such as dolphins and turtles) and habitat destruction from trawling , anchors and nets. [82] As of the middle of 2004, approximately one-third of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is protected from species removal of any kind, including fishing, without written permission. [83] Shipping accidents are a pressing concern, as several commercial shipping routes pass through the Great Barrier Reef. [84] Although the route through the Great Barrier Reef is not easy, reef pilots consider it safer than outside the reef in the event of mechanical failure, since a ship can sit safely while being repaired. [85] There have been over 1,600 known shipwrecks in the Great Barrier Reef region. [86] On 3 April 2010, the bulk coal carrier Shen Neng 1 ran aground on Douglas Shoals, [87] spilling up to four tonnes of oil into the water and causing extensive damage to the reef. [88] Main article: Shark culling The government of Queensland has a \"shark control\" program ( shark culling ) that deliberately kills sharks throughout Queensland, including in the Great Barrier Reef. [89] [90] Environmentalists and scientists say that this program harms the marine ecosystem ; they also say it is \"outdated, cruel and ineffective\". [90] The Queensland \"shark control\" program uses shark nets and drum lines with baited hooks to kill sharks in the Great Barrier Reef \u2013 there are 173 lethal drum lines in the Great Barrier Reef. [89] [90] [91] In Queensland, sharks found alive on the baited hooks are shot. [92] Queensland's \"shark control\" program killed about 50,000 sharks from 1962 to 2018. [93] Also, Queensland's \"shark control\" program has also killed many other animals (such as dolphins and turtles ) \u2014 the program killed 84,000 marine animals from 1962 to 2015, including in the Great Barrier Reef. [94] In 2018, Humane Society International filed a lawsuit against the government of Queensland to stop shark culling in the Great Barrier Reef. [91] In March 2015, the Australian and Queensland's governments formed a plan for the protection and preservation of the reef's universal heritage until 2050. This 35 years plan, titled \"Reef 2050 Plan\" is a document proposing possible measures for the long-term management of the pollution, climate change and other issues that threaten the life span and value of this global heritage. The plan contains all the elements for measurement and improvements, including; long-term sustainability plan, water quality improvement plan and the investment plan for the protection and preservation of The Reef until 2050. [95] However, whereas the 2050 plan aims to incorporate protective measures such as improving water quality, reef restoration, killing of predatory starfish, it does not incorporate additional measures to address what may be the root cause the problem \u2013 climate change, which is caused by greenhouse gas emissions. As such, experts doubted whether it would be enough to save the fragile environment. [67] [96] [97] Another issue is that the time left to the 1.5 \u00b0C warming threshold (the temperature limit that coral reefs can still cope with [98] ) is very limited. [99] As part of the Reef 2050 plan, an AUD$443 million grant was given to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation in 2018. The announcement of the grant was subject to backlash as the grant had avoided proper tender and transparency processes. The Great Barrier Reef contributes to the overall wellbeing of the marine biome. [100] Numerous species of aquatic plants, fish and megafauna use the reef for feeding, shelter and mating. [101] Threats such as ocean acidification , pollution runoff and outbreaks of destructive species like the crown-of-thorns starfish have brought about the decline of this ecosystem. [102] These threats to the reef are not only a danger to the organisms inhabiting it, but also the economy of this region, a large part of which relies on revenue from ecotourism of the Great Barrier Reef. [103] The Australian government has had the goal of protecting this World Heritage Site since 1972 when they created The Australian Institute of Marine Science. [104] The Australian and Queensland governments have contributed about $142.5 million to their National Environmental Science Program which is how they've collected much of their data regarding threats to the Great Barrier Reef. [104] In addition, the Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan was announced in 2018 in order to help transition local communities, agricultural organizations and industries to more sustainable practices. [105] This plan will join the Queensland government and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to manage the amounts of runoff that reach the Great Barrier Reef as well as mitigating crown-of-thorns starfish population flare-ups. [105] The Great Barrier Reef has long been known to and used by the Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Aboriginal Australians have been living in the area for at least 40,000 years, [106] and Torres Strait Islanders since about 10,000 years ago. [107] For these 70 or so clan groups , the reef is also an important cultural feature. [108] In 1768 Louis de Bougainville found the reef during an exploratory mission, but did not claim the area for the French. [109] On 11 June 1770, HM Bark Endeavour , captained by explorer James Cook , ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef, sustaining considerable damage. Lightening the ship and re-floating it during an incoming tide eventually saved it. [110] One of the most famous wrecks was HMS Pandora , which sank on 29 August 1791, killing 35 men. The Queensland Museum has led archaeological digs to wreck of Pandora since 1983. [111] Because the reef had no atolls, it was largely unstudied in the 19th century. [28] : 7 During this time, some of the reef's islands were mined for deposits of guano , and lighthouses were built as beacons throughout the system. [28] : 452 as in Raine Island , the earliest example. [112] In 1922, the Great Barrier Reef Committee began carrying out much of the early research on the reef. [28] : 9 Royal Commissions disallowed oil drilling in the Great Barrier Reef, in 1975 the Government of Australia created the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and prohibited various activities. [113] The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park does not include the entire Great Barrier Reef Province. [25] The park is managed, in partnership with the Government of Queensland , through the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to ensure that it is used in a sustainable manner. A combination of zoning , management plans, permits, education and incentives (such as eco-tourism certification) are employed in the effort to conserve the reef. [57] [114] In 1999, the Australian Parliament passed the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act , which improved the operation of national environmental law by providing guidance about regional biodiversity conservation priorities. The marine bioregional planning process came from the implementation of this law. This process conserves marine biodiversity by considering the whole ecosystem a species is in and how different species interact in the marine environment. There are two steps to this process. The first step is to identify regional conservation priorities in the five (currently) different marine regions. The second step is to identify marine reserves (protected areas or marine parks) to be added to Australia's National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas. Like protected areas on land, marine reserves are created to protect biodiversity for generations to come. Marine reserves are identified based on criteria written in a document created by Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council called \"Guidelines for establishing the national representative system of marine protected areas\", also known as just \"the Guidelines\". These guidelines are nationally recognised and implemented at the local level based on the Australian policy for implementation outlined in the \"Goals and Principles for the Establishment of the National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas in Commonwealth Waters\". These policies are in place to make sure that a marine reserve is only added to the NRSMPA after careful evaluation of different data. The priorities for each region are created based on human and environmental threats and the Marine Bioregional Plans are drafted to address these priorities. To assess different region's priorities, three steps are taken, first, a bioregional profile is created, second, a bioregional plan is drafted, and third, the plan is finalised. After the plan is finalised, activity in different bioregions may become limited based on particular threats an activity may pose. [115] In 2001, the GBRMPA released a report about the declining water quality in the Great Barrier Reef and detailed the importance of this issue. In response to this report, in 2003, the Australian and Queensland governments launched a joint initiative to improve the quality of water entering the Great Barrier Reef. [116] The decline in the quality of water over the past 150 years (due to development) has contributed to coral bleaching, algal blooms , and pesticide pollution . These forms of pollution have made the reef less resilient to climate change. When the plan was introduced in October 2003, it originally contained 65 actions built on previous legislation. Their immediate goal was to halt and reverse the decline in water quality entering the reef by 2013. By 2020, they hope that the quality of the water entering in the reef improves enough so that it doesn't have a detrimental impact on the health of the Great Barrier Reef. To achieve these goals they decided to reduce pollutants in the water entering the reef and to rehabilitate and conserve areas of the reef that naturally help reduce water pollutants. To achieve the objectives described above, this plan focuses on non-point sources of pollution, which cannot be traced to a single source such as a waste outlet. The plan specifically targets nutrients, pesticides and sediment that make their way into the reef as a result of agricultural activities. Other non-point sources of pollution that are attributed to urban areas are covered under different legislation. In 2009, the plan was updated. The updated version states that to date, none of the efforts undertaken to improve the quality of water entering the reef has been successful. The new plan attempts to address this issue by \"targeting priority outcomes, integrating industry and community initiatives and incorporating new policy and regulatory frameworks (Reef Plan 5)\". This updated version has improved the clarity of the previous plan and targets set by that plan, have improved accountability and further improved monitoring and assessment. The 2009 report found that 41 out of the 65 actions met their original goals, however, 18 were not progressing well according to evaluation criteria as well as 6 were rated as having unsatisfactory levels of progress. Some key achievements made since the plan's initial passing in 2003 were the establishment of the Reef Quality Partnership to set targets, report findings and monitor progress towards targets, improved land condition by landowners was rewarded with extended leases, Water Quality Improvement Plans were created to identify regional targets and identified management changes that needed to be made to reach those targets, Nutrient Management Zones have been created to combat sediment loss in particular areas, education programs have been started to help gather support for sustainable agriculture, changes to land management practices have taken place through the implementation of the Farm Management Systems and codes of practice, the creation of the Queensland Wetland program and other achievements were made to help improve the water quality flowing into the coral reefs. A taskforce of scientists was also created to assess the impact of different parts of the plan on the quality of water flowing into the coral reefs. They found that many of the goals have yet to be reached but found more evidence that states that improving the water quality of the Great Barrier Reef will improve its resilience to climate change. The Reefocus summit in 2008, which is also detailed in the report, came to similar conclusions. After this, a stakeholder working group was formed that worked between several groups as well as the Australian and Queensland governments to update reef goals and objectives. The updated version of the plan focuses on strategic priority areas and actions to achieve 2013 goals. Also quantitative targets have been made to critically assess whether targets are being met. Some examples of the water quality goals outlined by this plan are that by 2013, there will be a 50% reduction in nitrogen and phosphorus loads at the end of catchments and that by 2020, there will be a reduction in sediment load by 20%. The plan also outlines a number of steps that must be taken by landholders to help improve grazing, soil, nutrient, and chemical management practices. There are also a number of supporting initiatives to take place outlined in the plan to help create a framework to improve land use practices which will in turn improve water quality. Through these means the governments of Australia and Queensland hope to improve water quality by 2013. The 2013 outlook report and revised water quality plan will assess what needs to be done in the future to improve water quality and the livelihoods of the wildlife that resides there. [117] In July 2004, a new zoning plan took effect for the entire Marine Park, and has been widely acclaimed as a new global benchmark for marine ecosystem conservation. [118] The rezoning was based on the application of systematic conservation planning techniques, using marxan software. [119] While protection across the Marine Park was improved, the highly protected zones increased from 4.5% to over 33.3%. [120] At the time, it was the largest Marine Protected Area in the world, although in 2006, the new Northwestern Hawaiian Islands National Monument became the largest. [121] In 2006, a review of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act of 1975 recommended that there should be no further zoning plan changes until 2013, and that every five years, a peer-reviewed outlook report should be published, examining the reef's health, management, and environmental pressures. [5] [122] In each outlook report, several assessments are required. Each assessment has a set of assessment criteria that allows for better presentation of available evidence. Each assessment is judged by these criteria and given a grade. Every outlook report follows the same judging and grading process so that information can be tracked over time. No new research is done to produce the report. Only readily available information goes into the report so little of what is known about the Reef is actually featured in each outlook report. [123] In December 2013, Greg Hunt , the Australian environment minister , approved a plan for dredging to create three shipping terminals as part of the construction of a coalport. According to corresponding approval documents, the process will create around 3 million cubic metres of dredged seabed that will be dumped within the Great Barrier Reef marine park area. [124] On 31 January 2014, the GBRMPA issued a dumping permit that will allow three million cubic metres of sea bed from Abbot Point , north of Bowen, to be transported and unloaded in the waters of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Potential significant harms have been identified in relation to dredge spoil and the process of churning up the sea floor in the area and exposing it to air: firstly, new research shows the finer particles of dredge spoil can cloud the water and block sunlight, thereby starving sea grass and coral up to distances of 80 km away from the point of origin due to the actions of wind and currents. Furthermore, dredge spoil can literally smother reef or sea grass to death, while storms can repeatedly resuspend these particles so that the harm caused is ongoing; secondly, disturbed sea floor can release toxic substances into the surrounding environment. [125] The dredge spoil from the Abbot Point port project is to be dumped 24 kilometres (15 mi) away, near Bowen in north Queensland, and the approval from the Authority will result in the production of an extra 70 million tonnes of coal annually, worth between A$1.4 billion and $2.8 billion. [125] Authority chairman, Dr Russell Reichelt, stated after the confirmation of the approval: This approval is in line with the agency's view that port development along the Great Barrier Reef coastline should be limited to existing ports. As a deepwater port that has been in operation for nearly 30 years, Abbot Point is better placed than other ports along the Great Barrier Reef coastline to undertake expansion as the capital and maintenance dredging required will be significantly less than what would be required in other areas. It's important to note the seafloor of the approved disposal area consists of sand, silt and clay and does not contain coral reefs or seagrass beds. [125] The approval was provided with a corresponding set of 47 new environmental conditions that include the following: A long-term water quality monitoring plan extending five years after the disposal activity is completed. A heritage management plan to protect the Catalina second world war aircraft wreck in Abbot Bay. The establishment of an independent dredging and disposal technical advice panel and a management response group, to include community representatives. [125] [126] The Australian Federal Government announced on 13 November that there would now be a ban on the dumping of dredge spoil in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The World Heritage Committee asked Environment Minister Greg Hunt to investigate alternative options to dump on land instead. The Queensland government and the Commonwealth have now accepted the alternative option and advice from The World Heritage Committee and will now commence dumping on land. [127] Due to its vast biodiversity , warm clear waters and accessibility from the tourist boats called \" live aboards \", the reef is a very popular destination, especially for scuba divers . Tourism on the Great Barrier Reef is concentrated in Cairns and also The Whitsundays due to their accessibility. These areas make up 7%\u20138% of the park's area. [57] The Whitsundays and Cairns have their own Plans of Management. [128] Many cities along the Queensland coast offer daily boat trips. Several continental and coral cay islands are now resorts , including Green Island and Lady Elliot Island . As of 1996, 27 islands on the Great Barrier Reef supported resorts. [57] In 1996, most of the tourism in the region was domestically generated and the most popular visiting times were during the Australian winter. At this time, it was estimated that tourists to the Great Barrier Reef contributed A$ 776 million per annum. [129] As the largest commercial activity in the region, it was estimated in 2003 that tourism generated over A$4 billion annually, [130] and the 2005 estimate increased to A$5.1 billion. [128] A Deloitte report published by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in March 2013 states that the Reef's 2,000 kilometres of coastline attracts tourism worth A$6.4 billion annually and employs more than 64,000 people. [131] Approximately two million people visit the Great Barrier Reef each year. [132] Although most of these visits are managed in partnership with the marine Tourism industry, there is a concern among the general public that tourism is harmful to the Great Barrier Reef. [57] A variety of boat tours and cruises are offered, from single day trips, to longer voyages. Boat sizes range from dinghies to superyachts . [133] Glass-bottomed boats and underwater observatories are also popular, as are helicopter flights. [134] [135] By far, the most popular tourist activities on the Great Barrier Reef are snorkelling and diving, for which pontoons are often used, and the area is often enclosed by nets. The outer part of the Great Barrier Reef is favoured for such activities, due to water quality. [ citation needed ] Management of tourism in the Great Barrier Reef is geared towards making tourism ecologically sustainable . A daily fee is levied that goes towards research of the Great Barrier Reef. [128] This fee ends up being 20% of the GBRMPA's income. [136] Policies on cruise ships , bareboat charters , and anchorages limit the traffic on the Great Barrier Reef. [128] The problems that surround ecotourism in the Great Barrier Reef revolve around permanent tourism platforms. Platforms are large, ship-like vessels that act as a base for tourists while scuba diving and snorkelling in the Great Barrier Reef. Seabirds will land on the platforms and defecate which will eventually be washed into the sea. The feces carry nitrogen, phosphorus and often DDT and mercury , which cause aspergillosis , yellow-band disease , and black band disease . Areas without tourism platforms have 14 out of 9,468 (1.1%) diseased corals versus areas with tourism platforms that have 172 out of 7,043 (12%) diseased corals. [137] Tourism is a major economic activity for the region. Thus, while non-permanent platforms could be possible in some areas, overall, permanent platforms are likely a necessity. Solutions have been suggested to siphon bird waste into gutters connecting to tanks helping lower runoff that causes coral disease. [138] The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has also placed many permanent anchorage points around the general use areas. These act to reduce damage to the reef due to anchoring destroying soft coral, chipping hard coral, and disturbing sediment as it is dragged across the bottom. Tourism operators also must comply with speed limits when travelling to or from tourist destinations, to prevent excessive wake from the boats disturbing the reef ecosystem. [ citation needed ] The fishing industry in the Great Barrier Reef, controlled by the Queensland Government, is worth A$ 1 billion annually. [15] It employs approximately 2000 people, and fishing in the Great Barrier Reef is pursued commercially, for recreation, and as a traditional means for feeding one's family.

It is located in Crystal Lake , Cunningham County, New Jersey (previously Forrest Green County and Wessex County). Camp Crystal Lake is most famous for being the home of serial killer Jason Voorhees .\nCamp Crystal Lake was established in 1935, by the Christy family , and operated peacefully until the summer of 1957; which was when Pamela Voorhees was hired at the camp as a cook, while her deformed son, Jason, was in attendance. Jason was bullied and harassed by other children at the camp. One day, while the counselors weren't supervising Jason, the other children threw him into the lake. Unable to swim, Jason presumably drowned. Hoping to avoid a scandal, the Christys closed the camp for the season to allow for an investigation. Authorities determined Jason's death was an accident.\nThe camp reopened in 1958, and Pamela was rehired by the Christys. Counselors Barry Jackson and Claudette Hayes , whom Pamela blamed for Jason's drowning, were also rehired for the year. Pamela, seeking revenge, murdered Barry and Claudette one night as they were preparing to have sex. These murders could not be covered up nor deemed as accidental deaths, so the Christys shut down the camp indefinitely. Pamela was never suspected, and the police ruled the homicides of Claudette and Barry as unsolved.\nThere were apparently multiple attempts to reopen Camp Crystal Lake throughout the 1960s. It is unknown if the Christys made these attempts or if the camp had changed hands. However, none of these attempts succeeded. A series of fires in 1959 prevented the summer debut, as did the discovery of poisoned water in 1962. Although it was never known who the perpetrator was, Pamela was the culprit.

It is located in Crystal Lake , Cunningham County, New Jersey (previously Forrest Green County and Wessex County). Camp Crystal Lake is most famous for being the home of serial killer Jason Voorhees . Camp Crystal Lake was established in 1935, by the Christy family , and operated peacefully until the summer of 1957; which was when Pamela Voorhees was hired at the camp as a cook, while her deformed son, Jason, was in attendance. Jason was bullied and harassed by other children at the camp. One day, while the counselors weren't supervising Jason, the other children threw him into the lake. Unable to swim, Jason presumably drowned. Hoping to avoid a scandal, the Christys closed the camp for the season to allow for an investigation. Authorities determined Jason's death was an accident. The camp reopened in 1958, and Pamela was rehired by the Christys. Counselors Barry Jackson and Claudette Hayes , whom Pamela blamed for Jason's drowning, were also rehired for the year. Pamela, seeking revenge, murdered Barry and Claudette one night as they were preparing to have sex. These murders could not be covered up nor deemed as accidental deaths, so the Christys shut down the camp indefinitely. Pamela was never suspected, and the police ruled the homicides of Claudette and Barry as unsolved. There were apparently multiple attempts to reopen Camp Crystal Lake throughout the 1960s. It is unknown if the Christys made these attempts or if the camp had changed hands. However, none of these attempts succeeded. A series of fires in 1959 prevented the summer debut, as did the discovery of poisoned water in 1962. Although it was never known who the perpetrator was, Pamela was the culprit. Her sick mind, combined with her over-protectiveness of her son, had convinced her that the murder of Barry and Claudette was not vengeance served; she had to ensure that no other child would share Jason's fate. By living close by, Pamela kept a watchful eye to make certain the camp remained abandoned. This fueled local gossip that the camp was jinxed or on cursed ground, and local residents nicknamed it \"Camp Blood.\" Sometime in the 1970s, both Mr. and Mrs. Christy had died, reportedly broke and crazy.

Cunningham's seminal slasher. Here's EW's peek behind Camp Crystal Lake's curtain.\nCredit: Paramount Pictures\nA proper tour of the original Friday the 13th filming locations lies just 60 miles northwest of New York City in New Jersey, and a complete expedition of the film's sets can be managed by fans who want to dedicate a whole day to sightseeing. First stop: Hope. With a population of approximately 2,000 people, the township is a quaint locale that will truly enchant Friday fans, especially those imaginative enough to match up their surroundings with the scenes and camera angles used by Cunningham.\nFollowing the 1958 flashback sequence, which serves as Friday the 13th's creepy introduction to the mysterious murderer, fans join up with Crystal Lake's cook, Annie (Robbi Morgan), 22 years later in present-day 1980. Looking for directions to the camp, she enters a small diner/general store where she meets the kindly truck driver, Enos (Rex Everhart).\nFans can still visit the daytime diner (the nighttime one will come up later), which remains in its original location, but now exists as Hope Junction Antiques located at 331 High Street. Charles and Lisa Iulo own the antique shop, which was once a Hard Times Coffee Shop. Take the time to enjoy this jewel of tourism in its own right, but once Friday fans have soaked up the shop, they need only head to their left outside the store to continue their journey back to Camp Blood.\nTwo buildings down, fans can track Annie and Enos' path after he agrees to give her a ride, where the characters bump into Crazy Ralph (Walt Gorney). The two-story building, which is now an Era Burgdorff Realtors business, has been painted white, and it sits on the corner of Walnut St. and High St. next to a one-way road sign. And as devoted fans all know, that's where Ralph tries to warn Annie about her destination: \"It's got a death curse!\"\nCredit: Paramount Pictures\nAfter shrugging off Crazy Ralph, Enos does in fact give Annie a lift, but the truck driver drops off his passenger a ways away from Crystal Lake. The cook must proceed on foot the rest of the way, and, behind Annie, viewers will spot a graveyard with a wrought-iron gate. This is the Moravian Cemetery in Hope, NJ. The exterior set piece is only a three-minute walk west from Hope Junction Antiques on High Street and then onto Delaware Road. Once tourists are done taking in the eerie cemetery, it's onward to Blairstown, NJ to continue the Friday the 13th adventure.\nCredit: Paramount Pictures\nOnly a 12-minute drive north of the antiques store, on Hope Blairstown Road, fans will find the Blairstown Diner . This is where the new owner of Camp Crystal Lake, Steve Christy (Peter Brouwer), spent most of that fateful night back in June of 1980. Unfortunately, Christy made the mistake of returning to camp, and that's where he met his end at the hands of the vengeful Mrs. Voorhees. The Blairstown Diner proudly promotes the fact that the eating establishment was \"featured in Friday the 13th ,\" and both interior and exterior were shot at the restaurant. So if you happen to get hungry on your Friday fandom walking tour, stop in for an omelet or griddle .\nOnce fans finish up at the Blairstown Diner, they're only a three-minute walk north on Carhart Street, and there they can find the First National Bank building still standing brick-for-brick and column-for-column as it appeared in the film. This is part of Blairstown's famed historic district, and the FNB is where the exterior shots of Annie entering the daytime diner (aka the interior of Hope Junction Antiques) were filmed.\nThere are a number of Friday the 13th -related stops to make while visiting the historic district, and Roy's Hall is one such must-see. The non-profit offers special screenings of Friday the 13th each year, so if fans plan out their trips perfectly, they can tour all the film's sets and see one of the best slasher movies of all time while in Blairstown, too.\nCredit: Paramount Pictures\nAfter having a fantastic time visiting Hope and Blairstown, it's time for the main event, so jump in the car and head 12 minutes north on Shannon Road. Your destination is the Hardwick Township of New Jersey. Take a left on Sand Pond Road, and you'll find Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco . While Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco has hosted thousands of Boy Scout troops since its inception in 1927, it is also where the majority of Friday the 13th was filmed.\nCourtesy of Crystal Lake Tours , fans can visit Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco and explore nearly every square inch of Friday the 13th's Camp Blood, which is an interactive dream come true. Tourists are virtually transported back to 1958, and they'll practically hear Claudette (Debra S. Hayes) and Barry (Willie Adams) singing \"Michael\" in the fellowship hall all over again. According to the tour, Hayes and Adams were dating in real life, and Friday fanatics will even visit the very loft where Mrs. Voorhees did away with the lovebirds, as they have the honor of being the film's first victims.\nBack outside, fans will find the original Crystal Lake sign hanging approximately 20 to 30 feet away from a replica of the Jeep that both Steve Christy and Mrs. Voorhees drove during the movie. The filmmakers simply used two different license plates to distinguish between who the Jeep belonged in the film. Several crew and cast members even signed the infamous Jeep on its back gate, including Adrienne King, Robbi Morgan, Ari Lehman, and special effects extraordinaire Tom Savini .\nJust nearby, a lonely canoe floats on the water. The Friday the 13th soundtrack resonates in the background, and fans will wait and wonder if Jason (Lehman) will pop out of the lake like he did when he frightened poor Alice (King) in the movie.

Most diehard fans can recall the exact moment they fell in love with the horror film genre, with that memory paving the way for a lifetime of enjoyment. But the fun of being a scary movie fanatic doesn't have to stop when the credits roll. You can immerse yourself in the action (if you dare) by visiting the real filming locations where your favorite horror flicks came to life. Followers of Freddy Krueger can stroll down Genesee Avenue in Los Angeles and gaze at Nancy Thompson's $3 million Dutch Colonial , Stephen King fans can book their stay at the Stanley Hotel (aka the Overlook) in Estes Park, Colorado, and world travelers can even make the pilgrimage to Transylvania to visit Dracula's majestic stronghold inspiration of Bran Castle . But this story is for the Friday the 13th enthusiasts who want to saunter around the same campgrounds Mrs. Voorhees ( Betsy Palmer ) did in Sean S. Cunningham's seminal slasher. Here's EW's peek behind Camp Crystal Lake's curtain. Credit: Paramount Pictures A proper tour of the original Friday the 13th filming locations lies just 60 miles northwest of New York City in New Jersey, and a complete expedition of the film's sets can be managed by fans who want to dedicate a whole day to sightseeing. First stop: Hope. With a population of approximately 2,000 people, the township is a quaint locale that will truly enchant Friday fans, especially those imaginative enough to match up their surroundings with the scenes and camera angles used by Cunningham. Following the 1958 flashback sequence, which serves as Friday the 13th's creepy introduction to the mysterious murderer, fans join up with Crystal Lake's cook, Annie (Robbi Morgan), 22 years later in present-day 1980. Looking for directions to the camp, she enters a small diner/general store where she meets the kindly truck driver, Enos (Rex Everhart). Fans can still visit the daytime diner (the nighttime one will come up later), which remains in its original location, but now exists as Hope Junction Antiques located at 331 High Street. Charles and Lisa Iulo own the antique shop, which was once a Hard Times Coffee Shop. Take the time to enjoy this jewel of tourism in its own right, but once Friday fans have soaked up the shop, they need only head to their left outside the store to continue their journey back to Camp Blood. Two buildings down, fans can track Annie and Enos' path after he agrees to give her a ride, where the characters bump into Crazy Ralph (Walt Gorney). The two-story building, which is now an Era Burgdorff Realtors business, has been painted white, and it sits on the corner of Walnut St. and High St. next to a one-way road sign. And as devoted fans all know, that's where Ralph tries to warn Annie about her destination: \"It's got a death curse!\" Credit: Paramount Pictures After shrugging off Crazy Ralph, Enos does in fact give Annie a lift, but the truck driver drops off his passenger a ways away from Crystal Lake. The cook must proceed on foot the rest of the way, and, behind Annie, viewers will spot a graveyard with a wrought-iron gate. This is the Moravian Cemetery in Hope, NJ. The exterior set piece is only a three-minute walk west from Hope Junction Antiques on High Street and then onto Delaware Road. Once tourists are done taking in the eerie cemetery, it's onward to Blairstown, NJ to continue the Friday the 13th adventure. Credit: Paramount Pictures Only a 12-minute drive north of the antiques store, on Hope Blairstown Road, fans will find the Blairstown Diner . This is where the new owner of Camp Crystal Lake, Steve Christy (Peter Brouwer), spent most of that fateful night back in June of 1980. Unfortunately, Christy made the mistake of returning to camp, and that's where he met his end at the hands of the vengeful Mrs. Voorhees. The Blairstown Diner proudly promotes the fact that the eating establishment was \"featured in Friday the 13th ,\" and both interior and exterior were shot at the restaurant. So if you happen to get hungry on your Friday fandom walking tour, stop in for an omelet or griddle . Once fans finish up at the Blairstown Diner, they're only a three-minute walk north on Carhart Street, and there they can find the First National Bank building still standing brick-for-brick and column-for-column as it appeared in the film. This is part of Blairstown's famed historic district, and the FNB is where the exterior shots of Annie entering the daytime diner (aka the interior of Hope Junction Antiques) were filmed. There are a number of Friday the 13th -related stops to make while visiting the historic district, and Roy's Hall is one such must-see. The non-profit offers special screenings of Friday the 13th each year, so if fans plan out their trips perfectly, they can tour all the film's sets and see one of the best slasher movies of all time while in Blairstown, too. Credit: Paramount Pictures After having a fantastic time visiting Hope and Blairstown, it's time for the main event, so jump in the car and head 12 minutes north on Shannon Road. Your destination is the Hardwick Township of New Jersey. Take a left on Sand Pond Road, and you'll find Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco . While Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco has hosted thousands of Boy Scout troops since its inception in 1927, it is also where the majority of Friday the 13th was filmed. Courtesy of Crystal Lake Tours , fans can visit Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco and explore nearly every square inch of Friday the 13th's Camp Blood, which is an interactive dream come true. Tourists are virtually transported back to 1958, and they'll practically hear Claudette (Debra S. Hayes) and Barry (Willie Adams) singing \"Michael\" in the fellowship hall all over again. According to the tour, Hayes and Adams were dating in real life, and Friday fanatics will even visit the very loft where Mrs. Voorhees did away with the lovebirds, as they have the honor of being the film's first victims. Back outside, fans will find the original Crystal Lake sign hanging approximately 20 to 30 feet away from a replica of the Jeep that both Steve Christy and Mrs. Voorhees drove during the movie. The filmmakers simply used two different license plates to distinguish between who the Jeep belonged in the film. Several crew and cast members even signed the infamous Jeep on its back gate, including Adrienne King, Robbi Morgan, Ari Lehman, and special effects extraordinaire Tom Savini . Just nearby, a lonely canoe floats on the water. The Friday the 13th soundtrack resonates in the background, and fans will wait and wonder if Jason (Lehman) will pop out of the lake like he did when he frightened poor Alice (King) in the movie. Next, take a gander over to the Price Lodge, aka the Shower House, to see where Marcie (Jeannine Taylor) was slain by the killer. The one sink where Marcie brushed her teeth remains, as does the lone light fixture that the murder weapon clanged against in the film. Savini decided to use a real axe, and made sure it clanged so that audiences would know it was authentic. That gimmick made the terror all the more effective when Marcie slumped to her death with a separate (and fortunately fake axe) attached to her face via Savini's magnificent make-up effects. Jack's ( Kevin Bacon ) quarters have been dubbed by his girlfriend's name, Brenda's cabin, and the interior appears much the same way it did when Mrs. Voorhees stuck the arrow through his throat. Further along the tour, fans will find the main cabin feels like it came out of a time capsule, too, and one can almost hear Jack's breakfast sizzling when Bacon cooks up his own bacon in the film. Even the \"Comanche\" sign hanging outside the main cabin has been perfectly replicated from the movie. There will even be a chance to inspect the archery range where Brenda (Laurie Bartram) was shot down by Mrs. Voorhees, and a sign which reads \"Danger\" hangs in the same place Jason's mother left crooner Bing Crosby 's son, Harry Crosby, hanging out at the generator shed.

Spoiler Alert: We will be discussing several exciting and even scary plot points that occur throughout this movie as we talk about the various locations used in Friday the 13th\u2019s production. The year is 1957 and a young boy drowns in Crystal Lake. One year later, two people are murdered at the camp that was set up next to the lake, with the killer never found. Friday the 13th revolves around a group of young counselors who visit Camp Crystal Lake, hoping to refurbish the cabins and the surrounding facilities as they plan to reopen the camp to the public. As a thunderstorm nears the camp, the various counselors split up, and some attempt to finish up their tasks while others get comfortable with each other. One by one, the various counselors are singled out and killed by this mysterious killer through all sorts of heinous methods. With the counselors getting suspicious as to their missing friends, they decide to band together to look for the missing people. The mysterious killer gets more creative to eliminate the remaining counselors and does this by cutting off the power, cutting the phone lines, and scaring the remaining counselors by throwing the bodies of their deceased friends through windows. With the film nearing its end, it is revealed that the killer is Jason Voorhees\u2019 mother, who blames her son\u2019s death in 1957 on the counselors that weren\u2019t watching him. Mrs. Voorhees attempts to kill Alice Hardy, the last counselor alive, but fails and dies as a result. As Alice is exhausted from all the events that transpired, she falls asleep inside a canoe that drifts out to Crystal Lake, when suddenly the decomposing corpse of Jason Voorhees attacks her. She wakes up in a hospital and when her claims are verified, she realizes that Jason is still in Crystal Lake. The original Friday the 13th film showcased in 1980 was intended to be a standalone one and so, not a lot of the funds were put towards finding exotic locations. This led to a lot of the filming being done in New Jersey and the townships within the area. Most of the filming took place within Cunningham County, New Jersey, and as many would come to expect, Camp Crystal Lake is a fictional location. Although Camp Crystal Lake is a fictional creation, the original location for the filming of Friday the 13th took place at a camp in Hardwick called Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco. Many of the Friday the 13th film scenes were shot in areas that weren\u2019t too far from each other which means that if you happen to visit one, you could probably visit the rest of the locations where the shooting took place on the same day. For how popular Friday the 13th was, the main antagonist Jason Voorhees has only a few quick scenes in the movie. Blairstown, New Jersey At the beginning of the movie, the audience is presented with one of the six counselors who are supposed to visit Camp Crystal Lake, Annie. She is seen walking up to two gas pumps and then talking to the dog who\u2019s waiting by the pumps. She asks him, \u201cYou speak English? How far is it to Camp Crystal Lake?\u201d What comes off as a bright and sunny introduction soon turns dark however with the beginning of the film not having the same energy as the ending. The Friday the 13th film sets that were used in the introduction of the movie were set in Blairstown and although the gas pumps are no longer in their original location, various areas that were utilized before this scene can still be found today. In particular, the stone arches on Main Street that were featured in the 1980 film can still be visited today and to get there you can drive along the NJ-94 and then take a turn down Main Street. Along the street, you will be able to spot the stone arches used at the beginning of the film as well as several other locations used to show where Annie was walking at the beginning of the film. Walnut Street, Hope, New Jersey On the way to Camp Crystal Lake, Annie, along with the truck driver bump into the town\u2019s local \u201ccrazy man\u201d. Nicknamed Crazy Ralph, he asks Annie, \u201cYou\u2019re going to Camp Blood, ain\u2019t you?\u201d This irritates the truck driver who replies in turn and says, \u201cDammit Ralph, get outta here! Go on, get it! Leave people alone!\u201d This scene begins to paint an ominous picture of the camp and helps build anticipation for the additional scenes to come in the movie. Some of the filming locations on Friday the 13th were used as a one-time set and this scene is a great example of that. The first appearance of Crazy Ralph was filmed along the intersection of Walnut Street and High Street in the township of Hope in New Jersey. To get there, drive along Delaware Road which leads to High Street, and you\u2019ll be able to see the intersection where Crazy Ralph appeared as you drive by Walnut Street. Moravian Cemetery, Hope, New Jersey On the way to Camp Crystal Lake, Annie hitches a ride with the Truck Driver. While on the way to where he is going to drop her off, they discuss what Camp Crystal Lake will be like, to which Annie mentions that \u201cI\u2019ll be cooking for 50 kids and 10 staff.\u201d He then mentions that the camp is jinxed and that trying to reopen the camp will just be bad luck. However, as he drops Annie off at the cemetery, which is a rather gloomy foreshadowing of where the counselors will end up, he tells her, \u201cTake care of yourself kid!\u201d Moravian Cemetery was the location of the graveyard scene in Friday the 13th and is a surprisingly short distance away from the location where Crazy Ralph confronted Annie. To get to the graveyard. You can drive along Delaware Road and you\u2019ll be able to see the iconic Moravian Cemetery sign. Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco, Blairstown, New Jersey As the rest of the characters begin to show up at Camp Crystal Lake, we get to see the future targets of the mysterious killer. With three of the counselors rolling up in their pickup truck, they get out and help the camp director uproot a tree stump. As we are introduced to the main characters of this film, the camp director Steve Christy says, \u201cWelcome to Camp Crystal Lake.\u201d With these words, the three counselors' fates are sealed as misfortune brews in the distance. The location for Camp Crystal Lake is a real-life location named Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco which has been in operation since 1927, the oldest continually operating Scout camp in the state. While access to the camp is restricted, there are the occasional tours that occur on special dates, like Friday the 13th. This allows tourists and interested visitors to go on \u201cCrystal Lake Tours\u201d to visit the iconic set where many of Friday the 13th\u2019s action scenes took place. To get to the camp, drive along Sand Pond Road before turning into Nobebosco Road which leads to the famous camp. Diner in Blairstown, New Jersey Steve left the camp earlier in the day to get the supplies required for the coming reopening of the site. Before he heads back to the camp, which at this point is late at night, he stops by the diner in Crystal Lake and talks to the waitress. He mentions to her, \u201cI\u2019ve got six new counselors at camp.\u201d Unbeknownst to him, at this point, only 2 of the 6 counselors he hired to help are still alive at Camp Crystal Lake because of the unknown killer. He oddly refers to the counselors he hired as \u201cbabes in the woods\u201d to which he remembers that he urgently needs to return to the camp to find out how they\u2019re faring and quickly heads out of the diner. The diner used for this scene in Friday the 13th is still standing today, over 40 years after the film was made! The diner is located in Blairstown, where most of the film shooting in the introductory portion of the movie takes place. To get to the Blairstown diner, drive along NJ-94, and you\u2019ll be coming across the diner in no time. Turkey Swamp Park, Freehold, New Jersey Just when you think everything is over, with the main antagonist of the film dead, Alice falls asleep in a canoe that drifts out to the middle of Crystal Lake where Jason Voorhees died many years earlier. As the police call out to a freshly woken up Alice, she suddenly gets grabbed by the decomposing body of Jason Voorhees who tries to drag her into the water. She wakes up in a cold sweat at a hospital. The doctor present reassures her, \u201cIt\u2019s all over. Everything\u2019s over.\u201d This makes Alice anxious as she mentions, \u201cThen he\u2019s still there.\u201d She\u2019s indicating that Jason still haunts the campground\u2019s lake. While most of the shooting took place at No-Be-Bo-Sco, the final sequence where Jason grabs Alice takes place at Turkey Swamp Park in Freehold. To get to the location where the final scene took place, you can drive along Georgia Road and then take a turn into Turkey Swamp Park Road. With almost all the counselors gone in the first film of Friday the 13th, many wondered if any more counselors would befall the same fate. This led to many sequels with the Friday the 13th franchise amassing 13 films throughout the years and solidifying its status as a classic horror genre defining franchise. The following films not only explore the lore behind Camp Crystal Lake but also introduce new and exciting scenes for the new antagonist, Jason Voorhees, to appear. This movie inspired a whole new genre of slash horror films and created the classic \u201cfinal girl\u201d trope which we still see in some movies today. So be sure that the next time you\u2019re in and around the New Jersey area, make a stop and visit the famous Friday the 13th filming locations!", "documentFile": "https://giggster.com/guide/movie-location/where-was-friday-the-13th-filmed"}, {"source_title": "The 1980 Slasher Movie 'Friday the 13th' Was Filmed at This Boy Scout Camp in New Jersey", "source_content_title": null, "source_date": "2003-01-01", "source_author": null, "documentText": ["Off a woodsy dirt road in the Kittatinny Mountain region of northwestern New Jersey, in tiny Sand Pond, a silver canoe is anchored in the exact spot where Jason Voorhees made his first appearance at the end of the 1980 slasher film Friday the 13th .", "\nFrom my vantage point, the lake, the shore, the canoes racked on the sandy beach, and the rustic log cabins look almost exactly as they did at Camp Crystal Lake, the fictional setting where a group of teens fell to a mysterious murderer stalking counselors in the woods.", "I can picture a muddy, decomposing Jason popping up, capsizing the canoe and pulling Alice\u2014the last girl standing in the movie\u2019s killing spree, played by Adrienne King\u2014under the water in the film\u2019s final jump scare.", "\nIt hits me: \u201cI really am at Camp Crystal Lake!\u201d", "\nYes, Camp Crystal Lake\u2014chillingly and informally referred to as \u201cCamp Blood\u201d in director Sean S.

Here, my tour guide tells our group, producers of Friday the 13th found the perfect backdrop, with its aging camp and swampy body of water, for their creepy story.\nIn real life, the campground is called Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco , which stands for North Bergen Boy Scouts. The nearly century-old, 380-acre Boy Scout camp in Hardwick is run by the Boy Scouts of America Northern New Jersey Council. For about two months every summer, campers take part in weeklong sessions, involving activities like swimming, canoeing and crafts.\nThe camp is off limits to the public during this time, of course. But every spring, early and late summer, and fall, a company run by Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco alumni called Crystal Lake Adventures brings in Friday the 13th props, signs and memorabilia\u2014sometimes even the stars themselves, like King. The outfit has been leading tours since 2011.\nA hardcore child of the \u201880s and fan of Generation X campy horror flicks, I never outgrew my teenage tastes. I remember the first time I saw Friday the 13th , and later the rest of the franchise, with nostalgia. The plot goes like this: A young boy drowns at Camp Crystal Lake during the 1950s, and the camp is now cursed; a year later, two camp counselors are brutally murdered. After this flashback opening scene, the film jumps ahead to Friday, June 13, 1980. Camp Crystal Lake is preparing to reopen, despite the death curse rumored to haunt it still more than two decades after the murders, and several teens report to work as counselors. A vengeful slasher, who viewers don\u2019t see until the last 20 minutes of the movie, lurks in the woods and kills the teens one by one. In a big shocker\u2014spoiler alert for those who haven\u2019t seen the movie\u2014the killer is a woman named Mrs. Voorhees, a former camp employee and the mother of Jason, the boy who drowned, seeking revenge.\nI nabbed a spot on a three-hour, daytime tour in mid-September\u2014a bucket-list experience for me. Tourists were split into two groups, about a dozen people each. The fans were mostly middle-aged Generation Xers, but there were some younger adults, along with one elderly woman whose middle-aged kids talked her into going on the tour.\nThe staff at Crystal Lake Adventures do not do media interviews or allow any commercial photography. My tour guide said events always sell out quickly, and word-of-mouth among Friday the 13th fans provides plenty of publicity. But while the tour operators were mysteriously mum, horror legend Tom Savini, who created the special effects for Friday the 13th and numerous other scary movies, thankfully shared behind-the-scenes anecdotes about the movie\u2019s monthlong filming session in 1979.\nSavini and his assistant, Taso N. Stavrakis, bunked in the cabins at Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco during filming, while other crew and cast members stayed in nearby hotels. Living at the camp was a blast, Savini recalls on a phone call, and the two passed their downtime riding motorcycles through the woods, and watching movies like Marathon Man and Barbarella on Betamax, a rival of VHS.\nSavini loved creating classic special effects before the modern era of CGI\u2014especially for the most creative and bloody kill scenes in Friday the 13th , like counselor Jack\u2019s arrow-in-the-throat execution and Marcie\u2019s ax in the face. Unlike with CGI, old-fashioned horror scenes require fake blood that needs to be cleaned up.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a magic trick happening right in front of your very eyes,\u201d Savini says. \u201cWe\u2019re training new generations to accept the CGI stuff, and they don\u2019t know the difference.\u201d\nAt the time of Friday the 13th , Savini thought this was just a one-time, low-budget horror movie about a murderous mother killing camp counselors because her son drowned. Savini intended his lake scene with Jason\u2014inspired by the ending of the 1977 horror film Carrie , where a hand pops out of a grave\u2014to be a dream sequence. But the movie\u2019s success\u2014it grossed nearly $60 million worldwide\u2014made a sequel irresistible. Producers came up with the idea of bringing Jason back as an adult killer in the second movie and asked Savini to participate, but he walked, thinking the concept was silly and implausible.\n\u201cI turned it down because I thought it was stupid,\u201d Savini says. \u201cI turned down part two because they had Jason running around\u2026. He came out of the lake and lived off crayfish for many years?\u201d\nSavini returned for Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter in 1984. The fourth movie truly intended to kill Jason off, Savini says. But money talks, and the franchise continued with a copycat killer in the fifth movie, and a chronically resurrected Jason in the next five Jason films, plus Freddy vs. Jason in 2003. In 2009, a remake of Friday the 13th was released.\n\u201cI felt like Dr. Frankenstein,\u201d jokes Savini. \u201cI created this monster in part one, and I got to kill him in part four.\u201d\nThe tour begins in the dining hall, site of Friday the 13th \u2019s opening flashback scene, where camp counselors sing campfire songs in 1958. The small part of the dining hall we see in the movie looks just the same, with two benches and a guitar standing by the fireplace to jog visitors\u2019 memory of the scene. Some fans wander to the gift shop next door, eyeing Camp Crystal Lake yellow rain slickers just like those the characters wore and \u201cAngry Mother Bottling Co.\u201d jugs filled with souvenir water from the lake. Others pose for selfies in front of the Camp Crystal Lake sign or a green Jeep autographed by cast members, before we break off into smaller groups.\nThe Jeep is a replica of the 1966 CJ-5 that the wicked Mrs. Voorhees drives in the movie.

She is a former staff writer for the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, The Associated Press and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram .", "source_raw_text": "Off a woodsy dirt road in the Kittatinny Mountain region of northwestern New Jersey, in tiny Sand Pond, a silver canoe is anchored in the exact spot where Jason Voorhees made his first appearance at the end of the 1980 slasher film Friday the 13th . From my vantage point, the lake, the shore, the canoes racked on the sandy beach, and the rustic log cabins look almost exactly as they did at Camp Crystal Lake, the fictional setting where a group of teens fell to a mysterious murderer stalking counselors in the woods. I can picture a muddy, decomposing Jason popping up, capsizing the canoe and pulling Alice\u2014the last girl standing in the movie\u2019s killing spree, played by Adrienne King\u2014under the water in the film\u2019s final jump scare.  It hits me: \u201cI really am at Camp Crystal Lake!\u201d  Yes, Camp Crystal Lake\u2014chillingly and informally referred to as \u201cCamp Blood\u201d in director Sean S. Cunningham\u2019s Friday the 13th \u2014is a real-life place you can tour, along with several other filming spots in the surrounding area of Warren County, New Jersey, not far from the Pennsylvania border. Here, my tour guide tells our group, producers of Friday the 13th found the perfect backdrop, with its aging camp and swampy body of water, for their creepy story. In real life, the campground is called Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco , which stands for North Bergen Boy Scouts. The nearly century-old, 380-acre Boy Scout camp in Hardwick is run by the Boy Scouts of America Northern New Jersey Council. For about two months every summer, campers take part in weeklong sessions, involving activities like swimming, canoeing and crafts.  The camp is off limits to the public during this time, of course. But every spring, early and late summer, and fall, a company run by Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco alumni called  Crystal Lake Adventures  brings in  Friday the 13th  props, signs and memorabilia\u2014sometimes even the stars themselves, like King. The outfit has been leading tours since 2011.  A hardcore child of the \u201880s and fan of Generation X campy horror flicks, I never outgrew my teenage tastes. I remember the first time I saw Friday the 13th , and later the rest of the franchise, with nostalgia. The plot goes like this: A young boy drowns at Camp Crystal Lake during the 1950s, and the camp is now cursed; a year later, two camp counselors are brutally murdered. After this flashback opening scene, the film jumps ahead to Friday, June 13, 1980. Camp Crystal Lake is preparing to reopen, despite the death curse rumored to haunt it still more than two decades after the murders, and several teens report to work as counselors. A vengeful slasher, who viewers don\u2019t see until the last 20 minutes of the movie, lurks in the woods and kills the teens one by one. In a big shocker\u2014spoiler alert for those who haven\u2019t seen the movie\u2014the killer is a woman named Mrs. Voorhees, a former camp employee and the mother of Jason, the boy who drowned, seeking revenge. I nabbed a spot on a three-hour, daytime tour in mid-September\u2014a bucket-list experience for me. Tourists were split into two groups, about a dozen people each. The fans were mostly middle-aged Generation Xers, but there were some younger adults, along with one elderly woman whose middle-aged kids talked her into going on the tour. The staff at Crystal Lake Adventures do not do media interviews or allow any commercial photography. My tour guide said events always sell out quickly, and word-of-mouth among Friday the 13th fans provides plenty of publicity. But while the tour operators were mysteriously mum, horror legend Tom Savini, who created the special effects for Friday the 13th and numerous other scary movies, thankfully shared behind-the-scenes anecdotes about the movie\u2019s monthlong filming session in 1979. Savini and his assistant, Taso N. Stavrakis, bunked in the cabins at Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco during filming, while other crew and cast members stayed in nearby hotels. Living at the camp was a blast, Savini recalls on a phone call, and the two passed their downtime riding motorcycles through the woods, and watching movies like Marathon Man and Barbarella on Betamax, a rival of VHS. Savini loved creating classic special effects before the modern era of CGI\u2014especially for the most creative and bloody kill scenes in Friday the 13th , like counselor Jack\u2019s arrow-in-the-throat execution and Marcie\u2019s ax in the face. Unlike with CGI, old-fashioned horror scenes require fake blood that needs to be cleaned up.  \u201cIt\u2019s a magic trick happening right in front of your very eyes,\u201d Savini says. \u201cWe\u2019re training new generations to accept the CGI stuff, and they don\u2019t know the difference.\u201d  At the time of Friday the 13th , Savini thought this was just a one-time, low-budget horror movie about a murderous mother killing camp counselors because her son drowned. Savini intended his lake scene with Jason\u2014inspired by the ending of the 1977 horror film Carrie , where a hand pops out of a grave\u2014to be a dream sequence. But the movie\u2019s success\u2014it grossed nearly $60 million worldwide\u2014made a sequel irresistible. Producers came up with the idea of bringing Jason back as an adult killer in the second movie and asked Savini to participate, but he walked, thinking the concept was silly and implausible. \u201cI turned it down because I thought it was stupid,\u201d Savini says. \u201cI turned down part two because they had Jason running around\u2026. He came out of the lake and lived off crayfish for many years?\u201d Savini returned for Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter in 1984. The fourth movie truly intended to kill Jason off, Savini says. But money talks, and the franchise continued with a copycat killer in the fifth movie, and a chronically resurrected Jason in the next five Jason films, plus Freddy vs. Jason in 2003. In 2009, a remake of Friday the 13th was released. \u201cI felt like Dr. Frankenstein,\u201d jokes Savini. \u201cI created this monster in part one, and I got to kill him in part four.\u201d The tour begins in the dining hall, site of Friday the 13th \u2019s opening flashback scene, where camp counselors sing campfire songs in 1958. The small part of the dining hall we see in the movie looks just the same, with two benches and a guitar standing by the fireplace to jog visitors\u2019 memory of the scene. Some fans wander to the gift shop next door, eyeing Camp Crystal Lake yellow rain slickers just like those the characters wore and \u201cAngry Mother Bottling Co.\u201d jugs filled with souvenir water from the lake. Others pose for selfies in front of the Camp Crystal Lake sign or a green Jeep autographed by cast members, before we break off into smaller groups.  The Jeep is a replica of the 1966 CJ-5 that the wicked Mrs. Voorhees drives in the movie. The vehicle becomes a sinister character of its own; it appears in many scenes, though viewers can\u2019t see who is driving it. In a red herring, Camp Crystal Lake\u2019s owner Steve Christy drives a green Jeep; our guide tells us that the same car was used for both characters, but with different license plates.

a stick, the Bugcam could roll through grass and other terrain and send back an insect's-eye outlook.", "Lasseter was intrigued by the way grass, leaves, and flower petals formed a translucent canopy, as if the insects were living under a stained-glass ceiling.", "The team also later sought inspiration from Microcosmos (1996), a French documentary on love and violence in the insect world.", "[10]\nThe transition from treatment to storyboards took on an extra layer of complexity due to the profusion of storylines.", "Where Toy Story focused heavily on Woody and Buzz, with the other toys serving mostly as sidekicks, A Bug's Life required in-depth storytelling for several major groups of characters.", "[13] Character design also presented a new challenge, in that the designers had to make ants appear likable.", "Although the animators and the art department studied insects more closely, natural realism would give way to the film's larger needs.", "[14] The team took out mandibles and designed the ants to stand upright, replacing their normal six legs with two arms and two legs.", "The grasshoppers, in contrast, received a pair of extra appendages to appear less attractive.",

such shots in the ant colony, some with as many as 800.", "It was impractical for animators to control them individually, but neither could the ants remain static for even a moment without appearing lifeless, or move identically.", "Bill Reeves, one of the film's two supervising technical directors, dealt with the quandary by leading the development of software for autonomous ants.", "[14] The animators would only animate four or five groups of about eight individual \"universal ants\".", "Each one of these \"universal ants\" would later be randomly distributed throughout the digital set.", "The program also allowed each ant to be automatically modified in subtle ways (e.g. different color of eye or skin, different heights, different weights, etc.).", "This ensured that no two ants were the same.", "[18] It was partly based on Reeves's invention of particle systems a decade and a half earlier, which had let animators use masses of self-guided particles to create effects like swirling dust and snow.", "[15]\nThe animators also employed subsurface scattering \u2014developed by Pixar co-founder Edwin Catmull during his graduate student days at the University of Utah in the 1970s\u2014to render surfaces in a more lifelike way.", "This would be the first time that subsurface scattering would be used in a Pixar film, and a small team at Pixar worked out the practical problems that kept it from working in animation.", "Catmull asked for a short film to test and showcase subsurface scattering and the result, Geri's Game (1997), was attached alongside A Bug's Life in its theatrical release.", "[19]\nDuring the production of A Bug's Life , a public feud erupted between DreamWorks ' Jeffrey Katzenberg , and Pixar's Steve Jobs and John Lasseter.", "Katzenberg, former chairman of Disney's film division, had left the company in a bitter feud with CEO Michael Eisner.", "In response, he formed DreamWorks SKG with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen and planned to rival Disney in animation.", "[20] After DreamWorks' acquisition of Pacific Data Images (PDI)\u2014long Pixar's contemporary in computer animation\u2014Lasseter and others at Pixar were dismayed to learn from the trade papers that PDI's first project at DreamWorks would be another ant film, to be called Antz .", "[21] By this time, Pixar's project was well known within the animation community.", "[22] Both Antz and A Bug's Life center on a young male ant, a drone with oddball tendencies that struggles to win a princess's hand by saving their society.", "Whereas A Bug's Life relied chiefly on visual gags, Antz was more verbal and revolved more around satire.", "The script of Antz was also heavy with adult references, whereas Pixar's film was more accessible to children.", "[23]\nIt was clear that Lasseter and Jobs believed that the idea was stolen by Katzenberg.", "[8] [20] Katzenberg had stayed in touch with Lasseter after the acrimonious Disney split, often calling to check up.", "In October 1995, when Lasseter was overseeing postproduction work on Toy Story at the Universal lot's Technicolor facility in Universal City , where DreamWorks was also located, he called Katzenberg and dropped by with Stanton.", "[20] [24] When Katzenberg asked what they were doing next, Lasseter described what would become A Bug's Life in detail.", "Lasseter respected Katzenberg's judgment and felt comfortable using him as a sounding board for creative ideas.", "[24] Lasseter had high hopes for Toy Story , and he was telling friends throughout the tight-knit computer-animation business to get cracking on their own films.", "\"If this hits, it's going to be like space movies after Star Wars \" for computer animation companies, he told various friends.", "[8] \"I should have been wary,\" Lasseter later recalled.", "\"Jeffrey kept asking questions about when it would be released.\"", "[20]\nWhen the trades indicated production on Antz , Lasseter, feeling betrayed, called Katzenberg and asked him bluntly if it were true, who in turn asked him where he had heard the rumor.", "Lasseter asked again, and Katzenberg admitted it was true.", "Lasseter raised his voice and would not believe Katzenberg's story that a development director had pitched him the idea long ago.", "Katzenberg claimed Antz came from a 1991 story pitch by Tim Johnson that was related to Katzenberg in October 1994.", "[8]", "Another source gives Nina Jacobson , one of Katzenberg's executives, as the person responsible for the Antz pitch.", "[22] Lasseter, who normally did not use profane language, cursed at Katzenberg and hung up the phone.", "[25] Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg began explaining that Disney was \"out to get him\" and that he realized that he was just cannon fodder in Katzenberg's fight with Disney.", "[8] [22] For his part, Katzenberg believed he was the victim of a conspiracy: Eisner had decided not to pay him his contract-required bonus, convincing Disney's board not to give him anything.", "[22] Katzenberg was further angered by the fact that Eisner scheduled Bugs to open the same week as The Prince of Egypt , which was then intended to be DreamWorks' first animated release.", "[22] [25] Lasseter grimly relayed the news to Pixar employees but kept morale high.", "Privately, Lasseter told other Pixar executives that he and Stanton felt terribly let down by Katzenberg.", "[22]\nKatzenberg moved the opening of Antz from spring 1999 to October 1998 to compete with Pixar's release.", "[22] [26] David Price writes in his 2008 book The Pixar Touch that a rumor, \"never confirmed\", was that Katzenberg had given PDI \"rich financial incentives to induce them to whatever it would take to have Antz ready first, despite Pixar's head start\".", "[22] [25] Jobs was furious and called Katzenberg and began yelling.", "Katzenberg made an offer: He would delay production of Antz if Jobs and Disney would move A Bug's Life so that it did not compete with The Prince of Egypt .", "Jobs believed it \"a blatant extortion attempt \" and would not go for it, explaining that there was nothing he could do to convince Disney to change the date.", "[8] [25] Katzenberg casually responded that Jobs himself had taught him how to conduct similar business long ago, explaining that Jobs had come to Pixar's rescue by making the deal for Toy Story , as Pixar was near bankruptcy at that time.", "[15] \"I was the one guy there for you back then, and now you're allowing them to use you to screw me,\" Katzenberg said.", "[25] He suggested that if Jobs wanted to, he could simply slow down production on A Bug's Life without telling Disney.", "If he did, Katzenberg said, he would put Antz on hold.", "[8] Lasseter also claimed Katzenberg had phoned him with the proposition, but Katzenberg denied these charges later.", "[17]\nAs the release dates for both films approached, Disney executives concluded that Pixar should keep silent on the DreamWorks battle.", "Regardless, Lasseter publicly dismissed Antz as a \"schlock version\" of A Bug's Life .", "[19] Lasseter, who claimed to have never seen Antz , told others that if DreamWorks and PDI had made the film about anything other than insects, he would have closed Pixar for the day so the entire company could go see it.", "[8] [23] Jobs and Katzenberg would not back down and the rivaling ant films provoked a press frenzy.", "\"The bad guys rarely win,\" Jobs told the Los Angeles Times .", "In response, DreamWorks' head of marketing Terry Press suggested, \"Steve Jobs should take a pill.\"", "[25] Despite the successful box office performance of both Antz and A Bug's Life , tensions would remain high between Jobs and Katzenberg for many years.", "According to Jobs, Katzenberg came to Jobs after the success of Shrek (2001) and insisted he had never heard the pitch for A Bug's Life , reasoning that his settlement with Disney would have given him a share of the profits if that were so.",

It was the second feature-length film produced by Pixar. Directed by John Lasseter and co-directed by Andrew Stanton , the film involves a misfit ant, Flik, who is looking for \"tough warriors\" to save his colony from a protection racket run by a gang of grasshoppers. Unfortunately, the \"warriors\" he brings back turn out to be an inept troupe of Circus Bugs.\nThe film was initially inspired by Aesop 's fable The Ant and the Grasshopper . [3] [4] Production began shortly after the release of Toy Story in 1995. The screenplay was penned by Stanton and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, and Joe Ranft . The ants in the film were redesigned to be more appealing, and Pixar's animation unit employed technical innovations in computer animation. Randy Newman composed the music for the film. During production, a controversial public feud erupted between Steve Jobs and Lasseter of Pixar and DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg due to the parallel production of his similar film Antz , which was released the same year.\nThe film was released on November 20, 1998, received positive reviews and grossed $363 million at the box office. It was the first film to be digitally transferred frame-by-frame and released on DVD , and has been released multiple times on home video.\nA colony of ants, led by the elderly Queen and her daughter Princess Atta, lives in the middle of a seasonally dry creekbed on a small hill known as \"Ant Island\". Every summer, they are forced to give food to a gang of bullying grasshoppers, led by Hopper.\nOne day, a courageous but clumsy inventor ant named Flik inadvertently destroys the food offering with his grain harvester. Hopper discovers this, and demands twice as much food as compensation. When Flik earnestly suggests the ants enlist the help of bigger bugs to fight the grasshoppers, Atta sees it as a way to get rid of Flik and sends him off.\nFlik travels to \"the city\", a heap of trash under a trailer. Happening upon the aftermath of a chaotic bar fight, Flik mistakes a troupe of jobless Circus Bugs for the warrior bugs he seeks. The bugs, in turn, mistake Flik for a talent agent, and agree to travel with him back to Ant Island. During a welcome ceremony upon their arrival, the Circus Bugs and Flik discover their mutual misunderstandings. The Circus Bugs attempt to leave, but are pursued by a nearby bird; while fleeing, they rescue Atta's younger sister Dot from the bird, gaining the ants' respect. At Flik's request, the Circus Bugs continue the ruse of being \"warriors\", thus enabling them to continue enjoying the ants' hospitality. Learning that Hopper fears birds inspires Flik to build a crewed ornithopter disguised as a bird to scare away the grasshoppers. Meanwhile, Hopper reminds his gang of the ants' superior numbers, warning them the ants will rebel if not kept in line.\nThe ants finish constructing the fake bird. During the subsequent celebration, the Circus Bugs' old boss, P.T. Flea, arrives, seeking to rehire them and blowing their cover. The ants, angered to learn that Flik lied to them, exile him and the Circus Bugs, and desperately attempt to gather food for a new offering. Hopper returns and sees the mediocre offering; he takes over the island, and demands the ants' own winter food supply, planning to execute the Queen afterward. Overhearing the plan, Dot persuades Flik and the Circus Bugs to return to Ant Island.\nAfter the Circus Bugs distract the grasshoppers long enough to rescue the Queen, Flik deploys the bird. It initially fools the grasshoppers, but P.T., who is also fooled, sets the bird on fire. Realizing the deception, Hopper has Flik publicly beaten to teach the ants a lesson, proclaiming that the ants are lowly life forms who live solely to serve the grasshoppers. Flik asserts that Hopper actually fears the colony, because he has always known what they are capable of. This inspires the ants and the Circus Bugs to fight back against the grasshoppers, driving all but Hopper away.\nThe ants shove Hopper into the circus cannon to shoot him off of the island, but rain suddenly begins to fall. In the ensuing chaos, Hopper frees himself from the cannon and abducts Flik. The Circus Bugs and Atta pursue, with the latter catching up to Hopper and rescuing Flik. Flik lures Hopper to the real bird's nest; believing the bird is another fake, Hopper taunts it, until it grabs him and feeds him to its chicks.\nWith the anthill now at peace, Flik improves his inventions to help gather food for the ants. He and Atta become a couple, and send Hopper's affable brother Molt and a few ants to help P.T. and the Circus Bugs on their new tour. Atta and Dot become the new Queen and Princess, respectively.

[6] The storyline for A Bug's Life originated from a lunchtime conversation between John Lasseter , Andrew Stanton , Pete Docter , and Joe Ranft , the studio's head story team; other films such as Monsters, Inc. , Finding Nemo and WALL-E were also conceived at this lunch. [7] Lasseter and his story team had already been drawn to the idea of insects serving as characters. Like toys, insects were within the reach of computer animation back then, due to their relatively simple surfaces. Stanton and Ranft wondered whether they could find a starting point in Aesop's fable The Ant and the Grasshopper . [7] Walt Disney had produced his own version with a cheerier ending decades earlier in the 1934 short film The Grasshopper and the Ants . In addition, Walt Disney Feature Animation had considered producing a film in the late-1980s entitled Army Ants , that centered around a pacifist ant living in a militaristic colony, but this never fully materialized. [8]\nAs Stanton and Ranft discussed the adaptation, they rattled off scenarios and storylines springing from their premise. [7] Lasseter liked the idea and offered some suggestions. The concept simmered until early 1995, when the story team began work on the second film in earnest. [7] During an early test screening for Toy Story in San Rafael in June 1995, they pitched the film to Disney CEO Michael Eisner . Eisner thought the idea was fine and they submitted a treatment to Disney in early July under the title Bugs . [7] Disney approved the treatment and gave notice on July 7 that it was exercising the option of a second film under the original 1991 agreement between Disney and Pixar. [9] Lasseter assigned the co-director job to Stanton; both worked well together and had similar sensibilities. Lasseter had realized that working on a computer-animated feature as a sole director was dangerous while the production of Toy Story was in process. [9] In addition, Lasseter believed that it would relieve stress and that the role would groom Stanton for having his own position as a lead director. [10]\nIn The Ant and the Grasshopper , a grasshopper squanders the spring and summer months on singing while the ants put food away for the winter; when winter comes, the hungry grasshopper begs the ants for food, but the ants turn him away. [7] Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft hit on the notion that the grasshopper could just take the food. [7] [11] After Stanton had completed a draft of the script, he came to doubt one of the story's main pillars \u2013 that the Circus Bugs that had come to the colony to cheat the ants would instead stay and fight. [10] He thought the Circus Bugs were unlikable characters as liars and that it was unrealistic for them to undergo a complete personality change. Also, no particularly good reason existed for Circus Bugs to stay with the ant colony during the second act. [12] Although the film was already far along, Stanton concluded that the story needed a different approach. [10]\nStanton took one of the early circus bug characters, Red the red ant , and changed him into the character Flik. [12] The Circus Bugs, no longer out to cheat the colony, would be embroiled in a comic misunderstanding as to why Flik was recruiting them. Lasseter agreed with this new approach, and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw spent a few months working on further polishing with Stanton. [13] The characters \"Tuck and Roll\" were inspired by a drawing that Stanton did of two bugs fighting when he was in the second grade. [11] Lasseter had come to envision the film as an epic in the tradition of David Lean 's 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia . [12] [14]\nThe voice cast was heavy with television sitcom stars of the time: Flik was voiced by Dave Foley (from NewsRadio ), Princess Atta was voiced by Julia Louis-Dreyfus (from Seinfeld ), Molt was voiced by Richard Kind (from Spin City ), Slim was voiced by David Hyde Pierce (from Frasier ) and Dim was voiced by Brad Garrett (from Everybody Loves Raymond ). Joe Ranft , member of Pixar's story team, played Heimlich the caterpillar at the suggestion of Lasseter's wife, Nancy, who had heard him playing the character on a scratch vocal track. [15]\nThe casting of Hopper, the film's villain, proved problematic. Lasseter's top choice was Robert De Niro , who repeatedly turned the part down, as did a succession of other actors. [15] Kevin Spacey met John Lasseter at the 1995 Academy Awards and Lasseter asked Spacey if he would be interested in doing the voice of Hopper. Spacey was delighted and signed on immediately. [12]\nA Bug's Life was the final film appearance of actor Roddy McDowall , who played Mr. Soil, dying shortly before the film's theatrical release. [16]\nIt was more difficult for animators during the production of A Bug's Life than that of Toy Story , as computers ran sluggishly due to the complexity of the character models. Lasseter and Stanton had two supervising animators to assist with directing and reviewing the animation: Rich Quade and Glenn McQueen . [3] The first sequence to be animated and rendered was the circus sequence that culminated with P.T. Flea's \"Flaming Wall of Death\". Lasseter placed this scene first in the pipeline because he believed it was \"less likely to change\". [17] Lasseter thought it would be useful to look at a view of the world from an insect's perspective. Two technicians obliged by creating a miniature video camera on Lego wheels, which they dubbed as the \"Bugcam\". [10] [18] Fastened to the end of a stick, the Bugcam could roll through grass and other terrain and send back an insect's-eye outlook. Lasseter was intrigued by the way grass, leaves, and flower petals formed a translucent canopy, as if the insects were living under a stained-glass ceiling. The team also later sought inspiration from Microcosmos (1996), a French documentary on love and violence in the insect world. [10]\nThe transition from treatment to storyboards took on an extra layer of complexity due to the profusion of storylines. Where Toy Story focused heavily on Woody and Buzz, with the other toys serving mostly as sidekicks, A Bug's Life required in-depth storytelling for several major groups of characters. [13] Character design also presented a new challenge, in that the designers had to make ants appear likable. Although the animators and the art department studied insects more closely, natural realism would give way to the film's larger needs. [14] The team took out mandibles and designed the ants to stand upright, replacing their normal six legs with two arms and two legs. The grasshoppers, in contrast, received a pair of extra appendages to appear less attractive. [14] The story's scale also required software engineers to accommodate new demands. Among these was the need to handle shots with crowds of ants. [14] The film would include more than 400 such shots in the ant colony, some with as many as 800. It was impractical for animators to control them individually, but neither could the ants remain static for even a moment without appearing lifeless, or move identically. Bill Reeves, one of the film's two supervising technical directors, dealt with the quandary by leading the development of software for autonomous ants. [14] The animators would only animate four or five groups of about eight individual \"universal ants\". Each one of these \"universal ants\" would later be randomly distributed throughout the digital set. The program also allowed each ant to be automatically modified in subtle ways (e.g. different color of eye or skin, different heights, different weights, etc.). This ensured that no two ants were the same. [18] It was partly based on Reeves's invention of particle systems a decade and a half earlier, which had let animators use masses of self-guided particles to create effects like swirling dust and snow. [15]\nThe animators also employed subsurface scattering \u2014developed by Pixar co-founder Edwin Catmull during his graduate student days at the University of Utah in the 1970s\u2014to render surfaces in a more lifelike way. This would be the first time that subsurface scattering would be used in a Pixar film, and a small team at Pixar worked out the practical problems that kept it from working in animation. Catmull asked for a short film to test and showcase subsurface scattering and the result, Geri's Game (1997), was attached alongside A Bug's Life in its theatrical release. [19]\nDuring the production of A Bug's Life , a public feud erupted between DreamWorks ' Jeffrey Katzenberg , and Pixar's Steve Jobs and John Lasseter. Katzenberg, former chairman of Disney's film division, had left the company in a bitter feud with CEO Michael Eisner. In response, he formed DreamWorks SKG with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen and planned to rival Disney in animation. [20] After DreamWorks' acquisition of Pacific Data Images (PDI)\u2014long Pixar's contemporary in computer animation\u2014Lasseter and others at Pixar were dismayed to learn from the trade papers that PDI's first project at DreamWorks would be another ant film, to be called Antz . [21] By this time, Pixar's project was well known within the animation community. [22] Both Antz and A Bug's Life center on a young male ant, a drone with oddball tendencies that struggles to win a princess's hand by saving their society. Whereas A Bug's Life relied chiefly on visual gags, Antz was more verbal and revolved more around satire. The script of Antz was also heavy with adult references, whereas Pixar's film was more accessible to children. [23]\nIt was clear that Lasseter and Jobs believed that the idea was stolen by Katzenberg. [8] [20] Katzenberg had stayed in touch with Lasseter after the acrimonious Disney split, often calling to check up. In October 1995, when Lasseter was overseeing postproduction work on Toy Story at the Universal lot's Technicolor facility in Universal City , where DreamWorks was also located, he called Katzenberg and dropped by with Stanton. [20] [24] When Katzenberg asked what they were doing next, Lasseter described what would become A Bug's Life in detail. Lasseter respected Katzenberg's judgment and felt comfortable using him as a sounding board for creative ideas. [24] Lasseter had high hopes for Toy Story , and he was telling friends throughout the tight-knit computer-animation business to get cracking on their own films. \"If this hits, it's going to be like space movies after Star Wars \" for computer animation companies, he told various friends. [8] \"I should have been wary,\" Lasseter later recalled. \"Jeffrey kept asking questions about when it would be released.\" [20]\nWhen the trades indicated production on Antz , Lasseter, feeling betrayed, called Katzenberg and asked him bluntly if it were true, who in turn asked him where he had heard the rumor. Lasseter asked again, and Katzenberg admitted it was true. Lasseter raised his voice and would not believe Katzenberg's story that a development director had pitched him the idea long ago. Katzenberg claimed Antz came from a 1991 story pitch by Tim Johnson that was related to Katzenberg in October 1994. [8] Another source gives Nina Jacobson , one of Katzenberg's executives, as the person responsible for the Antz pitch. [22] Lasseter, who normally did not use profane language, cursed at Katzenberg and hung up the phone. [25] Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg began explaining that Disney was \"out to get him\" and that he realized that he was just cannon fodder in Katzenberg's fight with Disney. [8] [22] For his part, Katzenberg believed he was the victim of a conspiracy: Eisner had decided not to pay him his contract-required bonus, convincing Disney's board not to give him anything. [22] Katzenberg was further angered by the fact that Eisner scheduled Bugs to open the same week as The Prince of Egypt , which was then intended to be DreamWorks' first animated release. [22] [25] Lasseter grimly relayed the news to Pixar employees but kept morale high. Privately, Lasseter told other Pixar executives that he and Stanton felt terribly let down by Katzenberg. [22]\nKatzenberg moved the opening of Antz from spring 1999 to October 1998 to compete with Pixar's release. [22] [26] David Price writes in his 2008 book The Pixar Touch that a rumor, \"never confirmed\", was that Katzenberg had given PDI \"rich financial incentives to induce them to whatever it would take to have Antz ready first, despite Pixar's head start\". [22] [25] Jobs was furious and called Katzenberg and began yelling. Katzenberg made an offer: He would delay production of Antz if Jobs and Disney would move A Bug's Life so that it did not compete with The Prince of Egypt . Jobs believed it \"a blatant extortion attempt \" and would not go for it, explaining that there was nothing he could do to convince Disney to change the date. [8] [25] Katzenberg casually responded that Jobs himself had taught him how to conduct similar business long ago, explaining that Jobs had come to Pixar's rescue by making the deal for Toy Story , as Pixar was near bankruptcy at that time. [15] \"I was the one guy there for you back then, and now you're allowing them to use you to screw me,\" Katzenberg said. [25] He suggested that if Jobs wanted to, he could simply slow down production on A Bug's Life without telling Disney. If he did, Katzenberg said, he would put Antz on hold. [8] Lasseter also claimed Katzenberg had phoned him with the proposition, but Katzenberg denied these charges later. [17]\nAs the release dates for both films approached, Disney executives concluded that Pixar should keep silent on the DreamWorks battle. Regardless, Lasseter publicly dismissed Antz as a \"schlock version\" of A Bug's Life . [19] Lasseter, who claimed to have never seen Antz , told others that if DreamWorks and PDI had made the film about anything other than insects, he would have closed Pixar for the day so the entire company could go see it. [8] [23] Jobs and Katzenberg would not back down and the rivaling ant films provoked a press frenzy. \"The bad guys rarely win,\" Jobs told the Los Angeles Times . In response, DreamWorks' head of marketing Terry Press suggested, \"Steve Jobs should take a pill.\" [25] Despite the successful box office performance of both Antz and A Bug's Life , tensions would remain high between Jobs and Katzenberg for many years. According to Jobs, Katzenberg came to Jobs after the success of Shrek (2001) and insisted he had never heard the pitch for A Bug's Life , reasoning that his settlement with Disney would have given him a share of the profits if that were so. [27] Although the contention left all parties estranged, Pixar and PDI employees kept up the old friendships that had arisen from spending a long time together in computer animation. [17]\nThe film's score was composed and conducted by Randy Newman . Walt Disney Records released the soundtrack on October 27, 1998. [28] The album's first track is a song called \"The Time of Your Life\" written and performed by Newman, while all the other 19 tracks are orchestral cues. Although the album was out of print physically in the United States during the 2000s, in June 2018 Universal Music Japan announced that a re-mastered edition would be released on October 3, 2018, along with other soundtrack albums from the Walt Disney Records pre-2018 catalogue. The album is also available for purchase on iTunes . The time duration is 47 minutes and 32 seconds. [29] Out of five stars, AllMusic , [28] Empire Online , [30] and Film Tracks rated the album three stars. [31] Movie Wave rated it four and a half. [32] The score won the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition . [29]\nA few weeks into the film's theatrical release, new outtakes were added to the theatrical prints. [33] Because the film is animated, no actual outtakes exist; they are animated specifically for the outtakes sequence.\nThe film\u2019s world premiere was on November 14, 1998, at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles . [ citation needed ]\nA few days before world premiere, the film was screened at Camp David . [34] [35] A day after the screening, the crew visited Oval Office in the White House . [34] [36]\nA Bug's Life was the first home video release to be entirely created using a digital transfer. Every frame of animation was converted from the film's computer data, as opposed to the standard analog film-to-videotape transfer process. This allowed for the film's DVD release to retain its original 2.35:1 widescreen format. [37] [38] The DVD was released on April 20, 1999, alongside a VHS release which was presented in a standard 1.33:1 \" fullscreen \" format. The film's fullscreen transfer was performed by entirely \"reframing\" the film shot by shot; more than half of the film's footage was modified by Pixar animators to fit within the film's aspect ratio. Several characters and objects were moved closer together to avoid being cut out of frame. [37] The film's VHS release was the best-selling VHS in the United Kingdom, with 1.76 million units sold by the end of the year. [39] On August 1, 2000, these editions were re-released on VHS and DVD under the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection banner. [40]\nOn November 23, 1999, a 2-disc Collector's Edition DVD was released. It was fully remastered in anamorphic widescreen and has substantial bonus features. [41] The edition was re-released on May 27, 2003, to coincide with the release of Finding Nemo . This THX -certified DVD released once again gives the option of viewing the film in Widescreen or Full Frame. [42] The second disc features numerous bonus features, such as a set-top game and a Finding Nemo featurette. [43]\nOn May 19, 2009, the film was released on Blu-ray [44] and then on 4K Blu-ray on March 3, 2020. [45]\nA Bug's Life grossed approximately $33.3 million on its opening weekend, [46] ranking first at the box office, beating out Babe: Pig in the City , The Rugrats Movie , Enemy of the State and The Waterboy . [47] [48] It managed to retain its spot for two weeks until it was taken by Star Trek: Insurrection . [49] [50] [51] The film had also earned $46.5 million during the five-day Thanksgiving holiday weekend, [52] surpassing the previous record holder 101 Dalmatians . [53] In 1999, this record was surpassed by Toy Story 2 , which would have the third biggest five-day Wednesday opening, just after Independence Day and Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace . [54]\nBy late December 1998, A Bug's Life had earned over $100 million. Altogether, several in-year 1998 films combined with Titanic pulled $7 billion in North America, propelling the film industry to a record year at the box office. [55] At the end of its theatrical run, the film grossed $162.8 million in the United States and Canada and $200.4 million in foreign countries, pushing its worldwide gross to $363.3 million, surpassing the competition from DreamWorks Animation 's Antz , [1] which earned $171.8 million worldwide. [56]\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , the film has a rating of 92% based on 88 reviews and an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \" A Bug's Life is a rousing adventure that blends animated thrills with witty dialogue and memorable characters \u2013 and another smashing early success for Pixar.\" [57] Another review aggregator, Metacritic , gave the film a score of 77 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". [58]\nTodd McCarthy of Variety wrote, \"Lasseter and Pixar broke new technical and aesthetic ground in the animation field with Toy Story , and here they surpass it in both scope and complexity of movement while telling a story that overlaps Antz in numerous ways.\" [59] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \" A Bug's Life , like Toy Story , develops protagonists we can root for, and places them in the midst of a fast-moving, energetic adventure.\" [60] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, writing \"Will A Bug's Life suffer by coming out so soon after Antz ? Not any more than one thriller hurts the chances for the next one. Antz may even help business for A Bug's Life by demonstrating how many dramatic and comedic possibilities can be found in an anthill.\" [61] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film four out of five stars, writing \"What A Bug's Life demonstrates is that when it comes to bugs, the most fun ones to hang out with hang exclusively with the gang at Pixar.\" [62] Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film four out of four stars, stating \" A Bug's Life is one of the great movies \u2013 a triumph of storytelling and character development, and a whole new ballgame for computer animation. Pixar Animation Studios has raised the genre to an astonishing new level\". [63]\nRichard Corliss of Time magazine wrote, \"The plot matures handsomely; the characters neatly converge and combust; the gags pay off with emotional resonance.\" [64] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B, saying \" A Bug's Life may be the single most amazing film I've ever seen that I couldn't fall in love with.\" [65] Paul Clinton of CNN wrote, \" A Bug's Life is a perfect movie for the holidays. It contains a great upbeat message ... it's wonderful to look at ... it's wildly inventive ... and it's entertaining for both adults and kids.\" [66] Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three and a half stars out of four, and compared the movie to \" Akira Kurosawa 's Seven Samurai (with a little of another art-film legend, Federico Fellini , tossed in).\" where \"As in Samurai , the colony here is plagued every year by the arrival of bandits.\" [67] On the contrary, Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post wrote, \"Clever as it is, the film lacks charm. One problem: too many bugs. Second, bigger world for two purposes: to feed birds and to irk humans.\" [68]\nA Bug's Life won a number of awards and numerous nominations. The film won the inaugural Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Animated Film (tied with The Prince of Egypt ) as well as the award for Best Family Film. It also won the Satellite Award for Best Animated Film and the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition by Randy Newman. It was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score , the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and the BAFTA Award for Best Achievement in Special Visual Effects. [69] In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Animation Films list . [70]\nIn the years since its release, A Bug's Life has been regarded by critics and fans to be a Pixar film that, in contrast to its successors, has become largely forgotten by audiences. [71] [72] [73] While recognised as solidifying Pixar's success, the film has been seen as the studio's sophomore slump in the wake of the critically successful Toy Story , [71] [72] [74] [75] [76] and inhibited by being released directly before the equally revered Toy Story 2 . [71] Pixar's feud with DreamWorks as a result of Antz has also been regarded as a factor in A Bug's Life ' s legacy. [76] [77]\nCritics have generally ranked A Bug's Life to be one of Pixar's weaker releases; [72] [75] [76] [78] [79] while it has been seen as a \"charming\" [73] [79] and \"ambitious\" [80] film with pioneering animation for its time, [71] [72] [80] others have described it as \"adequate\" [78] and appealing more to a younger demographic. [79] However, the film's characters, voice acting, and humor have received lasting praise. [72] [73] [74] [75] [80]\nThe film's theatrical and video releases include Geri's Game , an Academy Award winning Pixar short made in 1997, a year before this film was released. [81]\nA game, based on the film, was developed by Traveller's Tales and Tiertex Design Studios and released by Sony Computer Entertainment , Disney Interactive , THQ and Activision for various systems. The game's storyline was similar to the film's, with a few changes. However, unlike the film, the game received mixed reviews. [82] Aggregating review website GameRankings gave the Nintendo 64 version 54.40%, [83] the PlayStation version 51.90% [84] and the Game Boy Color version 36.63%. [85] GameSpot gave the PlayStation version a 2.7/10, concluding that it was \"obvious that Disney was more interested in producing a $40 advertisement for its movie than in developing a playable game.\" [86] IGN gave the Nintendo 64 version a 6.8/10, praising the presentation and sound by stating \"It was upbeat, cheery look and feel very much like the movie of the same name with cheery, happy tunes and strong sound effects but again criticised the gameplay by saying the controls were sluggish with stuttering framerate and tired gameplay mechanics\". [87] while they gave the PlayStation version a 4/10, criticizing the gameplay as slow and awkward but praising the presentation as cinematic. [88]\nDisney's Animal Kingdom includes the 3D show It's Tough to Be a Bug! , which also existed at Disney California Adventure from 2001 to 2018.

A Bug's Life Directed by John Lasseter Screenplay by Story by Produced by Starring Cinematography Sharon Calahan Edited by Lee Unkrich Music by Randy Newman Production companies Distributed by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution Release dates Running time 95 minutes [2] Country United States Language English Budget $120 million [1] Box office $363.3 million [1] A Bug's Life is a 1998 American computer-animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures . It was the second feature-length film produced by Pixar. Directed by John Lasseter and co-directed by Andrew Stanton , the film involves a misfit ant, Flik, who is looking for \"tough warriors\" to save his colony from a protection racket run by a gang of grasshoppers. Unfortunately, the \"warriors\" he brings back turn out to be an inept troupe of Circus Bugs. The film was initially inspired by Aesop 's fable The Ant and the Grasshopper . [3] [4] Production began shortly after the release of Toy Story in 1995. The screenplay was penned by Stanton and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, and Joe Ranft . The ants in the film were redesigned to be more appealing, and Pixar's animation unit employed technical innovations in computer animation. Randy Newman composed the music for the film. During production, a controversial public feud erupted between Steve Jobs and Lasseter of Pixar and DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg due to the parallel production of his similar film Antz , which was released the same year. The film was released on November 20, 1998, received positive reviews and grossed $363 million at the box office. It was the first film to be digitally transferred frame-by-frame and released on DVD , and has been released multiple times on home video. A colony of ants, led by the elderly Queen and her daughter Princess Atta, lives in the middle of a seasonally dry creekbed on a small hill known as \"Ant Island\". Every summer, they are forced to give food to a gang of bullying grasshoppers, led by Hopper. One day, a courageous but clumsy inventor ant named Flik inadvertently destroys the food offering with his grain harvester. Hopper discovers this, and demands twice as much food as compensation. When Flik earnestly suggests the ants enlist the help of bigger bugs to fight the grasshoppers, Atta sees it as a way to get rid of Flik and sends him off. Flik travels to \"the city\", a heap of trash under a trailer. Happening upon the aftermath of a chaotic bar fight, Flik mistakes a troupe of jobless Circus Bugs for the warrior bugs he seeks. The bugs, in turn, mistake Flik for a talent agent, and agree to travel with him back to Ant Island. During a welcome ceremony upon their arrival, the Circus Bugs and Flik discover their mutual misunderstandings. The Circus Bugs attempt to leave, but are pursued by a nearby bird; while fleeing, they rescue Atta's younger sister Dot from the bird, gaining the ants' respect. At Flik's request, the Circus Bugs continue the ruse of being \"warriors\", thus enabling them to continue enjoying the ants' hospitality. Learning that Hopper fears birds inspires Flik to build a crewed ornithopter disguised as a bird to scare away the grasshoppers. Meanwhile, Hopper reminds his gang of the ants' superior numbers, warning them the ants will rebel if not kept in line. The ants finish constructing the fake bird. During the subsequent celebration, the Circus Bugs' old boss, P.T. Flea, arrives, seeking to rehire them and blowing their cover. The ants, angered to learn that Flik lied to them, exile him and the Circus Bugs, and desperately attempt to gather food for a new offering. Hopper returns and sees the mediocre offering; he takes over the island, and demands the ants' own winter food supply, planning to execute the Queen afterward. Overhearing the plan, Dot persuades Flik and the Circus Bugs to return to Ant Island. After the Circus Bugs distract the grasshoppers long enough to rescue the Queen, Flik deploys the bird. It initially fools the grasshoppers, but P.T., who is also fooled, sets the bird on fire. Realizing the deception, Hopper has Flik publicly beaten to teach the ants a lesson, proclaiming that the ants are lowly life forms who live solely to serve the grasshoppers. Flik asserts that Hopper actually fears the colony, because he has always known what they are capable of. This inspires the ants and the Circus Bugs to fight back against the grasshoppers, driving all but Hopper away. The ants shove Hopper into the circus cannon to shoot him off of the island, but rain suddenly begins to fall. In the ensuing chaos, Hopper frees himself from the cannon and abducts Flik. The Circus Bugs and Atta pursue, with the latter catching up to Hopper and rescuing Flik. Flik lures Hopper to the real bird's nest; believing the bird is another fake, Hopper taunts it, until it grabs him and feeds him to its chicks. With the anthill now at peace, Flik improves his inventions to help gather food for the ants. He and Atta become a couple, and send Hopper's affable brother Molt and a few ants to help P.T. and the Circus Bugs on their new tour. Atta and Dot become the new Queen and Princess, respectively.

[6] The storyline for A Bug's Life originated from a lunchtime conversation between John Lasseter , Andrew Stanton , Pete Docter , and Joe Ranft , the studio's head story team; other films such as Monsters, Inc. , Finding Nemo and WALL-E were also conceived at this lunch. [7] Lasseter and his story team had already been drawn to the idea of insects serving as characters. Like toys, insects were within the reach of computer animation back then, due to their relatively simple surfaces. Stanton and Ranft wondered whether they could find a starting point in Aesop's fable The Ant and the Grasshopper . [7] Walt Disney had produced his own version with a cheerier ending decades earlier in the 1934 short film The Grasshopper and the Ants . In addition, Walt Disney Feature Animation had considered producing a film in the late-1980s entitled Army Ants , that centered around a pacifist ant living in a militaristic colony, but this never fully materialized. [8] As Stanton and Ranft discussed the adaptation, they rattled off scenarios and storylines springing from their premise. [7] Lasseter liked the idea and offered some suggestions. The concept simmered until early 1995, when the story team began work on the second film in earnest. [7] During an early test screening for Toy Story in San Rafael in June 1995, they pitched the film to Disney CEO Michael Eisner . Eisner thought the idea was fine and they submitted a treatment to Disney in early July under the title Bugs . [7] Disney approved the treatment and gave notice on July 7 that it was exercising the option of a second film under the original 1991 agreement between Disney and Pixar. [9] Lasseter assigned the co-director job to Stanton; both worked well together and had similar sensibilities. Lasseter had realized that working on a computer-animated feature as a sole director was dangerous while the production of Toy Story was in process. [9] In addition, Lasseter believed that it would relieve stress and that the role would groom Stanton for having his own position as a lead director. [10] In The Ant and the Grasshopper , a grasshopper squanders the spring and summer months on singing while the ants put food away for the winter; when winter comes, the hungry grasshopper begs the ants for food, but the ants turn him away. [7] Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft hit on the notion that the grasshopper could just take the food. [7] [11] After Stanton had completed a draft of the script, he came to doubt one of the story's main pillars \u2013 that the Circus Bugs that had come to the colony to cheat the ants would instead stay and fight. [10] He thought the Circus Bugs were unlikable characters as liars and that it was unrealistic for them to undergo a complete personality change. Also, no particularly good reason existed for Circus Bugs to stay with the ant colony during the second act. [12] Although the film was already far along, Stanton concluded that the story needed a different approach. [10] Stanton took one of the early circus bug characters, Red the red ant , and changed him into the character Flik. [12] The Circus Bugs, no longer out to cheat the colony, would be embroiled in a comic misunderstanding as to why Flik was recruiting them. Lasseter agreed with this new approach, and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw spent a few months working on further polishing with Stanton. [13] The characters \"Tuck and Roll\" were inspired by a drawing that Stanton did of two bugs fighting when he was in the second grade. [11] Lasseter had come to envision the film as an epic in the tradition of David Lean 's 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia . [12] [14] The voice cast was heavy with television sitcom stars of the time: Flik was voiced by Dave Foley (from NewsRadio ), Princess Atta was voiced by Julia Louis-Dreyfus (from Seinfeld ), Molt was voiced by Richard Kind (from Spin City ), Slim was voiced by David Hyde Pierce (from Frasier ) and Dim was voiced by Brad Garrett (from Everybody Loves Raymond ). Joe Ranft , member of Pixar's story team, played Heimlich the caterpillar at the suggestion of Lasseter's wife, Nancy, who had heard him playing the character on a scratch vocal track. [15] The casting of Hopper, the film's villain, proved problematic. Lasseter's top choice was Robert De Niro , who repeatedly turned the part down, as did a succession of other actors. [15] Kevin Spacey met John Lasseter at the 1995 Academy Awards and Lasseter asked Spacey if he would be interested in doing the voice of Hopper. Spacey was delighted and signed on immediately. [12] A Bug's Life was the final film appearance of actor Roddy McDowall , who played Mr. Soil, dying shortly before the film's theatrical release. [16] It was more difficult for animators during the production of A Bug's Life than that of Toy Story , as computers ran sluggishly due to the complexity of the character models. Lasseter and Stanton had two supervising animators to assist with directing and reviewing the animation: Rich Quade and Glenn McQueen . [3] The first sequence to be animated and rendered was the circus sequence that culminated with P.T. Flea's \"Flaming Wall of Death\". Lasseter placed this scene first in the pipeline because he believed it was \"less likely to change\". [17] Lasseter thought it would be useful to look at a view of the world from an insect's perspective. Two technicians obliged by creating a miniature video camera on Lego wheels, which they dubbed as the \"Bugcam\". [10] [18] Fastened to the end of a stick, the Bugcam could roll through grass and other terrain and send back an insect's-eye outlook. Lasseter was intrigued by the way grass, leaves, and flower petals formed a translucent canopy, as if the insects were living under a stained-glass ceiling. The team also later sought inspiration from Microcosmos (1996), a French documentary on love and violence in the insect world. [10] The transition from treatment to storyboards took on an extra layer of complexity due to the profusion of storylines. Where Toy Story focused heavily on Woody and Buzz, with the other toys serving mostly as sidekicks, A Bug's Life required in-depth storytelling for several major groups of characters. [13] Character design also presented a new challenge, in that the designers had to make ants appear likable. Although the animators and the art department studied insects more closely, natural realism would give way to the film's larger needs. [14] The team took out mandibles and designed the ants to stand upright, replacing their normal six legs with two arms and two legs. The grasshoppers, in contrast, received a pair of extra appendages to appear less attractive. [14] The story's scale also required software engineers to accommodate new demands. Among these was the need to handle shots with crowds of ants. [14] The film would include more than 400 such shots in the ant colony, some with as many as 800. It was impractical for animators to control them individually, but neither could the ants remain static for even a moment without appearing lifeless, or move identically. Bill Reeves, one of the film's two supervising technical directors, dealt with the quandary by leading the development of software for autonomous ants. [14] The animators would only animate four or five groups of about eight individual \"universal ants\". Each one of these \"universal ants\" would later be randomly distributed throughout the digital set. The program also allowed each ant to be automatically modified in subtle ways (e.g. different color of eye or skin, different heights, different weights, etc.). This ensured that no two ants were the same. [18] It was partly based on Reeves's invention of particle systems a decade and a half earlier, which had let animators use masses of self-guided particles to create effects like swirling dust and snow. [15] The animators also employed subsurface scattering \u2014developed by Pixar co-founder Edwin Catmull during his graduate student days at the University of Utah in the 1970s\u2014to render surfaces in a more lifelike way. This would be the first time that subsurface scattering would be used in a Pixar film, and a small team at Pixar worked out the practical problems that kept it from working in animation. Catmull asked for a short film to test and showcase subsurface scattering and the result, Geri's Game (1997), was attached alongside A Bug's Life in its theatrical release. [19] During the production of A Bug's Life , a public feud erupted between DreamWorks ' Jeffrey Katzenberg , and Pixar's Steve Jobs and John Lasseter. Katzenberg, former chairman of Disney's film division, had left the company in a bitter feud with CEO Michael Eisner. In response, he formed DreamWorks SKG with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen and planned to rival Disney in animation. [20] After DreamWorks' acquisition of Pacific Data Images (PDI)\u2014long Pixar's contemporary in computer animation\u2014Lasseter and others at Pixar were dismayed to learn from the trade papers that PDI's first project at DreamWorks would be another ant film, to be called Antz . [21] By this time, Pixar's project was well known within the animation community. [22] Both Antz and A Bug's Life center on a young male ant, a drone with oddball tendencies that struggles to win a princess's hand by saving their society. Whereas A Bug's Life relied chiefly on visual gags, Antz was more verbal and revolved more around satire. The script of Antz was also heavy with adult references, whereas Pixar's film was more accessible to children. [23] It was clear that Lasseter and Jobs believed that the idea was stolen by Katzenberg. [8] [20] Katzenberg had stayed in touch with Lasseter after the acrimonious Disney split, often calling to check up. In October 1995, when Lasseter was overseeing postproduction work on Toy Story at the Universal lot's Technicolor facility in Universal City , where DreamWorks was also located, he called Katzenberg and dropped by with Stanton. [20] [24] When Katzenberg asked what they were doing next, Lasseter described what would become A Bug's Life in detail. Lasseter respected Katzenberg's judgment and felt comfortable using him as a sounding board for creative ideas. [24] Lasseter had high hopes for Toy Story , and he was telling friends throughout the tight-knit computer-animation business to get cracking on their own films. \"If this hits, it's going to be like space movies after Star Wars \" for computer animation companies, he told various friends. [8] \"I should have been wary,\" Lasseter later recalled. \"Jeffrey kept asking questions about when it would be released.\" [20] When the trades indicated production on Antz , Lasseter, feeling betrayed, called Katzenberg and asked him bluntly if it were true, who in turn asked him where he had heard the rumor. Lasseter asked again, and Katzenberg admitted it was true. Lasseter raised his voice and would not believe Katzenberg's story that a development director had pitched him the idea long ago. Katzenberg claimed Antz came from a 1991 story pitch by Tim Johnson that was related to Katzenberg in October 1994. [8] Another source gives Nina Jacobson , one of Katzenberg's executives, as the person responsible for the Antz pitch. [22] Lasseter, who normally did not use profane language, cursed at Katzenberg and hung up the phone. [25] Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg began explaining that Disney was \"out to get him\" and that he realized that he was just cannon fodder in Katzenberg's fight with Disney. [8] [22] For his part, Katzenberg believed he was the victim of a conspiracy: Eisner had decided not to pay him his contract-required bonus, convincing Disney's board not to give him anything. [22] Katzenberg was further angered by the fact that Eisner scheduled Bugs to open the same week as The Prince of Egypt , which was then intended to be DreamWorks' first animated release. [22] [25] Lasseter grimly relayed the news to Pixar employees but kept morale high. Privately, Lasseter told other Pixar executives that he and Stanton felt terribly let down by Katzenberg. [22] Katzenberg moved the opening of Antz from spring 1999 to October 1998 to compete with Pixar's release. [22] [26] David Price writes in his 2008 book The Pixar Touch that a rumor, \"never confirmed\", was that Katzenberg had given PDI \"rich financial incentives to induce them to whatever it would take to have Antz ready first, despite Pixar's head start\". [22] [25] Jobs was furious and called Katzenberg and began yelling. Katzenberg made an offer: He would delay production of Antz if Jobs and Disney would move A Bug's Life so that it did not compete with The Prince of Egypt . Jobs believed it \"a blatant extortion attempt \" and would not go for it, explaining that there was nothing he could do to convince Disney to change the date. [8] [25] Katzenberg casually responded that Jobs himself had taught him how to conduct similar business long ago, explaining that Jobs had come to Pixar's rescue by making the deal for Toy Story , as Pixar was near bankruptcy at that time. [15] \"I was the one guy there for you back then, and now you're allowing them to use you to screw me,\" Katzenberg said. [25] He suggested that if Jobs wanted to, he could simply slow down production on A Bug's Life without telling Disney. If he did, Katzenberg said, he would put Antz on hold. [8] Lasseter also claimed Katzenberg had phoned him with the proposition, but Katzenberg denied these charges later. [17] As the release dates for both films approached, Disney executives concluded that Pixar should keep silent on the DreamWorks battle. Regardless, Lasseter publicly dismissed Antz as a \"schlock version\" of A Bug's Life . [19] Lasseter, who claimed to have never seen Antz , told others that if DreamWorks and PDI had made the film about anything other than insects, he would have closed Pixar for the day so the entire company could go see it. [8] [23] Jobs and Katzenberg would not back down and the rivaling ant films provoked a press frenzy. \"The bad guys rarely win,\" Jobs told the Los Angeles Times . In response, DreamWorks' head of marketing Terry Press suggested, \"Steve Jobs should take a pill.\" [25] Despite the successful box office performance of both Antz and A Bug's Life , tensions would remain high between Jobs and Katzenberg for many years. According to Jobs, Katzenberg came to Jobs after the success of Shrek (2001) and insisted he had never heard the pitch for A Bug's Life , reasoning that his settlement with Disney would have given him a share of the profits if that were so. [27] Although the contention left all parties estranged, Pixar and PDI employees kept up the old friendships that had arisen from spending a long time together in computer animation. [17] The film's score was composed and conducted by Randy Newman . Walt Disney Records released the soundtrack on October 27, 1998. [28] The album's first track is a song called \"The Time of Your Life\" written and performed by Newman, while all the other 19 tracks are orchestral cues. Although the album was out of print physically in the United States during the 2000s, in June 2018 Universal Music Japan announced that a re-mastered edition would be released on October 3, 2018, along with other soundtrack albums from the Walt Disney Records pre-2018 catalogue. The album is also available for purchase on iTunes . The time duration is 47 minutes and 32 seconds. [29] Out of five stars, AllMusic , [28] Empire Online , [30] and Film Tracks rated the album three stars. [31] Movie Wave rated it four and a half. [32] The score won the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition . [29] A few weeks into the film's theatrical release, new outtakes were added to the theatrical prints. [33] Because the film is animated, no actual outtakes exist; they are animated specifically for the outtakes sequence. The film\u2019s world premiere was on November 14, 1998, at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles . [ citation needed ] A few days before world premiere, the film was screened at Camp David . [34] [35] A day after the screening, the crew visited Oval Office in the White House . [34] [36] A Bug's Life was the first home video release to be entirely created using a digital transfer. Every frame of animation was converted from the film's computer data, as opposed to the standard analog film-to-videotape transfer process. This allowed for the film's DVD release to retain its original 2.35:1 widescreen format. [37] [38] The DVD was released on April 20, 1999, alongside a VHS release which was presented in a standard 1.33:1 \" fullscreen \" format. The film's fullscreen transfer was performed by entirely \"reframing\" the film shot by shot; more than half of the film's footage was modified by Pixar animators to fit within the film's aspect ratio. Several characters and objects were moved closer together to avoid being cut out of frame. [37] The film's VHS release was the best-selling VHS in the United Kingdom, with 1.76 million units sold by the end of the year. [39] On August 1, 2000, these editions were re-released on VHS and DVD under the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection banner. [40] On November 23, 1999, a 2-disc Collector's Edition DVD was released. It was fully remastered in anamorphic widescreen and has substantial bonus features. [41] The edition was re-released on May 27, 2003, to coincide with the release of Finding Nemo . This THX -certified DVD released once again gives the option of viewing the film in Widescreen or Full Frame. [42] The second disc features numerous bonus features, such as a set-top game and a Finding Nemo featurette. [43] On May 19, 2009, the film was released on Blu-ray [44] and then on 4K Blu-ray on March 3, 2020. [45] A Bug's Life grossed approximately $33.3 million on its opening weekend, [46] ranking first at the box office, beating out Babe: Pig in the City , The Rugrats Movie , Enemy of the State and The Waterboy . [47] [48] It managed to retain its spot for two weeks until it was taken by Star Trek: Insurrection . [49] [50] [51] The film had also earned $46.5 million during the five-day Thanksgiving holiday weekend, [52] surpassing the previous record holder 101 Dalmatians . [53] In 1999, this record was surpassed by Toy Story 2 , which would have the third biggest five-day Wednesday opening, just after Independence Day and Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace . [54] By late December 1998, A Bug's Life had earned over $100 million. Altogether, several in-year 1998 films combined with Titanic pulled $7 billion in North America, propelling the film industry to a record year at the box office. [55] At the end of its theatrical run, the film grossed $162.8 million in the United States and Canada and $200.4 million in foreign countries, pushing its worldwide gross to $363.3 million, surpassing the competition from DreamWorks Animation 's Antz , [1] which earned $171.8 million worldwide. [56] On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , the film has a rating of 92% based on 88 reviews and an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \" A Bug's Life is a rousing adventure that blends animated thrills with witty dialogue and memorable characters \u2013 and another smashing early success for Pixar.\" [57] Another review aggregator, Metacritic , gave the film a score of 77 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". [58] Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote, \"Lasseter and Pixar broke new technical and aesthetic ground in the animation field with Toy Story , and here they surpass it in both scope and complexity of movement while telling a story that overlaps Antz in numerous ways.\" [59] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \" A Bug's Life , like Toy Story , develops protagonists we can root for, and places them in the midst of a fast-moving, energetic adventure.\" [60] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, writing \"Will A Bug's Life suffer by coming out so soon after Antz ? Not any more than one thriller hurts the chances for the next one. Antz may even help business for A Bug's Life by demonstrating how many dramatic and comedic possibilities can be found in an anthill.\" [61] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film four out of five stars, writing \"What A Bug's Life demonstrates is that when it comes to bugs, the most fun ones to hang out with hang exclusively with the gang at Pixar.\" [62] Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film four out of four stars, stating \" A Bug's Life is one of the great movies \u2013 a triumph of storytelling and character development, and a whole new ballgame for computer animation. Pixar Animation Studios has raised the genre to an astonishing new level\". [63] Richard Corliss of Time magazine wrote, \"The plot matures handsomely; the characters neatly converge and combust; the gags pay off with emotional resonance.\" [64] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B, saying \" A Bug's Life may be the single most amazing film I've ever seen that I couldn't fall in love with.\" [65] Paul Clinton of CNN wrote, \" A Bug's Life is a perfect movie for the holidays. It contains a great upbeat message ... it's wonderful to look at ... it's wildly inventive ... and it's entertaining for both adults and kids.\" [66] Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three and a half stars out of four, and compared the movie to \" Akira Kurosawa 's Seven Samurai (with a little of another art-film legend, Federico Fellini , tossed in).\" where \"As in Samurai , the colony here is plagued every year by the arrival of bandits.\" [67] On the contrary, Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post wrote, \"Clever as it is, the film lacks charm. One problem: too many bugs. Second, bigger world for two purposes: to feed birds and to irk humans.\" [68] A Bug's Life won a number of awards and numerous nominations. The film won the inaugural Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Animated Film (tied with The Prince of Egypt ) as well as the award for Best Family Film. It also won the Satellite Award for Best Animated Film and the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition by Randy Newman. It was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score , the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and the BAFTA Award for Best Achievement in Special Visual Effects. [69] In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Animation Films list . [70] In the years since its release, A Bug's Life has been regarded by critics and fans to be a Pixar film that, in contrast to its successors, has become largely forgotten by audiences. [71] [72] [73] While recognised as solidifying Pixar's success, the film has been seen as the studio's sophomore slump in the wake of the critically successful Toy Story , [71] [72] [74] [75] [76] and inhibited by being released directly before the equally revered Toy Story 2 . [71] Pixar's feud with DreamWorks as a result of Antz has also been regarded as a factor in A Bug's Life ' s legacy. [76] [77] Critics have generally ranked A Bug's Life to be one of Pixar's weaker releases; [72] [75] [76] [78] [79] while it has been seen as a \"charming\" [73] [79] and \"ambitious\" [80] film with pioneering animation for its time, [71] [72] [80] others have described it as \"adequate\" [78] and appealing more to a younger demographic. [79] However, the film's characters, voice acting, and humor have received lasting praise. [72] [73] [74] [75] [80] The film's theatrical and video releases include Geri's Game , an Academy Award winning Pixar short made in 1997, a year before this film was released. [81] A game, based on the film, was developed by Traveller's Tales and Tiertex Design Studios and released by Sony Computer Entertainment , Disney Interactive , THQ and Activision for various systems. The game's storyline was similar to the film's, with a few changes. However, unlike the film, the game received mixed reviews. [82] Aggregating review website GameRankings gave the Nintendo 64 version 54.40%, [83] the PlayStation version 51.90% [84] and the Game Boy Color version 36.63%. [85] GameSpot gave the PlayStation version a 2.7/10, concluding that it was \"obvious that Disney was more interested in producing a $40 advertisement for its movie than in developing a playable game.\" [86] IGN gave the Nintendo 64 version a 6.8/10, praising the presentation and sound by stating \"It was upbeat, cheery look and feel very much like the movie of the same name with cheery, happy tunes and strong sound effects but again criticised the gameplay by saying the controls were sluggish with stuttering framerate and tired gameplay mechanics\". [87] while they gave the PlayStation version a 4/10, criticizing the gameplay as slow and awkward but praising the presentation as cinematic. [88] Disney's Animal Kingdom includes the 3D show It's Tough to Be a Bug! , which also existed at Disney California Adventure from 2001 to 2018. The Disney California Adventure nighttime show World of Color features a segment that includes Heimlich the Caterpillar from the film. [89] From 2002 to 2018, A Bug's Land was a section of Disney California Adventure that was inspired by the film.", "documentFile": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bug%27s_Life"}, {"source_title": "A

The 10-part 2013 television series The White Queen adapted Gregory's previous novels The White Queen (2009), The Red Queen (2010) and The Kingmaker's Daughter (2012). [13] The series was broadcast on BBC One in the United Kingdom and on Starz in the United States, and features Freya Mavor as a young Elizabeth of York. [13] Despite initial plans for a second series, on 20 August 2013 the BBC announced they were not commissioning one, possibly because of the lukewarm reception the series received. [14] However, in October 2013, The Telegraph reported that Starz was planning to develop a sequel miniseries called The White Princess , based on Gregory's novel. [15] Starz CEO Chris Albrecht announced in January 2014 that the network was working with White Queen screenwriter Emma Frost on the project. [16] Starz would produce the White Princess miniseries without involvement from the BBC. [16] Gregory confirmed that the project was underway in August 2015. [17] On 7 February 2016, Gregory announced on Facebook that the sequel was officially confirmed to be in production, with the scripts being written. [18] The series was confirmed to be eight episodes in May 2016. [19] [20] Jamie Payne, who directed three episodes of The White Queen , directed episodes 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8. Frost was the showrunner and executive producer. Lachlan MacKinnon is served as producer, with Gregory as executive producer. Playground's Colin Callender and Scott Huff also executive produced with Company Pictures ' Michele Buck. [21] In early January 2017, the producers released a video clip from the series as a teaser trailer. [30] In February 2017, Starz announced that The White Princess would premiere on 16 April 2017. [31] In the UK the series began its satellite and terrestrial broadcasts on the Drama channel on 18 November 2017. The miniseries received generally favorable reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes , it has an approval rating of 76% based on reviews from 17 critics, with an average rating of 6.95/10. The website's critics consensus indicated the series was \"well-acted and enlivened by its fresh perspective\" and \"delivers more than enough intrigue to satisfy fans of period British royal court drama.\" [32] On Metacritic , the show has a weighted average score of 71 based on reviews from 9 critics. [33] On 15 March 2018, Starz announced that it will create a continuation of The White Queen and The White Princess to be titled The Spanish Princess , which will be based on Gregory's novels The Constant Princess and The King's Curse and center on Catherine of Aragon .

characters in several of the other Cousin's War novels. She was the oldest daughter and child of Richard and Jacquetta Woodville , the Queen Consort of Edward IV , and the mother of the Princes in the Tower and Elizabeth of York .\nElizabeth and her family were loyal to the House of Lancaster until her marriage to Edward IV, the heir of the House of York. Her previous loyalties and commoner status made her an unpopular consort, and she quickly gained enemies, especially in Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick , and George, Duke of Clarence .\nDespite her lack of popularity, Elizabeth still gave her all to the House of York: she was a faithful loving wife to her husband, an attentive devoted mother to all her children, and overall a strong, shrewd, and courageous Queen. She was also famed as the most beautiful Queen that England had ever seen, and was rumored by some - especially her enemies - to be a real witch with genuine supernatural powers. While she herself never verified these rumors to others, Elizabeth did possess magical powers due to her being a descendant of the Water Goddess Melusina , and she practiced these abilities in secret to aid herself and her family.\nIn the BBC television series adaptation of The White Queen , she is portrayed by Rebecca Ferguson.\nAfter being widowed and losing her lands, Elizabeth decides to appeal to the new York king, Edward IV, to help her. Edward agrees to assist her in getting her lands back, but the pair are also strongly attracted to each other upon sight and eventually fall in love. Even though Elizabeth is a widow, a commoner, and belongs to a family originally loyal to Lancaster, Edward decides to marry her. Feeling that he cannot live without her and vice versa. The pair marry in secret, with only a priest, choir boy, a lady-in-waiting and Elizabeth's mother in attendance.\nElizabeth's brother Anthony is convinced that Edward tricked Elizabeth into a fake marriage just so he could sleep with her. Elizabeth refuses to believe this and despite underlying doubts, she is certain that Edward will be faithful to her. This is later proved true, as Edward announces that he has married Elizabeth and has her brought to court, where she is crowned Queen of England. Although Elizabeth is happy in her new marriage, her sudden rise to greatness earns her many enemies, including Duchess Cecily, her new mother-in-law, and Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick , Edward's adviser. Some even whisper that she used witchcraft to make the king fall in love with her, though she pays little attention to these rumors. Elizabeth does her best to make her family powerful and wealthy, to protect them, and supports Edward in all that he does. She also bears him several daughters, the eldest of whom, named Elizabeth after her, she believes has the Sight.\nEventually, though, war breaks out again. Elizabeth is forced to flee into sanctuary at Westminster Abbey on a number of occasions, and actually gives birth to Edward's first son, Edward V, there. Elizabeth is devastated when she learns her father and brother John have been captured and beheaded on Warwick's orders, without trial. As a result, she places a curse on Warwick and George Duke of Clarence , whom she also holds responsible, praying to Melusina that they shall die and thus pay for the deaths of her family. Elizabeth also uses magic to 'make' a storm at sea to prevent Warwick's ships from escaping to Calais; this inadvertently results in his daughter, Isabel , suffering a miscarriage, for which Elizabeth feels guilty. Elizabeth bears Edward yet more children and encourages him to execute George after he is found to have plotting against his brother - George also accused Elizabeth of murdering his wife Isabel, and executed a servant woman whom Elizabeth had placed in George's household as a spy. However, she was innocent of playing any part in Isabel's death.\nAfter Edward dies, Elizabeth's brother-in-law Richard Duke of Gloucester seizes the throne; he declares that Elizabeth's marriage to Edward was not legal - therefore, their sons are bastards and cannot inherit the throne, and Elizabeth is stripped of her title. Elizabeth goes into sanctuary and plots to protect her children and reclaim their inheritance. She is forced to send her sons with Edward, Edward and Richard, as hostages. Not trusting Richard, Elizabeth secretly sends a pageboy disguised as Richard in his place and sends the real Richard to a safehouse overseas. The boys later disappear and Elizabeth fears that Edward has been killed. She allies herself with Margaret Beaufort to fight King Richard, believing that he is responsible for her son's death; she also puts a curse on Richard that causes his sword arm to weaken. When Elizabeth learns from Richard that he didn't kill her son, she is unsure of what to believe. She and her daughter Elizabeth place a curse on whomever is responsible, that they and their first-born son and grandson should all die, leaving only girls to inherit (as it is implied that Margaret and her son Henry Tudor are responsible for Edward V's murder, this foreshadows the events of the Tudor Court novels, in which Henry's firstborn Arthur dies young from illness, Henry VIII's first son dies in infancy and his only living son dies without children, leaving only his daughters, Mary and Elizabeth).\nThe novel ends with Elizabeth hoping that Henry Tudor will be killed at the Battle of Bosworth and that she can bring Richard safely home and reclaim the throne for him.\nJacquetta takes a special mixture of herbs in order to conceive Elizabeth, her first child, resulting in her marrying her lover Richard. Jacquetta is certain that Elizabeth has inherited her gift of Sight and other powers from their water goddess ancestor, Melusina. Jacquetta teaches Elizabeth all that she knows about magic. Elizabeth later falls in love with Sir John Grey and marries him, becoming lady of Groby Hall. Jacquetta, however, 'Sees' that their relationship will have no future, but does not tell Elizabeth this. Elizabeth gives birth to two sons, Richard and Thomas. Her husband fights for the House of Lancaster in the Cousin's War. Unfortunately, John is killed during the battle of St Albans. Elizabeth's mother-in-law refuses to give her her dowry lands, forcing a now penniless Elizabeth and her sons to move in with her parents and live off their charity. Jacquetta, however, predicts that Elizabeth has a great destiny ahead of her yet.\nIn the Kingmaker's Daughter, Elizabeth is a endless source of admiration, disdain and mistrust for the Neville Daughters. The novel opens in May 1465 as the Neville family arrive at the Tower of London to pay homage to the new queen consort Elizabeth Woodville . Edward\u2019s choice in bride is met with disapproval by Warwick and as a wife and two daughters; Anne and Isabel . When presented to the new queen, Young Anne is mesmerized by her beauty and her open adoration for the queen is a source of embarrassment for her mother and sister who dislike Elizabeth immensely. Warwick and Duchess Cecily are notably absent and in their absence Jacquetta Woodville presides over the proceedings. Later that evening as they prepare for bed, Anne praises Elizabeth\u2019s beauty while Isabel haughtily criticizes Elizabeth\u2019s conduct and says if that she were queen she would be \u201ca true Queen, a Queen of ice\u201d. The girls make a game of playing \u201cQueen of England\u201d until a fight breaks out between the two and they are put to bed to get rest for Elizabeth\u2019s coronation in the morning. By July, Anne and Isabel Neville are asked to join the Queen's household; an honor which Warwick turns down due to his enmity of Elizabeth.\nOver the next two years, Elizabeth encroaches on Warwick\u2019s influence over Edward and drives a wedge between the two cousins. Anne and Isabel are equally dismayed that the Woodville daughters are married to wealthy noblemen and this diminishes their own marriage prospects. Warwick intends for his daughters to marry the royal dukes, Richard and George, but Elizabeth is against the marriages for they would make the ambitious Warwick over mighty. This forces Warwick to marry Isabel to George without the king's permission and further the hostility between Edward and Warwick.\nAfter the wedding, Warwick decides to go to war against Edward to rid England of the Woodvilles. Warwick is swift in his revolt against Edward: executing Elizabeth\u2019s father and brother, placing her mother on trial for witchcraft and imprisoning Edward himself. Elizabeth goes into sanctuary while the Nevilles revel in their triumph over Elizabeth. Isabel alone is the only one that worries about there being multiple queen's in England. Her caution is warranted for Warwick restores Edward and so Elizabeth. The Nevilles are brought to court to show their loyalty to the restored queen Elizabeth. Anne and Isabel are apprehensive of approaching Elizabeth, who coldly regards them, and Jacquetta who is openly hostile swearing her enmity and blows a whistle that snuffs out a candle by Isabel\u2019s side. Despite their treason and imprisonment of the king, the Nevilles must play the part of loyal subjects and take great pains to involve themselves at court with Isabel and Anne being invited into the queen\u2019s household as ladies-in-waiting. While their appointment was a gracious gesture from Edward the girls are frightened by prospect of serving Elizabeth. Elizabeth\u2019s treatment of the girls is intolerable for she openly ignores them. However Anne never faults Elizabeth for this for she is ashamed and knows that her family acting in the wrong. Anne\u2019s unhappiness manifests into sickness and her mother informs her to stop complaining as they all are suffering because of Warwick\u2019s miscalculated gamble. Anne hopes that they all will be happier when they leave court for Isabel\u2019s confinement however upon arrival at Warwick castle they quickly discover that Warwick is planning to place George on the English throne. Warwick's plan fails and they must flee to Calais to spare their lives and regroup. The family make their way to Devon and are pleased to see that the weather is fair and the sea is calm which will aid their escape. However as they board the ship they see at Warwick\u2019s horse, midnight, is nervous and Isabel herself is increasingly fearful and refusing to board the ship until Warwick sternly forces her. By nightfall a storm (implied to have been sent by Elizabeth Woodville) is gathering as Isabel goes into labor. The storm intensifies as Isabel\u2019s labor becomes increasingly difficult and they are refused entry into Calais on the grounds that Calais has stayed loyal to York and not to Warwick. With no alternative and no means to fetch a doctor; Anne with her slender hands must reposition Isabel\u2019s baby and deliver it. Isabel gives birth but to a stillborn son.\nMiraculously the ship survives the storm and the family sail to Paris. Their mother removed the dead baby and they believe that it was tossed overboard. George is displeased with the news about the baby (particularly as Elizabeth is pregnant again) while Isabel firmly believes that her child would have lived had it not been for Elizabeth\u2019s curse.\nIt is at Elizabeth's behest that Princess Lizzie and all the remaining royal York children are brought to London after the decisive battle of Bosworth. Elizabeth urges Lizzie to forget about her relationship with Richard and to focus on her future as the new king's intended bride. She delights at being reunited with her children though coolly deflects Cecily's comments about Henry rejecting Lizzie and her relationship with Richard. When Cecily is dismissed, Elizabeth informs Lizzie that Lady Margaret all but rules the court and they must endure her until Lizzie is crowned Queen.\nThe Yorks wait for invitation or visit from King Henry yet he pointedly holds court without them. Henry's invasion of England brought a mysterious new disease, the Sweating Sickness, that ravages England and delays Henry's coronation. Lizzie questions her mother on whether or nor the sickness was wrought by her powers which amuses Elizabeth. During the moment of intimacy, Elizabeth confirms that Prince Richard is safe but will say no more.\nElizabeth was married to Sir John Grey, who died at the Second Battle of St Albans in 1461 fighting for the Lancastrian king, Henry VI. Elizabeth's father, Baron Rivers, also supported the House of Lancaster. Her mother Jacquetta was a relation to both Henry VI and his wife Margaret of Anjou.\nOne morning Elizabeth begged the new York king, Edward IV, for mercy and to have her late husband's land returned to her and her two sons. Edward \u2013 who had a reputation as a bit of a playboy \u2013 fell for her instantly.\nEdward wanted Elizabeth to be his mistress, but she refused. She even put a knife to her own neck to ward off his advances. Edward went to battle and Elizabeth missed him terribly. When he returned he asked her to marry her and she agreed.\nThey had a secret wedding, and Edward announced their marriage to a shocked court and a furious Warwick.\nWhen Warwick convinced George to fight for his brother's crown, the country was at war again. Elizabeth's father and brothers fought for the King and were executed by Warwick.\nElizabeth and her mother were heartbroken and vengeful. Jacquetta, who dabbled in witchcraft, helped Elizabeth curse Warwick and George.\nWarwick was killed in battle when he tried to dethrone Edward again - this time with the support of the Lancastrian queen - he was killed in battle and Elizabeth's curse was almost fulfilled.\nPeace was restored to England once more but George became frustrated and tried to cause trouble yet again - by accusing Elizabeth of cursing him and murdering his wife Isabel. He was tried for treason and found guilty.\nElizabeth regretted her decision to curse George - even though he executed her father - and merely wished for peace. However Edward could not appear weak and George chose to be executed by being drowned by Malmsey Wine - which was Elizabeth's favorite.\nElizabeth was shown to be a complex character. In The Lady of the Rivers , she was portrayed as a sweet, serene, and tactful young woman who was passionately devoted to her family, and harboured bright hopes for the future. Her deep intelligence and innate curiosity led her to secretly study the arts of magic and clairvoyance under her mother's guidance, though she is far more cautious about such things than her mother. She seemed to care little for power or wealth, and her greatest wish was for her family - especially her children - to be safe and secure.\nIn The White Queen , as a widowed mother of two sons, Elizabeth had grown wiser, more worldly, but also far more cynical, once describing herself as \"far beyond loyalty to anyone\" but her sons and herself. Though she still shared an exceptionally intimate relationship with her mother, she now expressed doubts in her mother's wisdom as well as in the magic of their goddess-ancestress, Melusina - something that she never would have done during her childhood and teenage years. She also demonstrated a rebellious streak that the then-patriarchal society would frown upon in a woman - declaring that she had loyalties and obligations that were \"not at the beck and call of any man\" .\nIn the midst of this, however, Elizabeth still occasionally followed her heart instead of her head, as shown by her marrying Edward IV for love, and the fact that she had become Queen of England only occurred to her after they were wed.\nLater in the novels, however, she becomes more fixated on reclaiming her children's \"rightful\" inheritance after it is stolen from them by Richard III. Elizabeth becomes less carefree after her brother and father are killed, showing a colder and more vengeful side. Elizabeth vows to bring down those who have harmed or threatened her loved ones, showing little remorse for it. However, she is shown to be disturbed or remorseful for some of her other morally questionable actions, such as supposedly creating a storm that inadvertently contributes to Isabel Neville's miscarriage, or standing by whilst her husband and brothers-in-law murder Henry VI.\nSir John Grey of Groby was Elizabeth's first husband, and as revealed in The Lady of the Rivers , their marriage was simultaneously a political alliance yet true love match that Jacquetta foresaw and arranged. Apparently, when Jacquetta sent Elizabeth to be trained by Lady Elizabeth Ferrers (John Grey's mother) on how to be a true lady of a vast estate, her other motive was her confidence that John would eventually fall in love with Elizabeth.

Unfortunately, John was later killed during the Second Battle of St Albans, leaving Elizabeth widowed. Though she was truly devastated by his death, she still managed to bear her loss with dignity.\nElizabeth Woodville was the wife of King Edward.

Her daughter once reflected this magical effect as \"it was almost as if the pains floated away on her words\" .\nElizabeth Woodville was born in about 1437 at Grafton Manor, as the oldest child of Richard and Jacquetta Woodville. Despite the scandal of Jacquetta's marriage to a man of unequal rank, she continued to serve Margaret of Anjou as her chief lady-in-waiting, and it was possible that Elizabeth had been present at the Lancastrian court.\nIn 1452, Elizabeth married Sir John Grey, and had two sons: Thomas and Richard Grey. However, when John died at the Second Battle of St Albans in 1461, Elizabeth lost her lands and her children's inheritance.\nIn May 1464, Elizabeth married the York King of England, Edward IV, in secret, but it was revealed at a Privy Council meeting during which marriage negotiations for the King were discussed. The revelation of this marriage caused a rift between Edward and Warwick, and set in stone a mutual dislike between Elizabeth and Warwick as well. Elizabeth was officially crowned as the Queen of England on the 26th of May, 1465. With her coronation, the Woodville family was highly elevated, and sought ambitious marriages and titles, leading to the family being hated by many at court. In particular, Warwick and George Clarence disliked the Woodville family's growing influence so much that they revolted twice before fleeing to France to ally with Margaret of Anjou.\nWarwick later returned to England with an army to restore Henry VI, which resulted in Edward fleeing to exile, and Elizabeth and her children seeking sanctuary. During her time in sanctuary, she gave birth to a son, Edward, and remained in Sanctuary until Warwick was killed in battle and Edward was restored to the throne in 1471.\nDespite Edward's infidelities, he and Elizabeth were known to have a happy marriage that produced a total of ten children, which included Richard of Shrewsbury (the 1st Duke of York) and Elizabeth of York.\nElizabeth Woodville's portrait by unknown\nIn 1483, Elizabeth's fortunes changed again with Edward's death: her young son, Edward, became King Edward V of England, with Duke Richard of Gloucester (his uncle) acting as Lord Protector, and Elizabeth became Queen Dowager. However, Elizabeth distrusted Gloucester and took her children back into sanctuary. Shortly after, Gloucester took both of Elizabeth's sons and placed them in the Tower of London, where they mysteriously disappeared.\nDuring this time, William Hastings was executed along with a few of Elizabeth's male relatives, for treason and apparently conspiring with Elizabeth. Gloucester was crowned on 25 June 1483 and one of the first acts he passed denounced Elizabeth and Edward's marriage as unlawful and their children disinherited and bastards. Elizabeth was stripped of her titles and was referred to as Dame Elizabeth Grey.\nElizabeth was not contented to be disregarded and made several plans to restore her son to the throne and overthrow Gloucester. When rumours of her son's death reached her, Elizabeth changed her plans and arranged the marriage between her eldest daughter Elizabeth and Henry Tudor the Lancastrian heir. During this time Elizabeth conspired closely with Margaret Beaufort. However on 1 March 1484, Elizabeth and her daughters came out of sanctuary after Gloucester publicly swore an oath not to harm any of them. The Woodvilles returned returned to court and outwardly reconciled with Gloucester. After the death of Gloucester's wife, Anne Neville, in March 1485, rumours arose that the King was going to marry his beautiful and young niece Elizabeth of York. Gloucester issued a denial and it is not known what Elizabeth thought of these rumours.\nKing Edward IV and His Queen, Elizabeth Woodville at Reading Abbey, 1464 by Ernest BoardIn 1485, Henry Tudor invaded England and defeated Gloucester at the Battle of Bosworth Field. As King, Henry VII married Elizabeth of York and had the Titulus Regius revoked. Elizabeth Woodville was accorded the title and honours of a queen dowager. However it was made clear that Elizabeth was not welcome at court and Elizabeth spent the last five years of her life living at Bermondsey Abbey. At Bermondsey Abbey, Elizabeth was treated with all the respect due to a queen dowager, lived a regal life. She also attended royal events and births. Henry VII briefly contemplated marrying his mother-in-law off to King James III of Scotland but James died before anything was arranged.\nElizabeth Woodville died at Bermondsey Abbey on 8 June 1492. Elizabeth Woodville's will specified a simple ceremony and surviving accounts of her funeral suggest that at least one source \"clearly felt that a queen's funeral should have been more splendid\" and may have objected that \"Henry VII had not seen fit to arrange a more queenly funeral for his mother-in-law\", despite the fact that the simplicity was the queen dowager's own wish. Elizabeth was laid to rest in the same chantry as her husband King Edward IV in St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle.", "source_raw_text": "Elizabeth Woodville was the protagonist of The White Queen as well as one of the main characters in several of the other Cousin's War novels. She was the oldest daughter and child of Richard and Jacquetta Woodville , the Queen Consort of Edward IV , and the mother of the Princes in the Tower and Elizabeth of York . Elizabeth and her family were loyal to the House of Lancaster until her marriage to Edward IV, the heir of the House of York. Her previous loyalties and commoner status made her an unpopular consort, and she quickly gained enemies, especially in Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick , and George, Duke of Clarence . Despite her lack of popularity, Elizabeth still gave her all to the House of York: she was a faithful loving wife to her husband, an attentive devoted mother to all her children, and overall a strong, shrewd, and courageous Queen. She was also famed as the most beautiful Queen that England had ever seen, and was rumored by some - especially her enemies - to be a real witch with genuine supernatural powers. While she herself never verified these rumors to others, Elizabeth did possess magical powers due to her being a descendant of the Water Goddess Melusina , and she practiced these abilities in secret to aid herself and her family. In the BBC television series adaptation of The White Queen , she is portrayed by Rebecca Ferguson. After being widowed and losing her lands, Elizabeth decides to appeal to the new York king, Edward IV, to help her. Edward agrees to assist her in getting her lands back, but the pair are also strongly attracted to each other upon sight and eventually fall in love. Even though Elizabeth is a widow, a commoner, and belongs to a family originally loyal to Lancaster, Edward decides to marry her. Feeling that he cannot live without her and vice versa. The pair marry in secret, with only a priest, choir boy, a lady-in-waiting and Elizabeth's mother in attendance. Elizabeth's brother Anthony is convinced that Edward tricked Elizabeth into a fake marriage just so he could sleep with her. Elizabeth refuses to believe this and despite underlying doubts, she is certain that Edward will be faithful to her. This is later proved true, as Edward announces that he has married Elizabeth and has her brought to court, where she is crowned Queen of England. Although Elizabeth is happy in her new marriage, her sudden rise to greatness earns her many enemies, including Duchess Cecily, her new mother-in-law, and Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick , Edward's adviser. Some even whisper that she used witchcraft to make the king fall in love with her, though she pays little attention to these rumors. Elizabeth does her best to make her family powerful and wealthy, to protect them, and supports Edward in all that he does. She also bears him several daughters, the eldest of whom, named Elizabeth after her, she believes has the Sight. Eventually, though, war breaks out again. Elizabeth is forced to flee into sanctuary at Westminster Abbey on a number of occasions, and actually gives birth to Edward's first son, Edward V, there. Elizabeth is devastated when she learns her father and brother John have been captured and beheaded on Warwick's orders, without trial. As a result, she places a curse on Warwick and George Duke of Clarence , whom she also holds responsible, praying to Melusina that they shall die and thus pay for the deaths of her family. Elizabeth also uses magic to 'make' a storm at sea to prevent Warwick's ships from escaping to Calais; this inadvertently results in his daughter, Isabel , suffering a miscarriage, for which Elizabeth feels guilty. Elizabeth bears Edward yet more children and encourages him to execute George after he is found to have plotting against his brother - George also accused Elizabeth of murdering his wife Isabel, and executed a servant woman whom Elizabeth had placed in George's household as a spy. However, she was innocent of playing any part in Isabel's death. After Edward dies, Elizabeth's brother-in-law Richard Duke of Gloucester seizes the throne; he declares that Elizabeth's marriage to Edward was not legal - therefore, their sons are bastards and cannot inherit the throne, and Elizabeth is stripped of her title. Elizabeth goes into sanctuary and plots to protect her children and reclaim their inheritance. She is forced to send her sons with Edward, Edward and Richard, as hostages. Not trusting Richard, Elizabeth secretly sends a pageboy disguised as Richard in his place and sends the real Richard to a safehouse overseas. The boys later disappear and Elizabeth fears that Edward has been killed. She allies herself with Margaret Beaufort to fight King Richard, believing that he is responsible for her son's death; she also puts a curse on Richard that causes his sword arm to weaken. When Elizabeth learns from Richard that he didn't kill her son, she is unsure of what to believe. She and her daughter Elizabeth place a curse on whomever is responsible, that they and their first-born son and grandson should all die, leaving only girls to inherit (as it is implied that Margaret and her son Henry Tudor are responsible for Edward V's murder, this foreshadows the events of the Tudor Court novels, in which Henry's firstborn Arthur dies young from illness, Henry VIII's first son dies in infancy and his only living son dies without children, leaving only his daughters, Mary and Elizabeth). The novel ends with Elizabeth hoping that Henry Tudor will be killed at the Battle of Bosworth and that she can bring Richard safely home and reclaim the throne for him. Jacquetta takes a special mixture of herbs in order to conceive Elizabeth, her first child, resulting in her marrying her lover Richard. Jacquetta is certain that Elizabeth has inherited her gift of Sight and other powers from their water goddess ancestor, Melusina. Jacquetta teaches Elizabeth all that she knows about magic. Elizabeth later falls in love with Sir John Grey and marries him, becoming lady of Groby Hall. Jacquetta, however, 'Sees' that their relationship will have no future, but does not tell Elizabeth this. Elizabeth gives birth to two sons, Richard and Thomas. Her husband fights for the House of Lancaster in the Cousin's War. Unfortunately, John is killed during the battle of St Albans. Elizabeth's mother-in-law refuses to give her her dowry lands, forcing a now penniless Elizabeth and her sons to move in with her parents and live off their charity. Jacquetta, however, predicts that Elizabeth has a great destiny ahead of her yet. In the Kingmaker's Daughter, Elizabeth is a endless source of admiration, disdain and mistrust for the Neville Daughters. The novel opens in May 1465 as the Neville family arrive at the Tower of London to pay homage to the new queen consort Elizabeth Woodville . Edward\u2019s choice in bride is met with disapproval by Warwick and as a wife and two daughters; Anne and Isabel . When presented to the new queen, Young Anne is mesmerized by her beauty and her open adoration for the queen is a source of embarrassment for her mother and sister who dislike Elizabeth immensely. Warwick and Duchess Cecily are notably absent and in their absence Jacquetta Woodville presides over the proceedings. Later that evening as they prepare for bed, Anne praises Elizabeth\u2019s beauty while Isabel haughtily criticizes Elizabeth\u2019s conduct and says if that she were queen she would be \u201ca true Queen, a Queen of ice\u201d. The girls make a game of playing \u201cQueen of England\u201d until a fight breaks out between the two and they are put to bed to get rest for Elizabeth\u2019s coronation in the morning. By July, Anne and Isabel Neville are asked to join the Queen's household; an honor which Warwick turns down due to his enmity of Elizabeth. Over the next two years, Elizabeth encroaches on Warwick\u2019s influence over Edward and drives a wedge between the two cousins. Anne and Isabel are equally dismayed that the Woodville daughters are married to wealthy noblemen and this diminishes their own marriage prospects. Warwick intends for his daughters to marry the royal dukes, Richard and George, but Elizabeth is against the marriages for they would make the ambitious Warwick over mighty. This forces Warwick to marry Isabel to George without the king's permission and further the hostility between Edward and Warwick. After the wedding, Warwick decides to go to war against Edward to rid England of the Woodvilles. Warwick is swift in his revolt against Edward: executing Elizabeth\u2019s father and brother, placing her mother on trial for witchcraft and imprisoning Edward himself. Elizabeth goes into sanctuary while the Nevilles revel in their triumph over Elizabeth. Isabel alone is the only one that worries about there being multiple queen's in England. Her caution is warranted for Warwick restores Edward and so Elizabeth. The Nevilles are brought to court to show their loyalty to the restored queen Elizabeth. Anne and Isabel are apprehensive of approaching Elizabeth, who coldly regards them, and Jacquetta who is openly hostile swearing her enmity and blows a whistle that snuffs out a candle by Isabel\u2019s side. Despite their treason and imprisonment of the king, the Nevilles must play the part of loyal subjects and take great pains to involve themselves at court with Isabel and Anne being invited into the queen\u2019s household as ladies-in-waiting. While their appointment was a gracious gesture from Edward the girls are frightened by prospect of serving Elizabeth. Elizabeth\u2019s treatment of the girls is intolerable for she openly ignores them. However Anne never faults Elizabeth for this for she is ashamed and knows that her family acting in the wrong. Anne\u2019s unhappiness manifests into sickness and her mother informs her to stop complaining as they all are suffering because of Warwick\u2019s miscalculated gamble. Anne hopes that they all will be happier when they leave court for Isabel\u2019s confinement however upon arrival at Warwick castle they quickly discover that Warwick is planning to place George on the English throne. Warwick's plan fails and they must flee to Calais to spare their lives and regroup. The family make their way to Devon and are pleased to see that the weather is fair and the sea is calm which will aid their escape. However as they board the ship they see at Warwick\u2019s horse, midnight, is nervous and Isabel herself is increasingly fearful and refusing to board the ship until Warwick sternly forces her. By nightfall a storm (implied to have been sent by Elizabeth Woodville) is gathering as Isabel goes into labor. The storm intensifies as Isabel\u2019s labor becomes increasingly difficult and they are refused entry into Calais on the grounds that Calais has stayed loyal to York and not to Warwick. With no alternative and no means to fetch a doctor; Anne with her slender hands must reposition Isabel\u2019s baby and deliver it. Isabel gives birth but to a stillborn son. Miraculously the ship survives the storm and the family sail to Paris. Their mother removed the dead baby and they believe that it was tossed overboard. George is displeased with the news about the baby (particularly as Elizabeth is pregnant again) while Isabel firmly believes that her child would have lived had it not been for Elizabeth\u2019s curse. It is at Elizabeth's behest that Princess Lizzie and all the remaining royal York children are brought to London after the decisive battle of Bosworth. Elizabeth urges Lizzie to forget about her relationship with Richard and to focus on her future as the new king's intended bride. She delights at being reunited with her children though coolly deflects Cecily's comments about Henry rejecting Lizzie and her relationship with Richard. When Cecily is dismissed, Elizabeth informs Lizzie that Lady Margaret all but rules the court and they must endure her until Lizzie is crowned Queen. The Yorks wait for invitation or visit from King Henry yet he pointedly holds court without them. Henry's invasion of England brought a mysterious new disease, the Sweating Sickness, that ravages England and delays Henry's coronation. Lizzie questions her mother on whether or nor the sickness was wrought by her powers which amuses Elizabeth. During the moment of intimacy, Elizabeth confirms that Prince Richard is safe but will say no more. Elizabeth was married to Sir John Grey, who died at the Second Battle of St Albans in 1461 fighting for the Lancastrian king, Henry VI. Elizabeth's father, Baron Rivers, also supported the House of Lancaster. Her mother Jacquetta was a relation to both Henry VI and his wife Margaret of Anjou. One morning Elizabeth begged the new York king, Edward IV, for mercy and to have her late husband's land returned to her and her two sons. Edward \u2013 who had a reputation as a bit of a playboy \u2013 fell for her instantly. Edward wanted Elizabeth to be his mistress, but she refused. She even put a knife to her own neck to ward off his advances. Edward went to battle and Elizabeth missed him terribly. When he returned he asked her to marry her and she agreed. They had a secret wedding, and Edward announced their marriage to a shocked court and a furious Warwick. When Warwick convinced George to fight for his brother's crown, the country was at war again. Elizabeth's father and brothers fought for the King and were executed by Warwick. Elizabeth and her mother were heartbroken and vengeful. Jacquetta, who dabbled in witchcraft, helped Elizabeth curse Warwick and George. Warwick was killed in battle when he tried to dethrone Edward again - this time with the support of the Lancastrian queen - he was killed in battle and Elizabeth's curse was almost fulfilled. Peace was restored to England once more but George became frustrated and tried to cause trouble yet again - by accusing Elizabeth of cursing him and murdering his wife Isabel. He was tried for treason and found guilty. Elizabeth regretted her decision to curse George - even though he executed her father - and merely wished for peace. However Edward could not appear weak and George chose to be executed by being drowned by Malmsey Wine - which was Elizabeth's favorite. Elizabeth was shown to be a complex character. In The Lady of the Rivers , she was portrayed as a sweet, serene, and tactful young woman who was passionately devoted to her family, and harboured bright hopes for the future. Her deep intelligence and innate curiosity led her to secretly study the arts of magic and clairvoyance under her mother's guidance, though she is far more cautious about such things than her mother. She seemed to care little for power or wealth, and her greatest wish was for her family - especially her children - to be safe and secure. In The White Queen , as a widowed mother of two sons, Elizabeth had grown wiser, more worldly, but also far more cynical, once describing herself as \"far beyond loyalty to anyone\" but her sons and herself. Though she still shared an exceptionally intimate relationship with her mother, she now expressed doubts in her mother's wisdom as well as in the magic of their goddess-ancestress, Melusina - something that she never would have done during her childhood and teenage years. She also demonstrated a rebellious streak that the then-patriarchal society would frown upon in a woman - declaring that she had loyalties and obligations that were \"not at the beck and call of any man\" . In the midst of this, however, Elizabeth still occasionally followed her heart instead of her head, as shown by her marrying Edward IV for love, and the fact that she had become Queen of England only occurred to her after they were wed. Later in the novels, however, she becomes more fixated on reclaiming her children's \"rightful\" inheritance after it is stolen from them by Richard III. Elizabeth becomes less carefree after her brother and father are killed, showing a colder and more vengeful side. Elizabeth vows to bring down those who have harmed or threatened her loved ones, showing little remorse for it. However, she is shown to be disturbed or remorseful for some of her other morally questionable actions, such as supposedly creating a storm that inadvertently contributes to Isabel Neville's miscarriage, or standing by whilst her husband and brothers-in-law murder Henry VI. Sir John Grey of Groby was Elizabeth's first husband, and as revealed in The Lady of the Rivers , their marriage was simultaneously a political alliance yet true love match that Jacquetta foresaw and arranged. Apparently, when Jacquetta sent Elizabeth to be trained by Lady Elizabeth Ferrers (John Grey's mother) on how to be a true lady of a vast estate, her other motive was her confidence that John would eventually fall in love with Elizabeth. Elizabeth herself was charmed by the handsome, kind-hearted, and well-mannered John, to the extent where she felt shy and foolish around him. Later on, on her mother's advice, she plucked an apple from the prettiest apple tree in his orchard, and gave him half to eat with honey, while she kept the other half for herself. Just as Jacquetta foresaw, John and Elizabeth were eventually happily married, and even came to have two sons. Unfortunately, John was later killed during the Second Battle of St Albans, leaving Elizabeth widowed. Though she was truly devastated by his death, she still managed to bear her loss with dignity. Elizabeth Woodville was the wife of King Edward. It is shown that she does truly love her husband the king, and that they both have a real desire for each other. She dislikes his whoring tendencies, but puts up with it. \"...hear the crowd murmur that I am a beauty beyond their imaginings.\" \"...You have that gift, which our mother had, of growing older and becoming more lovely. Your features have changed from being merely those of a pretty girl to being those of a beautiful woman with a face like a carving...\" Elizabeth was famed as and acknowledged to be the most beautiful woman England had ever seen: tall and voluptuous, with a thick silky mane of long silver-blond hair, striking deep grey eyes, clear pearlescent skin, an angelic smile, and perfectly regular features that made \"statues look stodgy\" and \"painted Madonnas look coarse\" in comparison. It was said that only her mother, Jacquetta, was able to match her for looks when she had been in her prime, and even Elizabeth's bitterest enemies (such as Margaret Beaufort ) could not dispute her beauty and grace. As Elizabeth aged, her ravishing beauty not only remained apparent, but also seemed to be enhanced by time - her brother, Anthony, commented that her loveliness actually increased with her age. Her daughter, Elizabeth of York , also once observed that even with blond hair streaked with grey, her mother was still \"as beautiful as a timeless Angel\" . \"I don't claim to be a witch,\" I say quietly, \"But I have Melusina's inheritance. I am her heir. You know what I mean: I have her gift, just as Mother did. Just as my daughter Elizabeth has. The world sings to me and I hear the song. Things come to me; my wishes come true. Dreams speak to me. I see signs and portents. And sometimes I know what will happen in the future. I have the Sight.\" As a descendant of the Water Goddess Melusina , Elizabeth possessed supernatural powers and arcane knowledge that had been honed by her mother's training and her own practice. Examples of powers Elizabeth possessed are:  Magic:  As shown in  The Lady of the Rivers  , when she was only fourteen-years-old, Elizabeth was secretly trained by her mother, Jacquetta, in the art of manipulating supernatural or mystical energy to alter the fabric of reality and defy the laws of nature. Though Elizabeth never claimed to be a true witch like many of her enemies were quick to accuse her of being, she still emerged as a potent, if sometimes ineffective, practitioner of the mystic arts with time. Examples of abilities she derived from her magic are:  Wishing/Reality Warping: Elizabeth had the ability to manipulate reality itself so that her wishes would come true, but she had to \"put aside favour and indulgence\" and be \"pure in heart\" in order to effectively use this ability. Cursing: Elizabeth had the ability to cast spells or magical enchantments that were designed to cause negative effects to occur. Despite her mother's wishes and warnings, the ability of cursing became one of Elizabeth's most commonly-employed powers due to her numerous enemies, her familial losses, and her frequent changes in fortunes. She was shown to use this ability in a variety of ways - causing Warwick and George to die shameful deaths, striking Richard down with a painful weakness in his sword arm and chest, and even - unintentionally, perhaps - bringing about the end of the Tudor line by causing it to ultimately produce only infertile daughters. Her curses were shown to be always ruthlessly effective on her intended victims, but they also had a tendency to spiral out of control and include other innocents in their negative impacts, and once they had been cast, they are irrevocable even by her own descendants.  Divination:  Elizabeth was skillful in the practice of predicting the future, having been secretly trained by her mother in the art of reading tarot cards. Another ability she derived from this province is:  Divine Communication: Elizabeth had the ability to communicate with her ancestress, the Goddess Melusina, through rivers to either find answers to her questions or to appeal for supernatural help in pressing matters. While she initially appeared to have to use her mother's charm bracelet to utilise this ability, it was gradually revealed that she did not need to - all she had to do would be to write her \"petition\" on a piece of paper, fold it into a little boat, and set it flowing on any river that was nearby, which would lead it directly into Melusina's supernatural kingdom to be read and granted accordingly.

Premonition: Elizabeth had the ability to see and experience events from the past, present, and future, which manifested itself in the form of dreams, or visions, or omens, or even a sensation of foreboding. Like her mother, she referred these supernatural glimpses as \"Seeings\" . Atmokinesis: Elizabeth had the ability to control and manipulate the weather to various effects. This was also one of Elizabeth's most commonly-employed powers, and arguably the strongest offensive magical ability she possessed. She was shown to have used it to whistle up winds, breathe out heavy mists, and even conjure up terrible storms. Knowledge of Plants and the Otherworld: Elizabeth knew \"the properties of a hundred plants and how to call the venom out of them\" , and was even knowledgeable in herbs that she would not find in a noblewoman's still room. She also knew how to utilize the forces of nature to find specific answers to certain questions, such as using a peeled wand to find water in underground springs, and her own wedding ring to determine the sex of her unborn child by watching the direction of its swing. Hypnosis/Persuasion: Elizabeth had the ability to affect or directly influence other people's minds to her commands. She used this power to dramatically reduce her daughter's childbirth pains and ensure that she made a safe successful delivery - looking at her daughter directly in the eye, holding her hands in hers, and speaking words of encouragement and love to her in a soothing whispering voice. Her daughter once reflected this magical effect as \"it was almost as if the pains floated away on her words\" .

Elizabeth Woodville was born in about 1437 at Grafton Manor, as the oldest child of Richard and Jacquetta Woodville. Despite the scandal of Jacquetta's marriage to a man of unequal rank, she continued to serve Margaret of Anjou as her chief lady-in-waiting, and it was possible that Elizabeth had been present at the Lancastrian court. In 1452, Elizabeth married Sir John Grey, and had two sons: Thomas and Richard Grey. However, when John died at the Second Battle of St Albans in 1461, Elizabeth lost her lands and her children's inheritance. In May 1464, Elizabeth married the York King of England, Edward IV, in secret, but it was revealed at a Privy Council meeting during which marriage negotiations for the King were discussed. The revelation of this marriage caused a rift between Edward and Warwick, and set in stone a mutual dislike between Elizabeth and Warwick as well. Elizabeth was officially crowned as the Queen of England on the 26th of May, 1465. With her coronation, the Woodville family was highly elevated, and sought ambitious marriages and titles, leading to the family being hated by many at court. In particular, Warwick and George Clarence disliked the Woodville family's growing influence so much that they revolted twice before fleeing to France to ally with Margaret of Anjou. Warwick later returned to England with an army to restore Henry VI, which resulted in Edward fleeing to exile, and Elizabeth and her children seeking sanctuary. During her time in sanctuary, she gave birth to a son, Edward, and remained in Sanctuary until Warwick was killed in battle and Edward was restored to the throne in 1471. Despite Edward's infidelities, he and Elizabeth were known to have a happy marriage that produced a total of ten children, which included Richard of Shrewsbury (the 1st Duke of York) and Elizabeth of York. Elizabeth Woodville's portrait by unknown In 1483, Elizabeth's fortunes changed again with Edward's death: her young son, Edward, became King Edward V of England, with Duke Richard of Gloucester (his uncle) acting as Lord Protector, and Elizabeth became Queen Dowager. However, Elizabeth distrusted Gloucester and took her children back into sanctuary. Shortly after, Gloucester took both of Elizabeth's sons and placed them in the Tower of London, where they mysteriously disappeared. During this time, William Hastings was executed along with a few of Elizabeth's male relatives, for treason and apparently conspiring with Elizabeth. Gloucester was crowned on 25 June 1483 and one of the first acts he passed denounced Elizabeth and Edward's marriage as unlawful and their children disinherited and bastards. Elizabeth was stripped of her titles and was referred to as Dame Elizabeth Grey. Elizabeth was not contented to be disregarded and made several plans to restore her son to the throne and overthrow Gloucester. When rumours of her son's death reached her, Elizabeth changed her plans and arranged the marriage between her eldest daughter Elizabeth and Henry Tudor the Lancastrian heir. During this time Elizabeth conspired closely with Margaret Beaufort. However on 1 March 1484, Elizabeth and her daughters came out of sanctuary after Gloucester publicly swore an oath not to harm any of them. The Woodvilles returned returned to court and outwardly reconciled with Gloucester. After the death of Gloucester's wife, Anne Neville, in March 1485, rumours arose that the King was going to marry his beautiful and young niece Elizabeth of York. Gloucester issued a denial and it is not known what Elizabeth thought of these rumours. King Edward IV and His Queen, Elizabeth Woodville at Reading Abbey, 1464 by Ernest BoardIn 1485, Henry Tudor invaded England and defeated Gloucester at the Battle of Bosworth Field. As King, Henry VII married Elizabeth of York and had the Titulus Regius revoked. Elizabeth Woodville was accorded the title and honours of a queen dowager. However it was made clear that Elizabeth was not welcome at court and Elizabeth spent the last five years of her life living at Bermondsey Abbey. At Bermondsey Abbey, Elizabeth was treated with all the respect due to a queen dowager, lived a regal life. She also attended royal events and births. Henry VII briefly contemplated marrying his mother-in-law off to King James III of Scotland but James died before anything was arranged. Elizabeth Woodville died at Bermondsey Abbey on 8 June 1492. Elizabeth Woodville's will specified a simple ceremony and surviving accounts of her funeral suggest that at least one source \"clearly felt that a queen's funeral should have been more splendid\" and may have objected that \"Henry VII had not seen fit to arrange a more queenly funeral for his mother-in-law\", despite the fact that the simplicity was the queen dowager's own wish. Elizabeth was laid to rest in the same chantry as her husband King Edward IV in St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle.", "documentFile": "https://philippagregory.fandom.com/wiki/Elizabeth_Woodville"}, {"source_title": "The White Princess Cast & Character Guide", "source_content_title": null, "source_date": "2020-04-15", "source_author": null, "documentText": ["By\nStarz' popular historical epic", "The White Princess featured Jodie Comer in a breakout role.", "Who else was in the show and who did they play?", "\nHere's a cast and character guide to Starz' The White Princess miniseries.", "Based on the book of the same name by Philippa Gregory, the show is a continuation of 2013's The White Queen , which had adapted three other Gregory novels.", "Although The White Queen was originally produced by the BBC, they opted not to forge ahead with a sequel.", "\nInstead, Starz scooped up the rights and produced The White Princess in 2017.", "The series follows the marriage of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York in late 15th Century England, unfolding over eight episodes.", "In real life, the union ended the Wars of the Roses, the fighting that took place between the families of Lancaster and York, which was the inspiration for the Lannisters and Starks in Game of Thrones .", "\nRelated:\nThe White Princess sees the tensions continue to simmer thanks to the machinations of the matriarchs of each family.", "The White Princess currently sits at 76% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and has spawned a second sequel with The Spanish Princess .", "Here's a cast and character guide for The White Princess .", "\nJodie Comer - Princess Elizabeth 'Lizzie' York\nElizabeth York, the niece of Richard III, is set to marry Henry Tudor after he defeats Richard on the battlefield.", "Henry is the new King of England, and 'Lizzie' must marry him to ensure peace between their families.", "She protests, insisting all she ever wanted was to marry for love.", "Henry insists on impregnating Lizzie before their wedding, which she agrees to in order to ensure her mother's survival and their ongoing plot to return the York family to power.", "\nLizzie is played by Jodie Comer , whose star continues to rise after a thrilling turn on Phoebe Waller-Bridge's adaptation of Killing Eve .", "The Liverpool, England native can next be seen on the big screen in Free Guy with Ryan Reynolds and Taika Waititi.\nJacob Collins-Levy - Henry VII\nJacob Collins-Levy plays Henry VII, who ascends to the throne of England at the beginning of The White Princess .", "Henry is influenced by the machinations of his mother, who constantly whispers in his ear.", "His driving goal is maintaining order and retaining his rule over England, whilst attempting to expose York subterfuge, all the while attempting to resist Lizzie's charms.", "Collins-Levy can next be seen in True History of the Kelly Gang , alongside George Mackay .", "\nMichelle Fairley - Margaret Beaufort\nMichelle Fairley played matriarch Catelyn Stark in Game of Thrones and in The White Princess , she plays another King's mother; this time, Margaret Beaufort, mother to Henry VII.", "Margaret is responsible for briefly imprisoning Lizzie's mother so that she is unable to scour the country for York supporters.", "Margaret's greatest crime is ordering the infamous murder of the Princes in the Tower.", "\nRelated:\nEssie Davis - Elizabeth Woodville\nElizabeth Woodville, AKA the White Queen, was the main character of the preceding series The White Queen .", "Previously played by Rebecca Ferguson", "( Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation ), Woodville is played in The White Princess by Essie Davis, well known for The Babadook .", "Woodville's arc in The White Princess traces her attempts to restore the York family to power, following her husband's defeat at the hands of Henry Tudor.", "\nRebecca Benson - Margaret 'Maggie' Plantagenet\nMaggie Plantagenet is the Queen's paternal cousin, who attempts to protect her little brother Teddy from the machinations of Margaret Beaufort.", "She is played by Rebecca Benson, who also appeared on Game of Thrones as Sam Tarly's sister, Talla.", "\nSuki Waterhouse - Cecily York\nCecily York is the Queen's sister.", "She has a small role in The White Princess , being portrayed as jealous of her sister's ascendance to the throne.", "Cecily is played by Suki Waterhouse, who has gone on to forge her own impressive career, with appearances in Detective Pikachu and Divergent sequel, Insurgent .", "\nNext:"], "rawDocumentText": "By\nStarz' popular historical epic The White Princess featured Jodie Comer in a breakout role.

American Dream is the national ethos of the United States , a set of ideals including representative democracy , rights , liberty , and equality , in which freedom is interpreted as the opportunity for individual prosperity and success, as well as upward social mobility for oneself and their children, achieved through hard work in a capitalist society with few barriers.\nThe term \"American Dream\" was coined by James Truslow Adams in 1931, saying that \"life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement\" regardless of social class or circumstances of birth . [1]\nProponents of the American Dream often claim that its tenets originate from the United States Declaration of Independence , which states that \" all men are created equal \" with the right to \" life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness \". [2] The Preamble to the U.S. Constitution is used similarly. It states that the Constitution's purpose is to, in part, \"secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity\". [a]\nThroughout American history, there have been critics of its national ethos. Some critics point out that American focus on individualism and capital results in materialism, consumerism and a lack of worker solidarity. [3] In 2015, only 10.5 percent of American workers were members of a labor union. [4] The American Dream has also been criticized as a product of American exceptionalism , as it does not acknowledge the hardships many Americans face, namely in regards to the legacies of American slavery and Native American genocide , as well as other examples of discriminatory violence. [5]\nBelief in the American Dream is often inversely associated with rates of national disillusionment. Evidence indicates that upward economic mobility has declined and income inequality has risen in the United States in recent decades. [6] In 2020, a poll found only 54 percent of US adults thought the American Dream was attainable for them, 28 percent believed it was unattainable for them personally, while 9 percent rejected the idea of the American Dream entirely. Younger generations were also less likely to believe in the American Dream than their older counterparts. [7]\nThis section needs expansion . You can help by . ( November 2022 )\nThe meaning of the American Dream has changed over the course of history, and includes both personal components such as home ownership and upward mobility as well as a global vision for cultural hegemony and diplomacy.\nHistorically, the Dream originated in colonial mystique regarding frontier life . As John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore , the colonial Governor of Virginia , noted in 1774, the Americans \"for ever imagine the Lands further off are still better than those upon which they are already settled\". He added that, \"if they attained Paradise, they would move on if they heard of a better place farther west\". [8]\nMany well-educated Germans who fled the failed 1848 revolution found the United States more politically free than their homeland, which they believed to be a hierarchical and aristocratic society that determined the ceiling for their aspirations. One of them claimed:\nThe German emigrant comes into a country free from the despotism, privileged orders and monopolies, intolerable taxes, and constraints in matters of belief and conscience. Everyone can travel and settle wherever he pleases. No passport is demanded, no police mingles in his affairs or hinders his movements ... Fidelity and merit are the only sources of honor here. The rich stand on the same footing as the poor; the scholar is not a mug above the most humble mechanics; no German ought to be ashamed to pursue any occupation ... [In America] wealth and possession of real estate confer not the least political right on its owner above what the poorest citizen has. Nor are there nobility, privileged orders, or standing armies to weaken the physical and moral power of the people, nor are there swarms of public functionaries to devour in idleness credit for. Above all, there are no princes and corrupt courts representing the so-called divine 'right of birth'. In such a country the talents, energy and perseverance of a person ... have far greater opportunity to display than in monarchies. [9]\nThe discovery of gold in California in 1849 brought in a hundred thousand men looking for their fortune overnight\u2014and a few did find it. Thus was born the California Dream of instant success. Historian H. W. Brands noted that in the years after the Gold Rush, the California Dream spread across the nation:\nThe old American Dream ... was the dream of the Puritans, of Benjamin Franklin's \"Poor Richard\"... of men and women content to accumulate their modest fortunes a little at a time, year by year by year. The new dream was the dream of instant wealth, won in a twinkling by audacity and good luck. [This] golden dream ... became a prominent part of the American psyche only after Sutter's Mill . [10]\nHistorian Frederick Jackson Turner in 1893 advanced the frontier thesis , under which American democracy and the American Dream were formed by the American frontier. He stressed the process\u2014the moving frontier line\u2014and the impact it had on pioneers going through the process. He also stressed results; especially that American democracy was the primary result, along with egalitarianism , a lack of interest in high culture , and violence. \"American democracy was born of no theorist's dream; it was not carried in the Susan Constant to Virginia, nor in the Mayflower to Plymouth. It came out of the American forest, and it gained new strength each time it touched a new frontier,\" said Turner. [11] In the thesis, the American frontier established liberty by releasing Americans from European mindsets and eroding old, dysfunctional customs. The frontier had no need for standing armies, established churches, aristocrats or nobles, nor for landed gentry who controlled most of the land and charged heavy rents. Frontier land was free for the taking. Turner first announced his thesis in a paper entitled \" The Significance of the Frontier in American History \", delivered to the American Historical Association in 1893 in Chicago. He won wide acclaim among historians and intellectuals. Turner elaborated on the theme in his advanced history lectures and in a series of essays published over the next 25 years, published along with his initial paper as The Frontier in American History. [12] Turner's emphasis on the importance of the frontier in shaping American character influenced the interpretation found in thousands of scholarly histories. By the time Turner died in 1932, 60% of the leading history departments in the U.S. were teaching courses in frontier history along Turnerian lines. [13]\nFreelance writer James Truslow Adams popularized the phrase \"American Dream\" in his 1931 book Epic of America :\nBut there has been also the American dream , that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for every man, with opportunity for each according to his ability or achievement. It is a difficult dream for the European upper classes to interpret adequately, and too many of us ourselves have grown weary and mistrustful of it. It is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position... The American dream, that has lured tens of millions of all nations to our shores in the past century has not been a dream of merely material plenty, though that has doubtlessly counted heavily. It has been much more than that. It has been a dream of being able to grow to fullest development as man and woman, unhampered by the barriers which had slowly been erected in the older civilizations, unrepressed by social orders which had developed for the benefit of classes rather than for the simple human being of any and every class.

[21] The American Dream is also discussed in Arthur Miller 's Death of a Salesman as the play's protagonist, Willy, is on a quest for the American Dream.\nIn 2006, Dr. Guiyou Huang from St. Thomas University in Florida wrote a paper regarding the American Dream as a recurring theme in the fiction of Asian Americans. [22] [23]\nMany American authors added American ideals to their work as a theme or other reoccurring idea, to get their point across. [24] There are many ideals that appear in American literature such as, but not limited to, all people are equal, United States of America is the Land of Opportunity, independence is valued, The American Dream is attainable, and everyone can succeed with hard work and determination. John Winthrop also wrote about this term called, American exceptionalism . This ideology refers to the idea that Americans are, as a nation, elect. [25]\nThe American Dream has been credited with helping to build a cohesive American experience, but has also been blamed for inflated expectations. [27] Some commentators have noted that despite deep-seated belief in the egalitarian American Dream, the modern American wealth structure still perpetuates racial and class inequalities between generations. [28] One sociologist notes that advantage and disadvantage are not always connected to individual successes or failures, but often to prior position in a social group. [28]\nSince the 1920s, numerous authors, such as Sinclair Lewis in his 1922 novel Babbitt , and F. Scott Fitzgerald , in his 1925 classic, The Great Gatsby , satirized or ridiculed materialism in the chase for the American dream. For example, Jay Gatsby's death mirrors the American Dream's demise, reflecting the pessimism of modern-day Americans. [29] The American Dream is a main theme in the book by John Steinbeck , Of Mice and Men . The two friends George and Lennie dream of their own piece of land with a ranch , so they can \"live off the fatta the lan'\" and just enjoy a better life. The book later shows that not everyone can achieve the American Dream, although it is possible to achieve for a few. A lot of people follow the American Dream to achieve a greater chance of becoming rich. Some posit that the ease of achieving the American Dream changes with technological advances, availability of infrastructure and information, government regulations, state of the economy, and with the evolving cultural values of American demographics .\nIn 1949, Arthur Miller wrote Death of a Salesman , in which the American Dream is a fruitless pursuit. Similarly, in 1971 Hunter S. Thompson depicted in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey Into the Heart of the American Dream a dark psychedelic reflection of the concept\u2014successfully illustrated only in wasted pop-culture excess. [30]\nThe novel Requiem for a Dream by Hubert Selby Jr. is an exploration of the pursuit of American success as it turns delirious and lethal, told through the ensuing tailspin of its main characters. George Carlin famously wrote the joke \"it's called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it\". [31] Carlin pointed to \"the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions\" as having a greater influence than an individual's choice. [31] Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning journalist Chris Hedges echos this sentiment in his 2012 book Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt : [32]\nThe vaunted American dream, the idea that life will get better, that progress is inevitable if we obey the rules and work hard, that material prosperity is assured, has been replaced by a hard and bitter truth. The American dream, we now know, is a lie. We will all be sacrificed. The virus of corporate abuse\u2014the perverted belief that only corporate profit matters\u2014has spread to outsource our jobs, cut the budgets of our schools, close our libraries, and plague our communities with foreclosures and unemployment.\nThe American Dream, and the sometimes dark response to it, has been a long-standing theme in American film. [33] Many counterculture films of the 1960s and 1970s ridiculed the traditional quest for the American Dream. For example, Easy Rider (1969), directed by Dennis Hopper , shows the characters making a pilgrimage in search of \"the true America\" in terms of the hippie movement, drug use, and communal lifestyles. [34]\nScholars have explored the American Dream theme in the careers of numerous political leaders, including Henry Kissinger , [35] Hillary Clinton , [36] Benjamin Franklin, and Abraham Lincoln . [37] The theme has been used for many local leaders as well, such as Jos\u00e9 Antonio Navarro , the Tejano leader (1795\u20131871), who served in the legislatures of Coahuila y Texas, the Republic of Texas, and the State of Texas. [38]\nIn 2006 U.S. Senator Barack Obama wrote a memoir, The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream . It was this interpretation of the American Dream for a young black man that helped establish his statewide and national reputations. [39] [40] The exact meaning of the Dream became for at least one commentator a partisan political issue in the 2008 and 2012 elections. [41]\nPolitical conflicts, to some degree, have been ameliorated by the shared values of all parties in the expectation that the American Dream will resolve many difficulties and conflicts. [42]\nThe ethos today implies an opportunity for Americans to achieve prosperity through hard work. According to the Dream, this includes the opportunity for one's children to grow up and receive a good education and career without artificial barriers. It is the opportunity to make individual choices without the prior restrictions that limited people according to their class, caste, religion, race, or ethnicity. Immigrants to the United States sponsored ethnic newspapers in their own language; the editors typically promoted the American Dream. [43] Lawrence Samuel argues:\nFor many in both the working class and the middle class, upward mobility has served as the heart and soul of the American Dream, the prospect of \"betterment\" and to \"improve one's lot\" for oneself and one's children much of what this country is all about. \"Work hard, save a little, send the kids to college so they can do better than you did, and retire happily to a warmer climate\" has been the script we have all been handed. [44]\nA key element of the American Dream is promoting opportunity for one's children, Johnson interviewing parents says, \"This was one of the most salient features of the interview data: parents\u2014regardless of background\u2014relied heavily on the American Dream to understand the possibilities for children, especially their own children\". [45] Rank et al. argue, \"The hopes and optimism that Americans possess pertain not only to their own lives, but to their children's lives as well. A fundamental aspect of the American Dream has always been the expectation that the next generation should do better than the previous generation.\" [46]\n\"A lot of Americans think the U.S. has more social mobility than other western industrialized countries. This [study using medians instead of averages] makes it abundantly clear that we have less. Your circumstances at birth\u2014specifically, what your parents do for a living\u2014are an even bigger factor in how far you get in life than we had previously realized. Generations of Americans considered the United States to be a land of opportunity. This research raises some sobering questions about that image.\"\nMichael Hout , Professor of Sociology at New York University, 2018 [47]\nHanson and Zogby (2010) report on numerous public opinion polls that since the 1980s have explored the meaning of the concept for Americans, and their expectations for its future. In these polls, a majority of Americans consistently reported that for their family, the American Dream is more about spiritual happiness than material goods. Majorities state that working hard is the most important element for getting ahead. However, an increasing minority stated that hard work and determination does not guarantee success. Most Americans predict that achieving the Dream with fair means will become increasingly difficult for future generations. They are increasingly pessimistic about the opportunity for the working class to get ahead; on the other hand, they are increasingly optimistic about the opportunities available to poor people and to new immigrants. Furthermore, most support programs make special efforts to help minorities get ahead. [48]\nIn a 2013 poll by YouGov , 41% of responders said it is impossible for most to achieve the American Dream, while 38% said it is still possible. [49] Most Americans perceive a college education as the ticket to the American Dream. [50] Some recent observers warn that soaring student loan debt crisis and shortages of good jobs may undermine this ticket. [51] The point was illustrated in The Fallen American Dream , [52] a documentary film that details the concept of the American Dream from its historical origins to its current perception.\nResearch published in 2013 shows that the US provides, alongside the United Kingdom and Spain, the least economic mobility of any of 13 rich, democratic countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development . [54] [55] Prior research suggested that the United States shows roughly average levels of occupational upward mobility and shows lower rates of income mobility than comparable societies. [56] [57] Blanden et al. report, \"the idea of the US as 'the land of opportunity' persists; and clearly seems misplaced.\" [58] According to these studies, \"by international standards, the United States has an unusually low level of intergenerational mobility: our parents' income is highly predictive of our incomes as adults. Intergenerational mobility in the United States is lower than in France , Germany , Sweden , Canada , Finland , Norway and Denmark . Research in 2006 found that among high-income countries for which comparable estimates are available, only the United Kingdom had a lower rate of mobility than the United States.\" [59] Economist Isabel Sawhill concluded that \"this challenges the notion of America as the land of opportunity\". [60] [61] [62] Several public figures and commentators, from David Frum to Richard G. Wilkinson , have noted that the American dream is better realized in Denmark, which is ranked as having the highest social mobility in the OECD. [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] In the U.S., 50% of a father's income position is inherited by his son. In contrast, the amount in Norway or Canada is less than 20%. Moreover, in the U.S. 8% of children raised in the bottom 20% of the climbed to the top 20% as adult, while the figure in Denmark is nearly double at 15%. [68] [69] [70] In 2015, economist Joseph Stiglitz stated, \"Maybe we should be calling the American Dream the Scandinavian Dream.\" [71]\nIn the United States, home ownership is sometimes used as a proxy for achieving the promised prosperity; home ownership has been a status symbol separating the middle classes from the poor . [72]\nSometimes the Dream is identified with success in sports or how working class immigrants seek to join the American way of life. [73]\nAccording to a 2020 American Journal of Political Science study, Americans become less likely to believe in the attainability of the American dream as income inequality increases. [74] A 2022 study in the same journal found that exposure to \"rags-to-riches\" TV narratives makes Americans more likely to believe in upward mobility. [6]\nOwnby (1999) identifies four American Dreams that the new consumer culture addressed. The first was the \"Dream of Abundance\" offering a cornucopia of material goods to all Americans, making them proud to be the richest society on earth. The second was the \"Dream of a Democracy of Goods\" whereby everyone had access to the same products regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, or class, thereby challenging the aristocratic norms of the rest of the world whereby only the rich or well-connected are granted access to luxury. The \"Dream of Freedom of Choice\" with its ever-expanding variety of good allowed people to fashion their own particular lifestyle. Finally, the \"Dream of Novelty\", in which ever-changing fashions, new models, and unexpected new products broadened the consumer experience in terms of purchasing skills and awareness of the market, and challenged the conservatism of traditional society and culture, and even politics. Ownby acknowledges that the dreams of the new consumer culture radiated out from the major cities, but notes that they quickly penetrated the most rural and most isolated areas, such as rural Mississippi. With the arrival of the model T after 1910, consumers in rural America were no longer locked into local general stores with their limited merchandise and high prices in comparison to shops in towns and cities. Ownby demonstrates that poor black Mississippians shared in the new consumer culture, both inside Mississippi, and it motivated the more ambitious to move to Memphis or Chicago. [75] [76]\nThe aspirations of the \"American Dream\" in the broad sense of upward mobility have been systematically spread to other nations since the 1890s as American missionaries and businessmen consciously sought to spread the Dream, says Rosenberg. Looking at American business, religious missionaries, philanthropies, Hollywood , labor unions and Washington agencies, she says they saw their mission not in catering to foreign elites but instead reaching the world's masses in democratic fashion. \"They linked mass production , mass marketing, and technological improvement to an enlightened democratic spirit ... In the emerging litany of the American dream what historian Daniel Boorstin later termed a 'democracy of things' would disprove both Malthus 's predictions of scarcity and Marx 's of class conflict .\" It was, she says \"a vision of global social progress\". [77] Rosenberg calls the overseas version of the American Dream \"liberal-developmentalism\" and identified five critical components:\n(1) belief that other nations could and should replicate America's own developmental experience; (2) faith in private free enterprise; (3) support for free or open access for trade and investment; (4) promotion of free flow of information and culture; and (5) growing acceptance of [U.S.] governmental activity to protect private enterprise and to stimulate and regulate American participation in international economic and cultural exchange. [78]\nKnights and McCabe argued American management gurus have taken the lead in exporting the ideas: \"By the latter half of the twentieth century they were truly global and through them the American Dream continues to be transmitted, repackaged and sold by an infantry of consultants and academics backed up by an artillery of books and videos\". [79]\nIn West Germany after World War II , says Reiner Pommerin , \"the most intense motive was the longing for a better life, more or less identical with the American dream, which also became a German dream\". [80] Cassamagnaghi argues that to women in Italy after 1945, films and magazine stories about American life offered an \"American dream\". New York City especially represented a sort of utopia where every sort of dream and desire could become true. Italian women saw a model for their own emancipation from second class status in their patriarchal society . [81]\nThe American dream regarding home ownership had little resonance before the 1980s. [82] In the 1980s, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher worked to create a similar dream, by selling public-housing units to their tenants. Her Conservative Party called for more home ownership: \"HOMES OF OUR OWN: To most people ownership means first and foremost a home of their own ... We should like in time to improve on existing legislation with a realistic grants scheme to assist first-time buyers of cheaper homes.\" [83] Guest calls this Thatcher's approach to the American Dream. [84] Knights and McCabe argue that, \"a reflection and reinforcement of the American Dream has been the emphasis on individualism as extolled by Margaret Thatcher and epitomized by the 'enterprise' culture.\" [85]\nSince the fall of communism in the Soviet Union in 1991, the American Dream has fascinated Russians . [86] The first post-Communist leader Boris Yeltsin embraced the \"American way\" and teamed up with Harvard University free market economists Jeffrey Sachs and Robert Allison to give Russia economic shock therapy in the 1990s. The newly independent Russian media idealized America and endorsed shock therapy for the economy. [87] In 2008 Russian President Dmitry Medvedev lamented the fact that 77% of Russia's 142 million people live \"cooped up\" in apartment buildings. In 2010 his administration announced a plan for widespread home ownership: \"Call it the Russian dream\", said Alexander Braverman, the Director of the Federal Fund for the Promotion of Housing Construction Development. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , worried about his nation's very low birth rate , said he hoped home ownership will inspire Russians \"to have more babies\". [88]\nThe Chinese Dream describes a set of ideals in the People's Republic of China . It is used by journalists, government officials and activists to describe the aspiration of individual self-improvement in Chinese society. Although the phrase has been used previously by Western journalists and scholars, [89] [90] a translation of a New York Times article written by the American journalist Thomas Friedman , \"China Needs Its Own Dream\", has been credited with popularizing the concept in China. [90] He attributes the term to Peggy Liu and the environmental NGO JUCCCE's China Dream project, [91] [92] which defines the Chinese Dream as sustainable development . [92] In 2013, China's new paramount leader Xi Jinping began promoting the phrase as a slogan, leading to its widespread use in the Chinese media. [93]\nThe concept of Chinese Dream is very similar to the idea of \"American Dream\". It stresses entrepreneurship and glorifies a generation of self-made men and women in post- reform China, such as rural immigrants who moved to the urban centers and achieve magnificent improvement in terms of their living standards, and social life. Chinese Dream can be interpreted as the collective consciousness of Chinese people during the era of social transformation and economic progress. The idea was put forward by Chinese Communist Party new General Secretary Xi Jinping on November 29, 2012. The government hoped to revitalize China, while promoting innovation and technology to boost the international prestige of China. In this light, the Chinese Dream, like American exceptionalism , is a nationalistic concept as well.\nAccording to Ellen Brown , writing in 2019, over 90% of Chinese families own their own homes, giving the country one of the highest rates of home ownership in the world .

The American Dream is the national ethos of the United States , a set of ideals including representative democracy , rights , liberty , and equality , in which freedom is interpreted as the opportunity for individual prosperity and success, as well as upward social mobility for oneself and their children, achieved through hard work in a capitalist society with few barriers. The term \"American Dream\" was coined by James Truslow Adams in 1931, saying that \"life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement\" regardless of social class or circumstances of birth . [1] Proponents of the American Dream often claim that its tenets originate from the United States Declaration of Independence , which states that \" all men are created equal \" with the right to \" life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness \". [2] The Preamble to the U.S. Constitution is used similarly. It states that the Constitution's purpose is to, in part, \"secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity\". [a] Throughout American history, there have been critics of its national ethos. Some critics point out that American focus on individualism and capital results in materialism, consumerism and a lack of worker solidarity. [3] In 2015, only 10.5 percent of American workers were members of a labor union. [4] The American Dream has also been criticized as a product of American exceptionalism , as it does not acknowledge the hardships many Americans face, namely in regards to the legacies of American slavery and Native American genocide , as well as other examples of discriminatory violence. [5] Belief in the American Dream is often inversely associated with rates of national disillusionment. Evidence indicates that upward economic mobility has declined and income inequality has risen in the United States in recent decades. [6] In 2020, a poll found only 54 percent of US adults thought the American Dream was attainable for them, 28 percent believed it was unattainable for them personally, while 9 percent rejected the idea of the American Dream entirely. Younger generations were also less likely to believe in the American Dream than their older counterparts. [7] This section needs expansion . You can help by . ( November 2022 ) The meaning of the American Dream has changed over the course of history, and includes both personal components such as home ownership and upward mobility as well as a global vision for cultural hegemony and diplomacy. Historically, the Dream originated in colonial mystique regarding frontier life . As John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore , the colonial Governor of Virginia , noted in 1774, the Americans \"for ever imagine the Lands further off are still better than those upon which they are already settled\". He added that, \"if they attained Paradise, they would move on if they heard of a better place farther west\". [8] Many well-educated Germans who fled the failed 1848 revolution found the United States more politically free than their homeland, which they believed to be a hierarchical and aristocratic society that determined the ceiling for their aspirations. One of them claimed: The German emigrant comes into a country free from the despotism, privileged orders and monopolies, intolerable taxes, and constraints in matters of belief and conscience. Everyone can travel and settle wherever he pleases. No passport is demanded, no police mingles in his affairs or hinders his movements ... Fidelity and merit are the only sources of honor here. The rich stand on the same footing as the poor; the scholar is not a mug above the most humble mechanics; no German ought to be ashamed to pursue any occupation ... [In America] wealth and possession of real estate confer not the least political right on its owner above what the poorest citizen has. Nor are there nobility, privileged orders, or standing armies to weaken the physical and moral power of the people, nor are there swarms of public functionaries to devour in idleness credit for. Above all, there are no princes and corrupt courts representing the so-called divine 'right of birth'. In such a country the talents, energy and perseverance of a person ... have far greater opportunity to display than in monarchies. [9] The discovery of gold in California in 1849 brought in a hundred thousand men looking for their fortune overnight\u2014and a few did find it. Thus was born the California Dream of instant success. Historian H. W. Brands noted that in the years after the Gold Rush, the California Dream spread across the nation: The old American Dream ... was the dream of the Puritans, of Benjamin Franklin's \"Poor Richard\"... of men and women content to accumulate their modest fortunes a little at a time, year by year by year. The new dream was the dream of instant wealth, won in a twinkling by audacity and good luck. [This] golden dream ... became a prominent part of the American psyche only after Sutter's Mill . [10] Historian Frederick Jackson Turner in 1893 advanced the frontier thesis , under which American democracy and the American Dream were formed by the American frontier. He stressed the process\u2014the moving frontier line\u2014and the impact it had on pioneers going through the process. He also stressed results; especially that American democracy was the primary result, along with egalitarianism , a lack of interest in high culture , and violence. \"American democracy was born of no theorist's dream; it was not carried in the Susan Constant to Virginia, nor in the Mayflower to Plymouth. It came out of the American forest, and it gained new strength each time it touched a new frontier,\" said Turner. [11] In the thesis, the American frontier established liberty by releasing Americans from European mindsets and eroding old, dysfunctional customs. The frontier had no need for standing armies, established churches, aristocrats or nobles, nor for landed gentry who controlled most of the land and charged heavy rents. Frontier land was free for the taking. Turner first announced his thesis in a paper entitled \" The Significance of the Frontier in American History \", delivered to the American Historical Association in 1893 in Chicago. He won wide acclaim among historians and intellectuals. Turner elaborated on the theme in his advanced history lectures and in a series of essays published over the next 25 years, published along with his initial paper as The Frontier in American History. [12] Turner's emphasis on the importance of the frontier in shaping American character influenced the interpretation found in thousands of scholarly histories. By the time Turner died in 1932, 60% of the leading history departments in the U.S. were teaching courses in frontier history along Turnerian lines. [13] Freelance writer James Truslow Adams popularized the phrase \"American Dream\" in his 1931 book Epic of America : But there has been also the American dream , that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for every man, with opportunity for each according to his ability or achievement. It is a difficult dream for the European upper classes to interpret adequately, and too many of us ourselves have grown weary and mistrustful of it. It is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position... The American dream, that has lured tens of millions of all nations to our shores in the past century has not been a dream of merely material plenty, though that has doubtlessly counted heavily. It has been much more than that. It has been a dream of being able to grow to fullest development as man and woman, unhampered by the barriers which had slowly been erected in the older civilizations, unrepressed by social orders which had developed for the benefit of classes rather than for the simple human being of any and every class. [ citation needed ] Martin Luther King Jr. , in his \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail\" (1963) rooted the civil rights movement in the African-American quest for the American Dream: [14] We will win our freedom because the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing demands ... when these disinherited children of God sat down at lunch counters they were in reality standing up for what is best in the American dream and for the most sacred values in our Judeo-Christian heritage, thereby bringing our nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the Founding Fathers in their formulation of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence . The concept of the American Dream has been used in popular discourse, and scholars have traced its use in American literature ranging from the Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin , [15] to Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), Willa Cather's My \u00c1ntonia , [16] F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1925), Theodore Dreiser's An American Tragedy (1925) and Toni Morrison 's Song of Solomon (1977). [17] Other writers who used the American Dream theme include Hunter S. Thompson , Edward Albee , [18] John Steinbeck , [19] Langston Hughes , [20] and Giannina Braschi . [21] The American Dream is also discussed in Arthur Miller 's Death of a Salesman as the play's protagonist, Willy, is on a quest for the American Dream. In 2006, Dr. Guiyou Huang from St. Thomas University in Florida wrote a paper regarding the American Dream as a recurring theme in the fiction of Asian Americans. [22] [23] Many American authors added American ideals to their work as a theme or other reoccurring idea, to get their point across. [24] There are many ideals that appear in American literature such as, but not limited to, all people are equal, United States of America is the Land of Opportunity, independence is valued, The American Dream is attainable, and everyone can succeed with hard work and determination. John Winthrop also wrote about this term called, American exceptionalism . This ideology refers to the idea that Americans are, as a nation, elect. [25] The American Dream has been credited with helping to build a cohesive American experience, but has also been blamed for inflated expectations. [27] Some commentators have noted that despite deep-seated belief in the egalitarian American Dream, the modern American wealth structure still perpetuates racial and class inequalities between generations. [28] One sociologist notes that advantage and disadvantage are not always connected to individual successes or failures, but often to prior position in a social group. [28] Since the 1920s, numerous authors, such as Sinclair Lewis in his 1922 novel Babbitt , and F. Scott Fitzgerald , in his 1925 classic, The Great Gatsby , satirized or ridiculed materialism in the chase for the American dream. For example, Jay Gatsby's death mirrors the American Dream's demise, reflecting the pessimism of modern-day Americans. [29] The American Dream is a main theme in the book by John Steinbeck , Of Mice and Men . The two friends George and Lennie dream of their own piece of land with a ranch , so they can \"live off the fatta the lan'\" and just enjoy a better life. The book later shows that not everyone can achieve the American Dream, although it is possible to achieve for a few. A lot of people follow the American Dream to achieve a greater chance of becoming rich. Some posit that the ease of achieving the American Dream changes with technological advances, availability of infrastructure and information, government regulations, state of the economy, and with the evolving cultural values of American demographics .

Furthermore, most support programs make special efforts to help minorities get ahead. [48] In a 2013 poll by YouGov , 41% of responders said it is impossible for most to achieve the American Dream, while 38% said it is still possible. [49] Most Americans perceive a college education as the ticket to the American Dream. [50] Some recent observers warn that soaring student loan debt crisis and shortages of good jobs may undermine this ticket. [51] The point was illustrated in The Fallen American Dream , [52] a documentary film that details the concept of the American Dream from its historical origins to its current perception. Research published in 2013 shows that the US provides, alongside the United Kingdom and Spain, the least economic mobility of any of 13 rich, democratic countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development . [54] [55] Prior research suggested that the United States shows roughly average levels of occupational upward mobility and shows lower rates of income mobility than comparable societies. [56] [57] Blanden et al. report, \"the idea of the US as 'the land of opportunity' persists; and clearly seems misplaced.\" [58] According to these studies, \"by international standards, the United States has an unusually low level of intergenerational mobility: our parents' income is highly predictive of our incomes as adults. Intergenerational mobility in the United States is lower than in France , Germany , Sweden , Canada , Finland , Norway and Denmark . Research in 2006 found that among high-income countries for which comparable estimates are available, only the United Kingdom had a lower rate of mobility than the United States.\" [59] Economist Isabel Sawhill concluded that \"this challenges the notion of America as the land of opportunity\". [60] [61] [62] Several public figures and commentators, from David Frum to Richard G. Wilkinson , have noted that the American dream is better realized in Denmark, which is ranked as having the highest social mobility in the OECD. [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] In the U.S., 50% of a father's income position is inherited by his son. In contrast, the amount in Norway or Canada is less than 20%. Moreover, in the U.S. 8% of children raised in the bottom 20% of the climbed to the top 20% as adult, while the figure in Denmark is nearly double at 15%. [68] [69] [70] In 2015, economist Joseph Stiglitz stated, \"Maybe we should be calling the American Dream the Scandinavian Dream.\" [71] In the United States, home ownership is sometimes used as a proxy for achieving the promised prosperity; home ownership has been a status symbol separating the middle classes from the poor . [72] Sometimes the Dream is identified with success in sports or how working class immigrants seek to join the American way of life. [73] According to a 2020 American Journal of Political Science study, Americans become less likely to believe in the attainability of the American dream as income inequality increases. [74] A 2022 study in the same journal found that exposure to \"rags-to-riches\" TV narratives makes Americans more likely to believe in upward mobility. [6] Ownby (1999) identifies four American Dreams that the new consumer culture addressed. The first was the \"Dream of Abundance\" offering a cornucopia of material goods to all Americans, making them proud to be the richest society on earth. The second was the \"Dream of a Democracy of Goods\" whereby everyone had access to the same products regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, or class, thereby challenging the aristocratic norms of the rest of the world whereby only the rich or well-connected are granted access to luxury. The \"Dream of Freedom of Choice\" with its ever-expanding variety of good allowed people to fashion their own particular lifestyle. Finally, the \"Dream of Novelty\", in which ever-changing fashions, new models, and unexpected new products broadened the consumer experience in terms of purchasing skills and awareness of the market, and challenged the conservatism of traditional society and culture, and even politics. Ownby acknowledges that the dreams of the new consumer culture radiated out from the major cities, but notes that they quickly penetrated the most rural and most isolated areas, such as rural Mississippi. With the arrival of the model T after 1910, consumers in rural America were no longer locked into local general stores with their limited merchandise and high prices in comparison to shops in towns and cities. Ownby demonstrates that poor black Mississippians shared in the new consumer culture, both inside Mississippi, and it motivated the more ambitious to move to Memphis or Chicago. [75] [76] The aspirations of the \"American Dream\" in the broad sense of upward mobility have been systematically spread to other nations since the 1890s as American missionaries and businessmen consciously sought to spread the Dream, says Rosenberg. Looking at American business, religious missionaries, philanthropies, Hollywood , labor unions and Washington agencies, she says they saw their mission not in catering to foreign elites but instead reaching the world's masses in democratic fashion. \"They linked mass production , mass marketing, and technological improvement to an enlightened democratic spirit ... In the emerging litany of the American dream what historian Daniel Boorstin later termed a 'democracy of things' would disprove both Malthus 's predictions of scarcity and Marx 's of class conflict .\" It was, she says \"a vision of global social progress\". [77] Rosenberg calls the overseas version of the American Dream \"liberal-developmentalism\" and identified five critical components: (1) belief that other nations could and should replicate America's own developmental experience; (2) faith in private free enterprise; (3) support for free or open access for trade and investment; (4) promotion of free flow of information and culture; and (5) growing acceptance of [U.S.] governmental activity to protect private enterprise and to stimulate and regulate American participation in international economic and cultural exchange. [78] Knights and McCabe argued American management gurus have taken the lead in exporting the ideas: \"By the latter half of the twentieth century they were truly global and through them the American Dream continues to be transmitted, repackaged and sold by an infantry of consultants and academics backed up by an artillery of books and videos\". [79] In West Germany after World War II , says Reiner Pommerin , \"the most intense motive was the longing for a better life, more or less identical with the American dream, which also became a German dream\". [80] Cassamagnaghi argues that to women in Italy after 1945, films and magazine stories about American life offered an \"American dream\". New York City especially represented a sort of utopia where every sort of dream and desire could become true. Italian women saw a model for their own emancipation from second class status in their patriarchal society . [81] The American dream regarding home ownership had little resonance before the 1980s. [82] In the 1980s, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher worked to create a similar dream, by selling public-housing units to their tenants. Her Conservative Party called for more home ownership: \"HOMES OF OUR OWN: To most people ownership means first and foremost a home of their own ... We should like in time to improve on existing legislation with a realistic grants scheme to assist first-time buyers of cheaper homes.\" [83] Guest calls this Thatcher's approach to the American Dream. [84] Knights and McCabe argue that, \"a reflection and reinforcement of the American Dream has been the emphasis on individualism as extolled by Margaret Thatcher and epitomized by the 'enterprise' culture.\" [85] Since the fall of communism in the Soviet Union in 1991, the American Dream has fascinated Russians . [86] The first post-Communist leader Boris Yeltsin embraced the \"American way\" and teamed up with Harvard University free market economists Jeffrey Sachs and Robert Allison to give Russia economic shock therapy in the 1990s. The newly independent Russian media idealized America and endorsed shock therapy for the economy. [87] In 2008 Russian President Dmitry Medvedev lamented the fact that 77% of Russia's 142 million people live \"cooped up\" in apartment buildings. In 2010 his administration announced a plan for widespread home ownership: \"Call it the Russian dream\", said Alexander Braverman, the Director of the Federal Fund for the Promotion of Housing Construction Development. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , worried about his nation's very low birth rate , said he hoped home ownership will inspire Russians \"to have more babies\". [88] The Chinese Dream describes a set of ideals in the People's Republic of China . It is used by journalists, government officials and activists to describe the aspiration of individual self-improvement in Chinese society. Although the phrase has been used previously by Western journalists and scholars, [89] [90] a translation of a New York Times article written by the American journalist Thomas Friedman , \"China Needs Its Own Dream\", has been credited with popularizing the concept in China. [90] He attributes the term to Peggy Liu and the environmental NGO JUCCCE's China Dream project, [91] [92] which defines the Chinese Dream as sustainable development . [92] In 2013, China's new paramount leader Xi Jinping began promoting the phrase as a slogan, leading to its widespread use in the Chinese media. [93] The concept of Chinese Dream is very similar to the idea of \"American Dream\". It stresses entrepreneurship and glorifies a generation of self-made men and women in post- reform China, such as rural immigrants who moved to the urban centers and achieve magnificent improvement in terms of their living standards, and social life. Chinese Dream can be interpreted as the collective consciousness of Chinese people during the era of social transformation and economic progress. The idea was put forward by Chinese Communist Party new General Secretary Xi Jinping on November 29, 2012. The government hoped to revitalize China, while promoting innovation and technology to boost the international prestige of China. In this light, the Chinese Dream, like American exceptionalism , is a nationalistic concept as well. According to Ellen Brown , writing in 2019, over 90% of Chinese families own their own homes, giving the country one of the highest rates of home ownership in the world . [94] Adams, James Truslow.

Through convincing logical arguments he proves that American history books are giving students across the nation false information. According to Loewen, \u201csocial class is probably the single most important variable in society.\u201d (Loewen para. 5) He goes on saying, \u201cFrom womb to tomb, it correlates with almost all social characteristics of people that we can measure.\u201d (Loewen para. 6) In addition, he establishes credibility with his audience by not accusing students or even instructors for this lack of knowledge, but clearly blames the textbooks used in high schools today. Lowen\u2019s logical approach in exposing the lies that we are taught and taught to think leave the reader with the abitlity to empathize with him, ultimately getting the message across far more effectively. Poverty, the state of being extremely poor, exists all over America! There are several different types of poverty, and the causes of poverty. Most people think of poverty as just somebody who is homeless and has no job, somebody who has no money to support the basic needs of life, and wears ragged clothing and lives under a bridge. What people don\u2019t know is there are people living in poverty that have jobs and make money but live so poorly that they are categorized with people that live in absolute poverty. Poverty is a hard concept for people to put into words. Ruby Payne states a working definition of poverty in her book A Framework for Understanding Poverty in which she says, \u201cThe extent to which an individual does without resources\u201d (7). For a better look, the dictionary defines poverty as \u201cthe state of one who lacks a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions\u201d Poverty is not having enough money to have the basic necessities in life. It is an issue within the United States and the world. There are many children that grow up in poverty and the effects can last throughout the life. When growing up in poverty there can be high- risk of teen pregnancy, poor heath, crime, Drug use and a lack of education. (Boyden) What is poverty? According to the Dictionary, \u201cPoverty is said to exist when people lack the means to satisfy their basic needs.\u201d Poverty is hunger. Poverty is lack of shelter. Poverty is being sick and not being able to see a doctor. Poverty is not having access to school and not Poverty is about not having enough money to provide basic needs of living such as food, clothing, and shelter. Poverty is not only about money it\u2019s also not having somewhere to sleep at night, being sick and not able to go to the doctor. Poverty is not able to go to school and get a proper education. Poverty is not knowing what the outcome of your future will be. Poverty and inequality are two different things, but inequality can feed widespread poverty by barring groups with lower social status from accessing the tools and resources to support themselves. What is poverty? A question most Americans will not have to think twice before answering. Poverty is, of course, simply a lack of money. The views of a specific person will defer when politics or morals are introduced, however, the idea stays the same. Those in poverty are there because they have less money than what has been decided to be livable. Poverty has changed significantly over the last two hundred years in the United States, and yet, the definition has hardly changed. As the United States of America has because a better-established country and therefore a more prosperous country, the type of people that are considered poor has changed quite a bit. Before industrialization and immigration became a bigger Poverty is the fear of not knowing where your next meal is going to come from, or where you\u2019re going to sleep at night. It\u2019s living life without basic needs such as food, clothing, and shelter. The quality of living in poverty is changing over time and so is the perception which is based solely upon the individual. Therefore, \u2018living in poverty\u201d may vary from one person to the next. However, it can be best to view poverty through the actual living conditions. What is poverty? A question most Americans will not have to think twice before answering. Poverty is, of course, simply a lack of money. The views of a specific person will defer when politics or morals are introduced, however, the idea stays the same. Those in poverty are there because they have less money than what has been decided to be livable. Poverty has changed significantly over the last two hundred years in the United States, and yet, the measurement has hardly changed since it was created fifty years ago. As the United States of America has because a better-established country and therefore a more prosperous country, the type of people that are considered poor has changed quite a bit. Before industrialization and immigration Poverty is defined as lacking in money and/or possessions. Poverty perpetuates, infests family health and well being, hinders the ability for proper nutritional growth, chips away at personal resilience, deteriorates educational systems, widens the social gaps of \u201cus\u201d versus \u201cthem\u201d feeding into stigmas. Webster\u2019s online dictionary defines poverty as \u201cthe state of one who lacks a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions (n.d.)\u201d. Hoynes, Page, and Stevens (2006) define poverty as a family\u2019s lack of pretax earned income in a given year that is below the poverty threshold for the family size. The World Bank (2000) defines poverty as the lack of material benefits considered basic necessities in society. Additionally, poverty has no proper contextual definition. The reasoning is to ask oneself whether the way poverty is defined in America is the same way in which poverty is defined in other countries. The answer would be in the negative. It has been noted in a research that the families which are classified as poor in America some of them own things such as a house, a truck, a flat screen Television, do not suffer from malnutrition etc.", "documentFile": "https://www.bartleby.com/essay/The-Land-Of-Opportunities-By-James-Truslow-FK2PW7V3RZKQ"}, {"source_title": "America still is the land of opportunity | Pat Hickey", "source_content_title": null, "source_date": "2021-08-26", "source_author": null, "documentText": ["At least in the hearts and minds of many outside of this country.", "Like the young Afghan dentist, Fada Mohammad , who fell to his death after clinging to the outside of a U.S. military plane in Kabul before extinguishing any hopes of making it to the U.S.\nOr the almost 2 million Vietnamese who risked their lives to flee oppression and hardship after the U.S. left Vietnam in 1975.", "Like we will soon see in the mountain peaks of Afghanistan, many Vietnamese couldn\u2019t make it through their perilous journey on the South China Sea.\n", "But to the thousands of \u201cboat people\u201d who did find their way to the U.S., they have settled and many have prospered.", "Like our own previous ancestors, \u201cThey\u2019ve all come to look for America,\u201d as Simon and Garfunkel sang in 1968.", "If only we would see today what America\u2019s newest ancestors come seeking for themselves.", "\nFrom the very beginning we have been a nation of immigrants.", "We would have never gotten where we have without them.", "Most came looking for the opportunity of building a new life for themselves and their families \u2014 even when there were no entitlements guaranteeing their success.", "\nIsabell Sawhill of the Brookings Institute writes in \u201cStill the Land of Opportunity?\u201d that \u201cThe American public has always cared more about equal opportunity than about equal results.", "The commitment to provide everyone with a fair chance to develop their own talents to the fullest is a central tenet of the American creed.\u201d", "\nIt\u2019s an American creed that Nevadan Hae Un Lee, the founder of Lee\u2019s Discount Liquor, believed in when he opened his first store in Las Vegas in 1981.", "Mr. Lee, who recently passed away at 79, was a former bureaucrat in South Korea who immigrated to Nevada in the hopes of starting over.", "He didn\u2019t start out driving a Bentley, but as a bus boy.", "And then a liquor salesman, where he could work even without knowing English.", "After one year, Lee bought his first liquor store, in which he slept in at nights after working 18-hour days.", "\nThe rest is history.", "Forty years later and almost 30 stores statewide are a testimony to not only the belief in the \u201cAmerican Dream,\u201d but the return on his initial sweat equity investment \u2014 a chance on a dream that resulted in not only a wildly successful enterprise, but in Mr. Lee becoming one of Southern Nevada\u2019s most generous philanthropists.", "Like many new Americans, Mr. Lee gave back in spades to a state that gambled on what may have appeared at the time to be an unlikely bet on his success.", "\nUnlikely that is for someone who didn\u2019t view himself as a victim of his circumstances, but rather those circumstances themselves as an opportunity for he and his family.", "\nJoe Kotkin is a professor of Urban Studies at Chapman University.", "He opined recently in the Daily Beast that \u201cAmerica Isn\u2019t Falling Apart.", "It\u2019s Still the Land of Opportunity.\u201d", "Kotkin observed that despite rants by then President Trump, \u201c840,000 green card holders became citizens last year, despite an endless stream of stories about what an unequal, unfair, and no good place America has supposedly become.\u201d", "\nThe Declaration of Independence\u2019s line about the \u201cpursuit of happiness\u201d may either be forgotten or seem paternalistic to many established Americans.", "Thomas Jefferson\u2019s \u201crags to riches\u201d version of the good life, and the notion of upward mobility, still seems an attainable goal for many newly minted Americans.", "\nThat\u2019s why we should remember as humorist and Oklahoma Democrat Will Rogers once admonished , \u201cAmerica is a land of opportunity and don\u2019t ever forget it.\u201d", "Mr. Lee of Las Vegas certainly didn\u2019t forget.", "Neither did two of his grandchildren;

Upon its single release, Record World called it \"an extraordinary reproduced and newly arranged version of this very funny song with a funky melody line and unique Newman vocalizing.\" [2] According to a retrospective AllMusic review by Mark Deming, the song is a \"potent mid-tempo rock tune\" and a \"witty and willfully perverse bit of erotic absurdity\". [3] Newman later admitted the song was, \"too low for me to sing it. I can't rock it too hard, which maybe I should have...or maybe not.\" [4] depending on country: \"Shelter Me\" \"Don't You Love Me Anymore\" \"Long Drag off a Cigarette\" \"Put out the Light\" (1986) (1986) (1986) Joe Cocker recorded \"You Can Leave Your Hat On\" for his 1986 album Cocker . Released as a single, Cocker's version peaked at No. 35 on Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks , [7] and it was featured in the 1986 Adrian Lyne film 9\u00bd Weeks during the striptease scene. It was also a popular single in Australia (where the film was immensely popular), reaching Number 23. A music video was released which features footage of the striptease scene from 9\u00bd Weeks and scenes with Cocker and his band performing the song. In some countries, the song itself is considered a striptease anthem, and still being used by strippers.
