"\nWidespread recognition regarding its importance to our wellbeing has led to the predictors of happiness receiving much more research attention.", "\nWhen Martin Seligman (2011b, p. 11), often

sakes: positive emotion, engagement, and meaning.\u201d", "\nBased on input from other researchers, he later replaced it with his wellbeing theory, adding two elements to arrive at the five pillars of the PERMA model : positive emotions, engagement, positive relationships, meaning, and accomplishment (Seligman, 2011b).", "\nIn Seligman\u2019s (2011a) book Authentic Happiness , he attempts to answer

Improving our happiness is important; happy people are more equipped to handle life\u2019s challenges and adopt healthy lifestyles.\nThis article introduces several key tests and scales available for scoring happiness, supporting us as we journey toward a more satisfying life.\nBefore you continue, we thought you might like to download our three Positive Psychology Exercises for free . These science-based exercises explore fundamental aspects of positive psychology including strengths, values, and self-compassion, and will give you the tools to enhance the wellbeing of your clients, students, or employees.\nThe importance of subjective wellbeing is recognized in the American Declaration of Independence\u2019s mention of the pursuit of happiness, Bhutan\u2019s Gross National Happiness Index, and the United Kingdom\u2019s life satisfaction measures (Grant, 2021; Well-being, n.d.).\nWidespread recognition regarding its importance to our wellbeing has led to the predictors of happiness receiving much more research attention.\nWhen Martin Seligman (2011b, p. 11), often referred to as the father of positive psychology, formulated his theory of authentic happiness, he believed happiness could be \u201canalyzed into three different elements that we choose for their own sakes: positive emotion, engagement, and meaning.\u201d\nBased on input from other researchers, he later replaced it with his wellbeing theory, adding two elements to arrive at the five pillars of the PERMA model : positive emotions, engagement, positive relationships, meaning, and accomplishment (Seligman, 2011b).\nIn Seligman\u2019s (2011a) book Authentic Happiness , he attempts to answer some of psychology\u2019s (and philosophy\u2019s) oldest and most challenging questions: How can we be happy? And how can we live a satisfying life?\nAs a result, he recognizes the need for measurement.\nSeligman (2019, p. 165) describes Chris Peterson in his autobiographical book The Hope Circuit , as being big \u2014 six feet and three inches tall \u2014 with a \u201ccapacious of mind and heart\u201d and a close friend and colleague instrumental to the success of positive psychology.\nPeterson worked with Seligman on several tests and inventories. These included the Attributional Style Questionnaire , which scores how we explain good and bad events, and the Values-in-Action Survey , which ranks 24 strengths and compares scores to thousands of others that have taken the test (Seligman, 2019).\nMost notably for us, he helped design the Authentic Happiness Inventory . Peterson, Seligman, and colleagues realized that \u201csatisfied individuals report higher satisfaction with life through \u2018meaning,\u2019 \u2018pleasure,\u2019 and \u2018engagement\u2019\u201d (Sigala, 2019. p. 17). Through measuring such factors, it is possible to provide a subjective assessment of happiness .\nTheir Authentic Happiness Inventory is frequently used to measure changes in happiness \u2014 or subjective wellbeing (SWB) \u2014 following positive psychology interventions and is considered highly sensitive to subtle changes (Proyer et al., 2017).\nIn the book Authentic Happiness , Seligman instructs the reader to complete the authentichappiness.org test on the internet, but this address has now been replaced by the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Authentic Happiness site, with Seligman center stage.\nThe site remains a vital repository for information on positive psychology, with links to suggested reading, courses, research opportunities, and perhaps most importantly, its measures (Authentic Happiness, n.d.).\n\u201cResearchers have theorized that there are basic and psychological needs that when fulfilled lead to SWB\u201d (Diener et al., 2018, p. 254). Needs such as growth and social interaction have been passed down as part of our evolutionary legacy, becoming universal across individuals, groups, and cultures.\nAs a result, by measuring such psychological needs, we can score an individual\u2019s happiness and compare it with others (individuals, groups, and populations). Researchers can also measure happiness or SWB at multiple points to identify changes across time.\nKnowing that such changes are possible and proven by science gives us all hope.\n\u201cPeople often think, for understandable reasons, true happiness is beyond reach for me because there is so much that I can\u2019t help that is set in stone\u201d (Waldinger & Schulz, 2023, p. 45).\nThe data tells a different story. For example, it turns out that investing in forming deep and meaningful relationships and focusing on positive emotions, such as gratitude, can boost our happiness in the short term \u2014 and across our lives (Waldinger & Schulz, 2023).\nThe Authentic Happiness Inventory is one of several found on the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s website. Once the user registers and creates a login, they select one statement in each of its 24 groups to score happiness, for example (Authentic Happiness, n.d.):\nGroup 5:\n- I rarely get what I want.\n- Sometimes I get what I want, and sometimes not.\n- Somewhat more often than not, I get what I want.\n- I usually get what I want.\n- I always get what I want.\nGroup 9:\n- By objective standards, I do poorly.\n- By objective standards, I do neither well nor poorly.\n- By objective standards, I do rather well.\n- By objective standards, I do quite well.\n- By objective standards, I do amazingly well.\nGroup 24:\n- My life is a bad one.\n- My life is an OK one.\n- My life is a good one.\n- My life is a very good one.\n- My life is a wonderful one.\nHaving completed the assessment by choosing each appropriate statement, the user is told how their scores compare to other individuals and populations.\nWhile not calculating a specific happiness score, the results indicate where their self-reported happiness sits within societal, age, gender, and occupational groups (Authentic Happiness, n.d.).\nWhile Seligman (2011a) suggests that happiness is heritable, with recent happiness genetics research indicating heritability between 30% and 40% (R\u00f8ysamb et al., 2018), it is also incredibly changeable and driven by how we live our lives and our environment. Knowing our scores can help us make the changes needed to increase our satisfaction with our lives.\nThe University of Pennsylvania offers several tests of happiness, subjective wellbeing, and life satisfaction, all of which are free to take.\nWe\u2019ve already seen the Authentic Happiness Inventory. Here are a few others.\nThe General Happiness Scale was created by Sonja Lyubomirsky (as cited in Seligman, 2011a). The individual rates each prompt or answers each question by selecting the number on a scale between one and seven that feels most appropriate.\nThere are four in total, including (Seligman, 2011a):\n- Compared to most of my peers, I consider myself \u2026\nSelect 1\u20137, where 1 is least happy and 7 is most happy.\n- Some people are generally very happy. They enjoy life regardless of what is going on, getting the most out of everything. To what extent does this characterization describe you?\nSelect 1\u20137, where 1 is not at all and 7 is a great deal.\nAll four scores are totaled and then averaged. \u201cThe mean for adult Americans is 4.8. Two-thirds of people score between 3.8 and 5.8\u201d (Seligman, 2011a, p. 46).\nThe PANAS Questionnaire involves choosing a word or phrase from a drop-down menu in response to a feeling or emotion.\nThere are 20 one-word prompts in total, such as:\nExcited\nStrong\nEnthusiastic\nJittery\nIrritable\nFor each one, the user chooses between \u201cvery slightly or not at all,\u201d \u201d a little,\u201d \u201cmoderately,\u201d \u201cquite a bit,\u201d and \u201cextremely.\u201d\nSome emotions or feelings are treated as having a positive effect (for example, excited, strong, and enthusiastic) while others have a negative effect (such as jittery and irritable). Positive and negative scores are totaled separately.\n\u201cHigh positive-affect people feel great a lot of the time; good things bring them pleasure and joy in abundance\u201d (Seligman, 2011a, p. 34). Those low in positive affect and higher in negative affect do not feel great or good often.\nThe Fordyce Emotions Questionnaire is another short test, comprising one question asking the participant to score their general level of happiness and another about the percentage of time they feel happy and unhappy (Seligman, 2011a).\nFor example:\nRate the following statement using one of 11 scores ranging from \u201cextremely happy (feeling ecstatic, joyous, fantastic!)\u201d and \u201cextremely unhappy (utterly depressed, completely down).\u201d\n- In general, how happy or unhappy do you usually feel?\nNext, score each of the following between 1% and 100%:\n- Percent of the time you feel happy on average\n- Percent of the time you feel unhappy on average\n- Percent of the time you feel neutral on average\nBased on a study including 3,050 adult Americans, the average score for the percentage of time happy is 54.13%, unhappy is 20.44%, and neutral is 25.43% (Seligman, 2011a).\nFor each test, a percentage is calculated to indicate where the participant scored in relation to those of the same gender, age group, occupation group, education level, and location.\nThere are other happiness scales and indexes not listed on the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s site. In brief, the following two scales focus on life satisfaction and therefore score our perception of our journey rather than at points (Diener et al., 2018).\nThe Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) is a way of scoring individuals\u2019 judgment on their life as a whole using five statements scored between 1 (strongly disagree) and 7 (strongly agree; Diener et al., 1985).\nIn most ways, my life is close to my ideal.\nThe conditions of my life are excellent.\nI am satisfied with my life.\nSo far, I have gotten the important things I want in life.\nIf I could live my life over, I would change almost nothing.\nThe scores measure subjective wellbeing, split between emotional and cognitive components.\nThe Students\u2019 Life Satisfaction Scale is similar to the SWLS but developed for 8- to 18-year-olds (Huebner, 1991).\nThe participants are given seven statements to rate. They are scored between 1 (strongly disagree) and 6 (strongly agree) except for two that are reverse scored.\nExamples include:\nMy life is going well.\nI have a good life.\nI would like to change many things in my life.\nI wish I had a different kind of life.\nFor more details on each one and others available, check out our 4 Scales to Measure Satisfaction With Life article.\nThe following apps are valuable downloads for your mobile device and provide practical tools for measuring happiness.\nOnce the app is downloaded, Happify scores your happiness using a questionnaire.\nBased on the results, the app suggests activities to boost your mental wellbeing , such as reducing stress, overcoming negative thoughts, and building greater resilience.

No one is. And yet, we can increase the happiness in our lives by focusing on what is important to us.\n\u201cGood relationships keep us happier, healthier, and help us live longer.\u201d\nWaldinger and Schulz, 2023, p. 278\nHappiness studies, including the multigenerational Harvard Study of Adult Development, consistently find relationships to be a crucial predictor of happiness. Make time for family, friends, and peers with whom you have close relationships (Waldinger & Schulz, 2023).\nBecoming aware of your strengths and finding opportunities to use them, especially in the workplace, is energizing, and research suggests it will improve your performance, enjoyment, and happiness (King, 2016).\nWe often dwell on what has gone wrong in our lives rather than what is working well. Reflect on all you are grateful for, forgive those against whom you have been holding a grudge, and seek out activities you enjoy.\nPositive emotions encourage other good feelings, such as joy, hope, and curiosity, and boost your capacity for satisfaction in life (Fredrickson, 2010).\nBelieving that what we are doing matters is a crucial ingredient for happiness. Identify how your job makes a positive difference in other people\u2019s lives or find opportunities to engage your passions and interests. Why not offer to help at a community project or nonprofit (King, 2016)?\nCompassion can flow in all directions simultaneously. We can experience compassion for others, others can be compassionate toward us, and we can direct compassion inward.\nBeing kinder to ourselves and those around us can help us form deeper connections and ultimately boost short- and long-term happiness (King, 2016).\nEarlier in the article, we identified several tools for measuring immediate happiness and longer-term life satisfaction. Use them to identify people, activities , and environments that make you most happy.\nSchedule enjoyable pastimes and habits into your day and take lessons learned to other areas of your life (Seligman, 2011a).\nWe have many resources available for therapists supporting individuals who wish to experience more happiness.\nOur free resources include the following:\n- Harmful to Helpful Toxic Positivity Phrases\nPhrases such as \u201cIt\u2019s all good\u201d and \u201cLook on the bright side\u201d are at best unhelpful and, at worst, toxic. This simple exercise offers replacements, such as \u201cI know that this is really hard\u201d and follow-ups, like \u201cI\u2019m here if you\u2019d like to talk.\u201d\n- Expressing Gratitude to Others\nThese seven steps can deepen relationship bonds by encouraging us to show appreciation for those special people in our lives.\nMore extensive versions of the following tools are available with a subscription to the Positive Psychology Toolkit\u00a9 , but they are described briefly below:\n- The Wheel of Life\nWe often focus too much attention in the wrong places, ignoring what is meaningful and aligned with our values. The following steps help us build a Wheel of Life to rate various domains and increase satisfaction in the most important ones:\n- Step one \u2013 Review the Wheel of Life, taking note of each area (for example, health and fitness, career and work, and family and friends).\n- Step two \u2013 Rate your degree of satisfaction for each area.\n- Step three \u2013 Connect the initial scores to create an inner wheel.\n- Step four \u2013 Reflect on and discuss which areas warrant more attention.\n- Step five \u2013 Consider what it would take to raise the satisfaction score in these areas.\n- Quality of Life Scale\nWellbeing can be thought of as our net satisfaction with our major life domains.\nIn this exercise, we score our material and physical wellbeing; relationships with other people; social, community, and civic activities; personal development; fulfillment; and recreation.\n- Step one \u2013 Review the items and score each one. For example, how important (between 1 and 7) is \u201chaving and rearing children,\u201d \u201cbeing physically fit,\u201d and \u201chaving close friends\u201d?\n- Step two \u2013 Review the scores to assess your overall quality of life based on multiple life domains .\n- Step three \u2013 If there are surprises or your quality of life is not where you would like it to be, consider what steps you could take to change things.\nIf you\u2019re looking for more science-based ways to help others enhance their wellbeing, check out this signature collection of 17 validated positive psychology tools for practitioners . Use them to help others flourish and thrive.\nHappiness comes from having a good life , though not necessarily an easy one. Scoring our subjective wellbeing helps because it allows us to understand our current degree of satisfaction and identify what we can improve to live a more fulfilling and meaningful life (Waldinger & Schulz, 2023).\nPsychologists have developed several self-report questionnaires that quantify happiness using scores attached to statements.\nThe Authentic Happiness Inventory, developed by Martin Seligman (2011a), measures subjective wellbeing based on whether we are meeting our basic psychological needs. Other measures, such as the General Happiness Scale and the Fordyce Emotions Questionnaire, are short and effective at scoring individuals\u2019 existing happiness levels.\nScales such as the Satisfaction With Life Scale offer us a picture of that person\u2019s life so far, providing insights into whether they are on the right path or should change direction.\nMeasuring happiness matters because researchers can use the results to compare an individual\u2019s happiness with other lives or, over time, their own.\nAs mental health professionals, we should find ways to help our clients form deep and meaningful relationships, experience more positive emotions, create higher engagement in their careers, and live fulfilling lives. Ultimately, we can help them live more happily according to their values.\nWe hope you enjoyed reading this article.

The individual rates each prompt or answers each question by selecting the number on a scale between one and seven that feels most appropriate. There are four in total, including (Seligman, 2011a): Compared to most of my peers, I consider myself \u2026 Select 1\u20137, where 1 is least happy and 7 is most happy. Some people are generally very happy. They enjoy life regardless of what is going on, getting the most out of everything. To what extent does this characterization describe you? Select 1\u20137, where 1 is not at all and 7 is a great deal. All four scores are totaled and then averaged. \u201cThe mean for adult Americans is 4.8. Two-thirds of people score between 3.8 and 5.8\u201d (Seligman, 2011a, p. 46). The PANAS Questionnaire involves choosing a word or phrase from a drop-down menu in response to a feeling or emotion. There are 20 one-word prompts in total, such as:  Excited  Strong Enthusiastic Jittery Irritable For each one, the user chooses between \u201cvery slightly or not at all,\u201d \u201d a little,\u201d \u201cmoderately,\u201d \u201cquite a bit,\u201d and \u201cextremely.\u201d Some emotions or feelings are treated as having a positive effect (for example, excited, strong, and enthusiastic) while others have a negative effect (such as jittery and irritable). Positive and negative scores are totaled separately. \u201cHigh positive-affect people feel great a lot of the time; good things bring them pleasure and joy in abundance\u201d (Seligman, 2011a, p. 34). Those low in positive affect and higher in negative affect do not feel great or good often. The Fordyce Emotions Questionnaire is another short test, comprising one question asking the participant to score their general level of happiness and another about the percentage of time they feel happy and unhappy (Seligman, 2011a). For example: Rate the following statement using one of 11 scores ranging from \u201cextremely happy (feeling ecstatic, joyous, fantastic!)\u201d and \u201cextremely unhappy (utterly depressed, completely down).\u201d In general, how happy or unhappy do you usually feel? Next, score each of the following between 1% and 100%: Percent of the time you feel happy on average Percent of the time you feel unhappy on average Percent of the time you feel neutral on average Based on a study including 3,050 adult Americans, the average score for the percentage of time happy is 54.13%, unhappy is 20.44%, and neutral is 25.43% (Seligman, 2011a). For each test, a percentage is calculated to indicate where the participant scored in relation to those of the same gender, age group, occupation group, education level, and location.

In brief, the following two scales focus on life satisfaction and therefore score our perception of our journey rather than at points (Diener et al., 2018). The Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) is a way of scoring individuals\u2019 judgment on their life as a whole using five statements scored between 1 (strongly disagree) and 7 (strongly agree; Diener et al., 1985).  In most ways, my life is close to my ideal.  The conditions of my life are excellent. I am satisfied with my life. So far, I have gotten the important things I want in life. If I could live my life over, I would change almost nothing. The scores measure subjective wellbeing, split between emotional and cognitive components. The Students\u2019 Life Satisfaction Scale is similar to the SWLS but developed for 8- to 18-year-olds (Huebner, 1991). The participants are given seven statements to rate. They are scored between 1 (strongly disagree) and 6 (strongly agree) except for two that are reverse scored. Examples include:  My life is going well.  I have a good life. I would like to change many things in my life. I wish I had a different kind of life.

More extensive versions of the following tools are available with a subscription to the Positive Psychology Toolkit\u00a9 , but they are described briefly below:  The Wheel of Life  We often focus too much attention in the wrong places, ignoring what is meaningful and aligned with our values. The following steps help us build a Wheel of Life to rate various domains and increase satisfaction in the most important ones: Step one \u2013 Review the Wheel of Life, taking note of each area (for example, health and fitness, career and work, and family and friends). Step two \u2013 Rate your degree of satisfaction for each area. Step three \u2013 Connect the initial scores to create an inner wheel. Step four \u2013 Reflect on and discuss which areas warrant more attention. Step five \u2013 Consider what it would take to raise the satisfaction score in these areas.

Step four \u2013 Reflect on and discuss which areas warrant more attention. Step five \u2013 Consider what it would take to raise the satisfaction score in these areas.  Quality of Life Scale  Wellbeing can be thought of as our net satisfaction with our major life domains. In this exercise, we score our material and physical wellbeing; relationships with other people; social, community, and civic activities; personal development; fulfillment; and recreation. Step one \u2013 Review the items and score each one. For example, how important (between 1 and 7) is \u201chaving and rearing children,\u201d \u201cbeing physically fit,\u201d and \u201chaving close friends\u201d? Step two \u2013 Review the scores to assess your overall quality of life based on multiple life domains . Step three \u2013 If there are surprises or your quality of life is not where you would like it to be, consider what steps you could take to change things.

Use them to help others flourish and thrive. Happiness comes from having a good life , though not necessarily an easy one. Scoring our subjective wellbeing helps because it allows us to understand our current degree of satisfaction and identify what we can improve to live a more fulfilling and meaningful life (Waldinger & Schulz, 2023). Psychologists have developed several self-report questionnaires that quantify happiness using scores attached to statements. The Authentic Happiness Inventory, developed by Martin Seligman (2011a), measures subjective wellbeing based on whether we are meeting our basic psychological needs. Other measures, such as the General Happiness Scale and the Fordyce Emotions Questionnaire, are short and effective at scoring individuals\u2019 existing happiness levels. Scales such as the Satisfaction With Life Scale offer us a picture of that person\u2019s life so far, providing insights into whether they are on the right path or should change direction. Measuring happiness matters because researchers can use the results to compare an individual\u2019s happiness with other lives or, over time, their own. As mental health professionals, we should find ways to help our clients form deep and meaningful relationships, experience more positive emotions, create higher engagement in their careers, and live fulfilling lives. Ultimately, we can help them live more happily according to their values. We hope you enjoyed reading this article. Don\u2019t forget to download our three Positive Psychology Exercises for free .

Over time, however, human rights have evolved as a term in different documents which have been written for the protection of people who are exploited, often in response to societal wrongdoings. Human rights documents have evolved to take on different needs and meanings over time, and frequently result in huge shifts in society. Nonetheless, human rights did not in fact exist until the end of the second World War, when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted. Before, documents mentioned the \u201crights of man\u201d, \u201cfreedoms\u201d or simply, \u201crights\u201d. The question is, how did human rights come to mean what they do today? Many important documents on human rights exist from different countries and cultures, but 22 will be explained in this brief history on the topic. 539 BC The Cyrus Cylinder In 539 BC, Cyrus the Great conquered the city of Babylon, freed slaves to return home, and declared that people should have a choice in their religion. This event is considered by many to be the world\u2019s first charter of human rights in history . Prior to this, people had rights based on membership to a group, such as a family for example. This event served as an inspiration to the civilizations of India, Greece, and Rome, cultures that are known these days for their contributions to rights and freedoms. 1215 The Magna Carta Undoubtedly a great first step in the long journey for human rights, a document like this would not come to be for another thousand years. Then in 1215, the Magna Carta, translated from Latin to mean \u201cThe Great Charter\u201d was issued by King John of England . This document, too, was a big step for rights because it established that the king was in fact subject to the law, despite a long history of actions without consequences. This was written a long time ago, when monarchies were commonplace, so is it still relevant? Many clauses are no longer applicable to modern times, however, the charter still holds timeless fundamental values such as the right to justice and a fair trial. 1628 The Petition of Rights Yet again, progress is made, but another 400 years goes by with little focus on establishing rights for the people. In 1628, the Petition of Right set out the rights and liberties of commoners, as opposed to the British Crown. English Parliament demanded no taxation without Parliament\u2019s consent, no imprisonment without a reason, no quartering soldiers, and no martial law in peacetime. The demands expounded upon the Magna Carta and some may sound familiar to people who are familiar with the US Bill of Rights. The next major document would not be written for another hundred years, sparked by the American Revolution. 1776 The United States Declaration of Independence In 1776, Thomas Jefferson and other prominent US political figures wrote the US Declaration of Independence, which proclaimed the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, as well as announced the colonies\u2019 separation from Great Britain. Adopted by Congress, the declaration is based on the statement \u201call men are created equal\u201d. Although not legally binding, the document would come to inspire many great future human rights documents. To think of the progress made between the Petition of Right and the US Declaration is truly astounding. The success of the Declaration of Independence led the United States of America to write a document that would eventually form a government and set laws in place, the Constitution of the United States of America. 1787 The Constitution of the United States of America The Constitution of the United States of America was written in 1787 and is the longest surviving written governmental charter in the world. It formed the fundamental law of the US federal system of government and defined the basic rights of the citizen. The authors of the Constitution outlined the 3 sectors of government: the executive, legislative, and judiciary branches. This separation of powers created a system of checks and balances that arguably prevented one branch from having too much power. With the results of the American Revolution finalized, another country with similar values, France, was inspired to have a Revolution of its own. 1789 The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen Inspired by the US Declaration of Independence and the Enlightenment, and born of the French Revolution , the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen explains a list of \u201cnatural and inalienable\u201d rights, such as security, ownership, freedom, and resistance to oppression. It echoes the importance of separation of powers set forth in the US Declaration, as well as the values of liberty, equality, and fraternity. This declaration, like others of the time, would become one of the most revered in history. 1791 The US Bill of Rights The next document to be created was so important that some delegates present at the creation of the Constitution did not in fact sign it due to its lack of this at the time: the US Bill of Rights. The bill contains the first 10 Amendments of the Constitution and limits the powers of the federal government, guarantees civil rights and liberties, and protects basic freedoms such as speech, press and religion, and the rights of all citizens, residents and visitors on US territory. Although many documents at the founding of the United States stated equality for all, it was a long time until this was an actual reality. Many would even argue that in modern times, this is still not wholly true. However, in 1863, a big step was taken towards trying to create an equal society. 1863 The Emancipation Proclamation The Emancipation Proclamation was a crucial shift in society and in views on slavery that would reshaped history. Issued by United States President Abraham Lincoln , the emancipation declared that all enslaved people \u201cshall be then, thenceforward, and forever free\u201d beginning New Years Day in 1863. However, this proclamation did not in actuality free enslaved people at the time . Rather, it changed their federal legal status. African Americans were not given the same rights as white people, yet by the end of the civil war, black men made up 10% of the Union army and were also heavily involved in other branches of the military. The fight for equality would continue for hundreds of years after the civil war, leading up until the present day and age. One year after the Emancipation Proclamation, the world\u2019s first humanitarian treaty was established. \u201cWe must not be confused about what freedom is. Basic human rights are simple and easily understood: freedom of speech and a free press; freedom of religion and worship; freedom of assembly and the right of petition; the right of men to be secure in their homes and free from unreasonable search and seizure and from arbitrary arrest and punishment\u2026 Democracy, freedom, human rights have come to have a definite meaning to the people of the world which we must not allow any nation to so change that they are made synonymous with suppression and dictatorship.\u201d Eleanor Roosevelt, The Struggle for Human Rights Speech at the United Nations 1950 The European Convention of Human Rights The European Convention of Human Rights, prompted by the UDHR, is a treaty between 47 states of the Council of Europe that is legally binding to protect basic rights and freedoms of the people. The idea for the treaty came about in the beginning of the 1940s during WWII, but only came into existence in 1950. Its official name is \u201cThe Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\u201d. It was the first instrument to give real effect to certain rights stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to ensure that governments would \u201cnever again\u201d be permitted to abuse the rights of the people. Yet, rights were still being abused and not everyone was treated equally. 1954-1968 The Civil Rights Movement One of the most powerful movements to date happened between 1954 and 1968 and the fight still continues for equality in 2021. The Modern Civil Rights Movement was a decade long movement with the goal of securing legal rights for African Americans. As a result of the passing of laws giving more rights to African Americans during Reconstruction , Jim Crow laws were established throughout the South, and other discriminatory laws were passed in the North. The Civil Rights Movement culminated with the passage of federal laws banning discrimination against African Americans in the US, including the 1957 Civil Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . Martin Luther King Jr. was a leader in the movement; he won the 1964 Nobel Prize for his work and would become one of the most well known human rights activists in history. 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination Undoubtedly in response to the Civil Rights Movement, the UN General Assembly adopted the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in 1965, but it did not become effective until 1969. The Convention is considered a generational human rights instrument that aims to eradicate racial hatred and incitement to hatred, combat prejudices which lead to racial discrimination, and guarantee the enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights without discrimination on grounds of national or ethnic origin, color, or race. As of 2018, it has 88 signatories and 179 parties. 1966 The International Bill of Rights In 1945, inspired by the French Declaration, a proposal for a \u201c Declaration of the Essential Rights of Man \u201d in an early stage was proposed, but it was not until 1966 that the proposal was completed and put into existence. The International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights together make up the International Bill of Human Rights . The bill influences the actions and decisions of State-actors, Non-State actors, and the Government. Priorities of the Bill include cultural, social, and economic rights in the creation and carry-out of international, local, and national law and policy. Three years later, the American Convention on Human Rights was adopted with similar priorities. 1969 The American Convention on Human Rights Adopted by the Organization of the American States (OAS) in 1969, also known as the Pact of San Jose, the American Convention on Human Rights became effective in 1978. This convention, along with the American Declaration on the Rights and Duties of Man , acts as a major instrument of the OAS, an organization that includes a majority of the independent states in the Western Hemisphere. The Convention focuses predominantly on an individual\u2019s political and civil rights, but also touches upon cultural, social, and economic rights. Further, it established the Inter-American Court of Human Rights . Many of the articles in the Convention are relevant to combating gender-based violence, leading to the next document. 1979 The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) Due to the name of the previous document mentioned, it is no surprise that the following document is created. What groups come to mind as being included in society? Women are not normally thought of first. The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women is the only treaty to recognize tradition and culture as molding factors of family relations and gender roles, and guarantee the reproductive rights of women. Described as an international bill of rights for women , it is an international legally binding treaty adopted by the UN General Assembly. It defines discrimination against women as, \u201c\u2026 any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field\u201d. The Convention was ratified by 189 countries and promotes equal rights for women. Surprisingly, t he USA is one of only 7 countries that has failed to ratify CEDAW. 1981 The African Charter of Human Rights As Africa contains so many countries and peoples, the establishment of the African Charter of Human Rights made important progress. It promotes and protects human rights and basic freedoms in the African continent. Along with the Charter of the Organisation of African Unity, it designates that \u201cfreedom, equality, justice and dignity are essential objectives for the achievement of the legitimate aspirations of the African peoples\u201d. Oversight and interpretation of the Charter is the task of the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights . The idea began with the Law of Lagos in the early 1960\u2019s. 1984 The Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment During the 1800s and 1900s, there were deadly Civil Wars, the First and Second World Wars, the Cold War, the Vietnam War, etc. in which torture methods were used frequently and widely. The Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment is a human rights treaty, under the review of the United Nations, that aims to prevent torture and other acts of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment around the world. Major topics of discussion included the definition of torture, universal jurisdiction, international implementation, and the undertakings of States parties. Within the previous 100 years were deadly Civil Wars, the First and Second World Wars, the Vietnam War, etc. in which torture methods were used frequently and widely. 1989 The Convention on the Rights of the Child Another group that can be often overlooked in society are minors. Many people think of children as being the property of their parents when this certainly is not the case. In 1989, the Convention of the Rights of the Child was adopted by the UN. It established the civil, political, economic, social, health and cultural rights of children, a group whose rights are largely overlooked. This treaty sets forth the idea that children are their own individuals with rights and are not in fact the property of their parents. Children must be allowed to play, develop, grow, learn, and flourish. They are, after all, the future. The Convention is the most ratified human rights treaty in history; 196 countries are party to it, including every member of the UN, except yet again, the United States. 1993 The World Conference on Human Rights Held by the United Nations in Vienna, Austria, from the 14th to 25th of June in 1993, the World Conference on Human Rights was the first human rights conference held since the end of the Cold War . The main result of the conference was the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , a plan to strengthen human rights around the world. Additionally, the conference took additional steps to promote the rights of neglected groups in society: indigenous peoples, women, and children. 2000 The Charter of the Fundamental Rights of the European Union Drafted by the European Convention and solemnly proclaimed by the European Parliament , the Council , and the Commission , the Charter of the Fundamental Rights of the European Union enshrines certain political, social, and economic rights for citizens of the European Union (EU). It is broken into 6 chapters : dignity, freedoms, equality, solidarity, citizen\u2019s rights, and justice. The Charter differs from the European Convention on Human Rights in that it was drafted by the EU and is upheld by the Court of Justice of the European Union, whereas the European Convention was drafted by the Council of Europe and is upheld by the European Court of Human Rights . 2011 UN Declaration on Human Rights Education and Training (HRET) What is most recently on the agenda in the fight for human rights? The UN Declaration on Human Rights Education and Training was established in 2011 and asserts that everyone has the right to know, seek and receive information about their human rights and fundamental freedoms. In order to promote universal respect for human rights, education and training in this area is essential. Everyone should have access to education on human rights. This is why the work of the USIDHR is so important. How to Get Involved in Human Rights Education USIDHR\u2019s goal is to achieve education for all. One way USIDHR work towards these goals is through the Edu for Every Child program, which aims to help the 258 million children out of school get the chance to go to school. Additionally, USIDHR offers courses in Human Rights Education Training , the goal of the 2011 UN Declaration. Students undertake a human rights certification program that provides all of the information needed to become a human rights consultant and make a change in the world in their own lives and the lives of others. If everyone were educated on human rights at a young age, it is likely that there would be less human rights violations across the globe.

Ideas about the inherent dignity of man originated thousands of years ago, in law and religion. It came with notions such as that one should not use arbitrary violence, lie, steal or break contracts.

From the 12th century, small parliaments were established in Scotland, Poland, the kingdom of Le\u00f3n and Paris.

Rights to protection in the field of work and unemployment arose in the 19th century under pressure from the trade union movement. A British national trade union was founded in 1830. Under pressure from within and outside of parliament, the British Empire abolished the slave trade in 1807 and slavery in 1833. Only decades later was slavery abolished in countries such as Russia (1861), the Netherlands (1863) and the United States (1865).\n- Early 20th century: Equal rights for women and men. Women\u2019s suffrage was introduced in New Zealand (1893), later in countries including The Netherlands and Russia (1917), the United States (1920) and the United Kingdom (1928).\n- Since 1948: Universal standards. From the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) has emerged an ongoing series of international human rights conventions, declarations and monitoring institutions.\nFive protagonists of individual freedom\nMany philosophers, activists, politicians and others have contributed to the development of human rights. Major breakthroughs occurred in the 18th century, during the Enlightenment. These are five individuals whose acts and writings had great influence also far beyond the borders of their native countries.\n- Voltaire (France, 1694-1778) advocated the right to choose a religion or not. From 1726 he lived alternately in exile and under a false name in France. Only at the end of his life he received great honors in France. His writings shaped the ideas of the Enlightenment, his actions on behalf of victims of religious persecution made him an example of free-minded campaigning against injustice and intolerance. The statement attributed to him, \u2018I detest your ideas but am willing to die for your right to propagate them\u2019, is actually from a biographer but accurately reflects his life and work.\n- John Locke (England, 1632-1704) got many of his ideas on rights and politics during his years of exile in the Netherlands (1683-1688). In his Two Treatises of Government (1690), he assumed a \u2018natural state\u2019 in which all people are born free and equal, and not subject to any authority. Civil society replaces that natural state. The state so becomes the result of a social contract, in which people voluntarily commit themselves to the decisions of the majority. In that society, the king has no divine right and everyone has inalienable rights to life, freedom, property and health.\n- Cesare Beccaria (Italy, 1735-1794) published On crime and punishment in 1764. The legal system must contribute to the greatest happiness of the greatest number, it should never be dependent on the arbitrary power of kings and nobility. Punishments must be humane, capital punishment and torture must be abolished. His logically constructed system makes Beccaria a founder of the rule of law.\n- Thomas Paine (1737-1809) was born in England and emigrated to America in 1774. There he published Common Sense, a call for American independence that sold a hundred thousand copies within a year. He witnessed the revolution in France, escaped the guillotine and on return to England published The Rights of Man (1791). Its principles are first, that all people are born free and have equal rights. Second, that politics must not interfere with \u2018natural\u2019 rights of people such as freedom, property, security and the right to resist oppression. And third, that state power comes from the people.\n- Mary Wollstonecraft (England, 1759-1797), who was friends with Paine, wrote the first book on how women should be fully equal to men: in their rights, their opportunities of education, their representation in politics. In her Vindication of the Rights of Women (1791), she says: \u2018Women, I acknowledge, have other duties to fulfill; but the principles to which they must be subject, so I will stubbornly maintain, must be the same.\u2019 And: \u2018I really think women should be represented [in politics]\u2019. After her premature death, the public showed more interest in her love life than in her writings. It took another hundred years for her ideas to be widely taken seriously.\nProcesses\nWhat processes have driven the historical development of human rights? One factor behind the development of human rights is the pursuit of freedom in the sense of emancipation for such groups as citizens, workers, women and slaves. There is also the pursuit of legalization, as in international laws against atrocities such as slavery, torture and imprisonment. In human rights the principle of objectivity is crucial, in that reporting should be factual and honest. The Roman historian Tacitus (1st century) already wrote that historical descriptions should be \u2018sine ira et studio\u2019 (without resentment or bias). Humaneness is a driving force behind the efforts to limit both physical and mental cruelty. Sentimentality appeals to compassion for others as human beings who have feelings just like you: slaves, the poor, the insane, criminals, women and children. Around 1750 a fiction literature arose in Europe in which empathy plays an important role for the less fortunate. In his Nobel Prize speech, Barack Obama summarized the process as \u2018the continuous expansion of moral imagination\u2019. The idea of universality emphasizes the validity of humanity, norms and moral judgments wherever and whenever. We find it already in Greek Stoa philosophy. Finally, there is the appeal to activism. Karl Marx wrote in 1845: \u2018Philosophers have only interpreted the world. The point is to change it.\u2019 In human rights, the path to that change is non-partisan and non-violent.\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights\nOnly in 1948 did a true worldwide statement come to pass: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). In essence, the text is the elaboration of an idea that has existed since time immemorial: that shared fundamental rights are needed because society cannot exist without them. A society that allows arbitrariness in the form of deception, or breach of contract, or random violence, or indiscriminate killings is a danger to itself.\nThe principles of the UDHR came from studying many sources of law of Western history, but references to a belief or tradition were left out in the final text. People with very different professional backgrounds and with different beliefs and ideologies were involved in the shaping of the declaration. That the final text includes a wide range of human rights including socio-economic rights, is due in particular to the different backgrounds of Western participants in de preparatory debates. When it came into existence, not all countries agreed with the UDHR (that is, eight countries abstained from the final vote). Yet decisions not to amend the Universal Declaration were taken by the UN member states in 1968 (Tehran) and 1993 (Vienna) without a vote against. That means that all UN member states, and not only those who agreed in 1948, have now accepted the UDHR (as does Taiwan, kicked out of the UN in 1971). Since 1948, the United Nations have adopted some 300 treaties and declarations in the field of human rights. References to the Universal Declaration are found in the constitutions of at least ninety countries.\nAren\u2019t human rights actually of a recent date?\nIn his book The Last Utopia: Human Rights in History (2010), American historian Samuel Moyn argues that only around 1968 did human rights become a concept that united humanity in its struggle for justice. In Eastern and Western Europe, as well as in the United States and Latin America, human rights crystallized within a few years as the key word in social activism, the rhetoric of international politics and the actions of the United Nations. That was in the space left by the demise of earlier political utopias, such as communism and nationalism. Moyn describes how modern human rights ideology took flight with Amnesty International, the organization that was founded in 1961 and grew into a genuine transnational movement in the 1970s. That organization rendered human rights a broadly shared commitment that is not government dependent. Amnesty was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977. That same year, U.S. President Carter made human rights the cornerstone of his foreign policy.\nThe human rights defenders of Amnesty and other organizations refer to historical sources for their work, in particular the Enlightenment. Moyn does not feel that such reference is valid: \u2018During the Enlightenment, people did not light candles to get prisoners free. They rather put the king\u2019s neck under the guillotine.\u2019 So human rights have been with us for only a few decades? In the sense of a concept that is recognized worldwide: yes. But as this article argues, ideas and practices from long ago have shaped what we now call human rights.", "source_raw_text": "The history of human rights is actually a combination of various histories.  \u25cf Human rights in philosophy: the ideas on human dignity and the rights that belong to everyone everywhere. \u25cf Human rights in law: the norms and sanctions that over the centuries have been laid down in (international) law, treaties and declarations. \u25cf Human rights in politics and campaigning: the practice of denouncing abuses of governments and calling for solidarity and action for the victims. Are human rights as old as human civilization?  Some human rights ideas are as old as civilization. From the earliest times, for example byb King Hammurabi of Babylon around 1750 BC, laws have been written (or cut in stone) that include principles of justice, fairness and protection. Such laws prescribed that:  \u25cf people must be protected by law; \u25cf a ruler is restricted by law and cannot arbitrarily deal with his subjects; \u25cf women, children, foreigners and other groups deserve special protection; \u25cf even slaves should not be mistreated; \u25cf courts must be free from corruption and arbitrariness.  These ancient laws however cannot be equated to \u2018human rights\u2019. They were not universal: they were valid for a certain state or society, not for humanity as a whole. They maintained gross inequality: there was no question that a monarch, a citizen and a slave would have the same rights. And much of what we now label human rights is not mentioned in those old laws, such as the right to freedom of opinion or the prohibition of torture.  A timeline In the history of human rights, there is no linear sequence of developments. Yet a series of phases can be distinguished. \u2018Phase\u2019 here means that certain ideas and practices had a breakthrough or blossoming in a particular historical time. Not that they were always completely new at the time \u2013 see for example the reemergence of people\u2019s representation in Medieval times. Ancient history: The inherent dignity of human beings. Ideas about the inherent dignity of man originated thousands of years ago, in law and religion. It came with notions such as that one should not use arbitrary violence, lie, steal or break contracts. Already before 200 BC. most of the world\u2019s major belief systems had been founded: the Jewish faith (later developed into Christianity), Confucianism and Daoism in China, Hinduism and Buddhism in India, and the humanistic philosophy of Athens. 3th century BC: Equality. The idea that equality of rights applies to all people is found in the Greek philosophy of the Stoics. They considered man and woman to be equal. They argued for respect for women and children, for compassion and tolerance towards the other, for inclusion of \u2018barbarians\u2019 into the human community. Some stoics considered slaves on equal footing as well. 13th century: People\u2019s representation. The practice that government owes a responsibility to representatives of the people already existed in Greek city states such as Athens, but thereafter disappeared for many centuries. From the 12th century, small parliaments were established in Scotland, Poland, the kingdom of Le\u00f3n and Paris. Most conspicuous was the English Magna Carta of 1215, a contract between the monarch and the (well-to-do) citizens who formed a \u2018parlamentium\u2019 (\u2018talkhouse\u2019). 18th century: The right to individual freedom. Some protagonists are identified in the next paragraph. This was the era in which the American Declaration of Independence (1776) and the French Declaration of Human Rights and Citizen (1789) were adopted. 19th century: Socio-economic rights and abolition of slavery. Rights to protection in the field of work and unemployment arose in the 19th century under pressure from the trade union movement. A British national trade union was founded in 1830. Under pressure from within and outside of parliament, the British Empire abolished the slave trade in 1807 and slavery in 1833. Only decades later was slavery abolished in countries such as Russia (1861), the Netherlands (1863) and the United States (1865). Early 20th century: Equal rights for women and men. Women\u2019s suffrage was introduced in New Zealand (1893), later in countries including The Netherlands and Russia (1917), the United States (1920) and the United Kingdom (1928). Since 1948: Universal standards. From the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) has emerged an ongoing series of international human rights conventions, declarations and monitoring institutions. Five protagonists of individual freedom Many philosophers, activists, politicians and others have contributed to the development of human rights.

disease dataset (Owasis et al. 2019 ).", "The dataset is then pre-processed using data cleaning and transformation techniques so that the disease symptoms in the form of feature vectors can be extracted and further diagnosed.", "\nSuppose doctors do not use AI techniques.", "In that case, it will cause a delay in treating the patients as it is tough to interpret the scanned image manually, and it also takes a considerable amount of time.", "But, on the other hand, it shows that an AI technique helps the patients and helps the doctors save the patient\u2019s life by treating them as early as possible (Luo et al. 2019 ).", "\nInvestigation 3 : What is the impact of AI in medical diagnosis?", "\nDue to advancements in computer power, learning algorithms, and the availability of massive datasets (big data) derived from medical records and wearable health monitors.", "The best part of implementing AI in healthcare is that it helps to enhance various areas, including illness detection, disease classification, decision-making processes, giving optimal treatment choices, and ultimately, helping people live longer.", "In terms of disease diagnosis, AI has been used to enhance medical diagnosis (Chen et al. 2019a , b ).", "For example, the technology, which is currently in use in China, may detect hazardous tumors and nodules in patients with lung cancer, allowing physicians to provide an early diagnosis rather than sending tissue samples to a lab for testing, allowing for earlier treatment (Keenan et al. 2020 ).", "Figure 9 illustrates the influence of artificial intelligence and other approaches.", "\nInvestigation 4 : Which AI-based algorithm is used in disease diagnosis?\nDisease detection algorithms driven by AI demonstrated to be an effective tool for identifying undiagnosed patients with under-diagnosed, uncoded, and rare diseases.", "Therefore, AI models for disease detection have an ample opportunity to drive earlier diagnosis for patients in need and guide pharmaceutical companies with highly advanced, targeted diagnostics to help these patients get correctly diagnosed and treated earlier in their disease journey (Keenan et al. 2020 ).", "The research work mentioned in the literature has covered both machine and deep learning models for diagnosing the diseases such as cancer, diabetes, chronic, heart disease, alzheimer, stroke and cerebrovascular, hypertension, skin, and liver disease.", "Machine learning models, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, Fuzzy logics, Gradient Boosting Machines, Decision Tree, K

addressed.", "\n- i.Limited Data size The most common challenge faced by most of the studies was insufficient data to train the model.", "A small sample size implies a smaller training set which does not authenticate the efficiency of the proposed approaches.", "On the other hand, good sample size can train the model better than the limited one (Rajalakshmi et al. 2018 ).", "\n- ii.", "High

dimensionality reduction techniques are available to deal with this issue (Bibault et al. 2020 ).", "\n- iii.", "Efficient feature selection technique Many studies have achieved exceptional prediction outcomes.", "However, a computationally effective feature selection method is required to eradicate the data cleaning procedures while generating high disease prediction accuracy (Koshimizu et al.

validated on a single site.", "There is a need to validate the models on multiple sites that can help improve the model\u2019s generalizability (Fukuda et al. 2019 ).", "\n- v.Clinical Implementation AI-based models have proved their dominance in medical research; still, the practical implementation of the models in the clinics is not incorporated.", "These models need to be validated in a clinical setting to assist the medical practitioner in affirming the diagnosis verdicts (Huang et al. 2020 ).", "\nInvestigation 6 : How artificial intelligence-based techniques are helping doctors in diagnosing diseases?\nAI improves the lives of patients, physicians, and hospital managers by doing activities usually performed by people but in a fraction of the time and the expense.", "For example, AI assists physicians in making suggestions by evaluating vast amounts of healthcare data such as electronic health records, symptom data, and physician reports to improve health outcomes and eventually save the patient\u2019s life (Kohlberger et al. 2019 ).", "Additionally, this data aids in the improvement and acceleration of decision-making while diagnosing and treating patients\u2019 illnesses using artificial intelligence-based approaches.", "Not only that, AI assists physicians in detecting diseases by utilizing complicated algorithms, hundreds of biomarkers, imaging findings from millions of patients, aggregated published clinical studies, and thousands of physicians\u2019 notes to improve the accuracy of diagnosis.", "\nWhen it comes to disease diagnosis, accuracy is critical for planning, effective treatment and ensuring the well-being of patients.", "AI is a vast and diverse realm of data, algorithms, analytics, deep learning, neural networks, and insights that

of different techniques with the used dataset as well as the results of an applied machine and deep learning methods in terms of multiple parameters such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, an area under the curve, and F-score has also been portrayed.", "Finally, the work that assisted researchers in determining the most effective method for detecting illnesses is finished, as in future scope.", "In a nutshell, medical experts better understand how AI may be used for illness diagnosis, leading to more appropriate proposals for the future development of AI based techniques.", "\nContrary to considerable advancements over the past several years, the area of accurate clinical diagnostics faces numerous obstacles that must be resolved and improved constantly to treat emerging illnesses and diseases effectively.", "Even healthcare professionals recognize the barriers that must be overcome before sickness may be detected in conjunction with artificial intelligence.", "Even doctors do not entirely rely on AI-based approaches at this time since they are unclear of their ability to anticipate illnesses and associated symptoms.", "Thus much work is required to train the AI-based systems so that there will be an increase in the accuracy to predict the methods for diagnosing diseases.", "Hence, in the future, AI-based research should be conducted by keeping the flaw mentioned earlier

Artificial intelligence techniques ranging from machine learning to deep learning are prevalent in healthcare for disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and patient risk identification. Numerous medical data sources are required to perfectly diagnose diseases using artificial intelligence techniques, such as ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, mammography, genomics, computed tomography scan, etc. Furthermore, artificial intelligence primarily enhanced the infirmary experience and sped up preparing patients to continue their rehabilitation at home. This article covers the comprehensive survey based on artificial intelligence techniques to diagnose numerous diseases such as Alzheimer, cancer, diabetes, chronic heart disease, tuberculosis, stroke and cerebrovascular, hypertension, skin, and liver disease. We conducted an extensive survey including the used medical imaging dataset and their feature extraction and classification process for predictions. Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines are used to select the articles published up to October 2020 on the Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, Excerpta Medical Database, and Psychology Information for early prediction of distinct kinds of diseases using artificial intelligence-based techniques. Based on the study of different articles on disease diagnosis, the results are also compared using various quality parameters such as prediction rate, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, the area under curve precision, recall, and F1-score.\nKeywords: Artificial intelligence, Alzheimer, Cancer disease, Chronic disease, Heart disease, Tuberculosis\nHealthcare is shaping up in front of our eyes with advances in digital healthcare technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), 3D printing, robotics, nanotechnology, etc. Digitized healthcare presents numerous opportunities for reducing human errors, improving clinical outcomes, tracking data over time, etc. AI methods from machine learning to deep learning assume a crucial function in numerous well-being-related domains, including improving new clinical systems, patient information and records, and treating various illnesses (Usyal et al. 2020 ; Zebene et al. 2019 ). The AI techniques are also most efficient in identifying the diagnosis of different types of diseases. The presence of computerized reasoning (AI) as a method for improved medical services offers unprecedented occasions to recuperate patient and clinical group results, decrease costs, etc. The models used are not limited to computerization, such as providing patients, \u201cfamily\u201d (Musleh et al. 2019 ; Dabowsa et al. 2017 ), and medical service experts for data creation and suggestions as well as disclosure of data for shared evaluation building. AI can also help to recognize the precise demographics or environmental areas where the frequency of illness or high-risk behaviors exists. Researchers have effectively used deep learning classifications in diagnostic approaches to computing links between the built environment and obesity frequency (Bhatt et al. 2019 ; Plawiak et al. 2018 ).\nAI algorithms must be trained on population-representative information to accomplish presentation levels essential for adaptable \u201caccomplishment\u201d. Trends, such as the charge for putting away and directing realities, information collection through electronic well-being records (Minaee et al. 2020 ; Kumar 2020 ), and exponential client state of information, have made a data-rich medical care biological system. This enlargement in health care data struggles with the lack of well-organized mechanisms for integrating and reconciling these data ahead of their current silos. However, numerous frameworks and principles facilitate summation and accomplish adequate data quantity for AI (Vasal et al. 2020 ). The challenges in the operational dynamism of AI technologies in healthcare systems are immeasurable despite the information that this is one of the most vital expansion areas in biomedical research (Kumar et al. 2020 ). The AI commune must build an integrated best practice method for execution and safeguarding by incorporating active best practices of principled inclusivity, software growth, implementation science, and individual\u2013workstation interaction. At the same time, AI applications have an enormous ability to work on patient outcomes. Simultaneously, they could make significant hazards regarding inappropriate patient risk assessment, diagnostic inaccuracy, healing recommendations, privacy breaches, and other harms (Gouda et al. 2020 ; Khan and Member 2020 ).\nResearchers have used various AI-based techniques such as machine and deep learning models to detect the diseases such as skin, liver, heart, alzhemier, etc. that need to be diagnosed early. Hence, in related work, the techniques like Boltzmann machine, K nearest neighbour (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, logistic regression, fuzzy logic, and artificial neural network to diagnose the diseases are presented along with their accuracies. For example, a research study by Dabowsa et al. ( 2017 ) used a backpropagation neural network in diagnosing skin disease to achieve the highest level of accuracy. The authors used real-world data collected from the dermatology department. Ansari et al. ( 2011 ) used a recurrent neural network (RNN) to diagnose liver disease hepatitis virus and achieved 97.59%, while a feed-forward neural network achieved 100%. Owasis et al. ( 2019 ) got 97.057 area under the curve by using residual neural network and long short-term memory to diagnose gastrointestinal disease. Khan and Member ( 2020 ) introduced a computerized arrangement framework to recover the data designs. They proposed a five-phase machine learning pipeline that further arranged each stage in various sub levels. They built a classifier framework alongside information change and highlighted choice procedures inserted inside a test and information investigation plan. Skaane et al. ( 2013 ) enquired the property of digital breast tomosynthesis on period and detected cancer in residents based screening. They did a self-determining dual analysis examination by engaging ladies of 50\u201369 years and comparing full-field digitized mammography plus data building tool with full-field digital mammography. Accumulation of the data building tool resulted in a non-significant enhancement in sensitivity by 76.2% and a significant increase by 96.4%. Tigga et al. ( 2020 ) aimed to assess the diabetic risk among the patients based on their lifestyle, daily routines, health problems, etc. They experimented on 952 collected via an offline and online questionnaire. The same was applied to the Pima Indian Diabetes database. The random forest classifier stood out to be the best algorithm. Alfian et al. ( 2018 ) presented a personalized healthcare monitoring system using Bluetooth-based sensors and real-time data processing. It gathers the user\u2019s vital signs data such as blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and blood glucose from sensor nodes to a smartphone. Katherine et al. ( 2019 ) gave an overview of the types of data encountered during the setting of chronic disease. Using various machine learning algorithms, they explained the extreme value theory to better quantify severity and risk in chronic disease. Gonsalves et al. ( 2019 ) aimed to predict coronary heart disease using historical medical data via machine learning technology. The presented work supported three supervised learning techniques named Na\u00efve Bayes, Support vector machine, and Decision tree to find the correlations in coronary heart disease, which would help improve the prediction rate. The authors worked on the South African Heart Disease dataset of 462 instances and machine learning techniques using 10-fold cross-validation. Momin et al. ( 2019 ) proposed a secure internet of things-based healthcare system utilizing a body sensor network called body sensor network care to accomplish the requirements efficiently. The sensors used analogue to digital converter, Microcontroller, cloud database, network, etc. A study by Ijaz et al. ( 2018 ) has used IoT for a healthcare monitoring system for diabetes and hypertension patients at home and used personal healthcare devices that perceive and estimate a persons\u2019 biomedical signals. The system can notify health personnel in real-time when patients experience emergencies. Shabut et al. ( 2018 ) introduced an examination to improve a smart, versatile, empowered master to play out a programmed discovery of tuberculosis. They applied administered AI method to achieve parallel grouping from eighteenth lower request shading minutes. Their test indicated a precision of 98.4%, particularly for the tuberculosis antigen explicit counteracting agent identification on the portable stage. Tran et al. ( 2019 ) provided the global trends and developments of artificial intelligence applications related to stroke and heart diseases to identify the research gaps and suggest future research directions. Matusoka et al. ( 2020 ) stated that the mindfulness, treatment, and control of hypertension are the most significant in overcoming stroke and cardiovascular infection. Rathod et al. ( 2018 ) proposed an automated image-based retrieval system for skin disease using machine learning classification. Srinivasu et al. ( 2021a , b ) proposed an effective model that can help doctors diagnose skin disease efficiently. The system combined neural networks with MobileNet V2 and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) with an accuracy rate of 85%, exceeding other state-of-the-art deep models of deep learning neural networks. This system utilized the technique to analyse, process, and relegate the image data predicted based on various features. As a result, it gave more accuracy and generated faster results as compared to the traditional methods. Uehara et al. ( 2018 ) worked at the Japanese extremely chubby patients utilizing artificial brainpower with rule extraction procedure. They had 79 Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and 23 non- Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis patients analyse d to make the desired model. They accomplished the prescient exactness by 79.2%. Ijaz et al. ( 2020 ) propose a cervical cancer prediction model for early prediction of cervical cancer using risk factors as inputs. The authors utilize several machine learning approaches and outlier detection for different pre-processing tasks. Srinivasu et al. ( 2021a , b ) used an AW-HARIS algorithm to perform automated segmentation of CT scan images to identify abnormalities in the human liver. It is observed that the proposed approach has outperformed in the majority of the cases with an accuracy of 78%.\nTo fully understand how AI assists in the diagnosis and prediction of a disease, it is essential to understand the use and applicability of diverse techniques such as SVM, KNN, Na\u00efve Bayes, Decision Tree, Ada Boost, Random Forest, K-Mean clustering, RNN, Convolutional neural networks (CNN), Deep-CNN, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), and Long short-term memory (LSTM) and many others for various disease detection system (Owasis et al. 2019 ; Nithya et al. 2020 ). We conducted an extensive survey based on the machine and deep learning models for disease diagnosis. The study covers the review of various diseases and their diagnostic methods using AI techniques. This contribution explains by addressing the four research questions: RQ1. What is the state-of-the-art research for AI in disease diagnosis? RQ2. What are the various types of diseases wherein AI is applied? RQ3. What are the emergent limitations and challenges that the literature advances for this research area? RQ4.What are the future avenues in healthcare that might benefit from the application of AI? The rest of the work is organized into various sections. Initially, a brief description of AI in healthcare and disease diagnosis using multiple machines and deep learning techniques is given in Sect. 1 . Then, it is named an introduction that includes Fig. 1 to describe all the papers taken from different organized sources for various diseases in the contribution sub-section. Materials and Methods is named as Sect. 2 , which includes the quality assessment and the investigation part regarding AI techniques and applications. Section 3 covers symptoms of diseases and challenges to diagnostics, a framework for AI in disease detection modelling, and various AI applications in healthcare. Section 4 includes the reported work of multiple diseases and the comparative analysis of different techniques with the used dataset, applied machine and deep learning methods with computed outcomes in terms of various parameters such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, the area under the curve, and F-score. In Sect. 5 , the discussion part is covered that answers the investigation part mentioned in Sect. 2 . Finally, in Sect. 6 , the work that helps researchers chooses the best approach for diagnosing the diseases is concluded along with the future scope.\nDiseases usually are quantified by signs and symptoms. A sign is identified as an objective appearance of a disease that doctors can specify, whereas a symptom is a particular indication of the patient\u2019s illness (Plawiak et al. 2018 ). Thus, every disease has various signs and symptoms, such as fever, which is found in countless conditions.\nAs shown in Fig. 1 , the number of papers reviewed under preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines for different types of diseases using AI from the year 2009 to the year 2020. The present work emphasizes various diseases and their diagnostics measures using machine and deep learning classifications. To the best of our knowledge, most of the past work focused on disease diagnostics for one or two disease prediction systems. Hence, the present study explores ten different disease symptoms and their detection using AI techniques. Furthermore, this paper is unique, as it contains an elaborate discussion about various disease diagnoses and predictions based upon the extensive survey conducted for detection methods.\nWe have directed this review according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. The survey offers the readers wide-ranging knowledge of the literature on AI (decision tree, which breaks down the dataset into smaller subsets and to build it, two types of entropy using frequencies are calculated in which X, S is a discrete random variable which occurs with probability p(i),\u2026. p(c) and logarithm with base 2 gives the unit of bits or Shannons where entropy using the frequency table of one attribute is given as (Sabottke and Spieler 2020 )\nand entropy using the frequency table of two attributes is given as\n2\nK-nearest neighbour algorithm is a supervised machine learning technique that is used to solve classification issues as well as to calculate the distance between the test data and the input to give the prediction by using Euclidean distance formula in which p, q are the two points in Euclidean n-space, and qi and pi are the Euclidean vectors starting from the origin of the space (Zaar et al. 2020 ).\n3\nWhereas regression is used to determine the relationship between independent and dependent variables. The equation Y represents it is equal to an X plus b, where Y is the dependent variable, an is the slope of the regression equation, x is the independent variable, and b is constant (Kolkur et al. 2018 )\n4\nwhere Y is the dependent variable, X is the independent variable; a is the intercept, b is the slope and is the residual error, Na\u00efve Bayes which provides a way of calculating the posterior probability, P (c | x) from P(c), P(x) and P(x | c). Na\u00efve Bayes classifier assumes that the effect of the value of an attribute (x) on a given class (c) is independent of the values of other predictors (Spann et al. 2020 )\n5\nP(c | x) is the posterior probability of class given attribute, P(x | c) is the likelihood which is the probability of the attribute given class, P(x) is the prior probability of attribute, P(c) is the prior probability of a class, k-means ( Fujita et al. 2020 ) which is used to define k centers, one for each cluster and these centres should be placed far away from each other. This algorithm also aims at minimizing an objective function which is known as squared error function, given by :\n6\n||x i -v j || is the Euclidean distance between x i -v j, Ci is the number of data points in ith cluster, C is the number of cluster center\u2019s, convolution neural network which is a type of feed-forward artificial neural network in which the connectivity pattern between its neurons is inspired by the organization of the animal visual cortex. Convolution is the first step in the process that convolution neural network undergoes (Zhang et al. 2019 )\n7\nwhere (f*g)(t) = functions that are being convoluted, t = real number variable of functions f and g, g(\n) = convolution of time function,\n= first derivative of tau function, a recurrent neural network which is used for handling sequential data and its formula in which h(t) is a function f of the previously hidden state h(t \u2212 1) and the current input x(t). The theta are the parameters of the function f is (Yang et al. 2020 )\n8\nBoltzmann machine, which optimizes the weights, a quantity related to the particular problem. Its main objective is to maximize the Consensus function (CF), which is given by the following formula (Zhou et al. 2019 )\n9\nwhere U i and U j are the set of units, w ij is the fixed weight, gradient descent which is an iterative process and is formulated by (Chang et al. 2018 )\nwhere\n1 is the next position,\n0 is the current position,\nis the small step,\nis the direction of fastest increase) in healthcare (Zhang et al. 2017 ). The extensive survey also promotes expounding prevailing knowledge gaps and subsequent identification of paths for future research (Lin et al. 2019 ). The current study reformed the structure, which produced wide-ranging article valuation standards from earlier published articles. Articles incorporated in our research are selected using keywords like \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d, \u201cDisease Detection\u201d, \u201cDisease diagnosis using machine learning\u201d, \u201cDisease diagnosis using deep learning\u201d, \u201cArtificial Intelligence in Healthcare\u201d, and combinations of these keywords. In addition, research articles associated with the applications of AI-based techniques in predicting diseases and diagnosing them are incorporated for review. Table 1 lists the publications that are included or omitted based on a variety of criteria such as time, studies to define how old papers/articles can be accessed, the problem on which the article is based, comparative analysis of the work, methods to represent the techniques used, and research design to analyse the results that are obtained. These characteristics assisted us in carrying out the research study very quickly, without wasting time on irrelevant or unnecessary searches and investigations. The standards for inclusion and exclusion are developed by the requirements of the problem of an article.\nInclusion and exclusion parameters\n|S. no.||Parameters||Inclusion standards||Exclusion standards|\n|1.||Period||Research works conducted between 2009 and 2020||Articles published before 2009|\n|2.||Investigations||Research works focusing on disease diagnosis using AI||Research works focusing other than disease diagnosis|\n|3.||Comparator||Research studies aiming to detect the disease||Research works making predictive models other than detecting diseases|\n|4.||Methodology||Research articles using ML/DL methods||Research articles using methods other than ML/DL|\n|5.||Design of Study||Original articles comprising of experimental results|\nReview articles, case studies, Patents\nLanguage other than English\nResearch articles included in this review are identified using several quality evaluation constraints. The significance of the study is assessed based on inclusion and exclusion standards. All research articles included for review encompass machine or deep learning-based prediction models for automatically detecting and diagnosing diseases. Each research work incorporated in this study carried empirical research and had experimental outcomes. The description of these research articles is stated in a separate subsection entitled literature survey.\nThe comprehensive selection of research papers is carried out in four phases: (1) identifying where records are identified through various databases. At this phase, we must do the searches we\u2019ve planned through the abstract and citation databases we\u2019ve chosen. Take note of how many results the searches returned. We can also include data found in other places, such as Google Scholar or the reference lists of related papers. Then, in one citation management application, aggregate all of the records retrieved from the searches. Keep in mind that each database has its own set of rules for searching for terms of interest and combining keywords for a more efficient search. As a result, our search technique may vary significantly depending on the database, (2) screening the selection process is done transparently by reporting on decisions made at various stages of the systematic review. One of the investigators reviews the title and abstract of each record to see if the publication provides information that might be useful or relevant to the systematic review. In certain situations, the title and abstract screening is done by two investigators. They don\u2019t split the job amongst themselves! Each investigator screens every title and abstract, and then their judgments are compared. If one of them decides to leave out an item that the other thinks should be included, they may go over the entire text together and come to a common conclusion. They can also enlist the help of a third party (usually the project manager or main investigator) to decide whether or not the study should be included. Make sure that the most acceptable justification for excluding an item is chosen. (3) Eligibility we study the complete contents of the articles that cleared the title and abstract screening to see whether they may assist in answering our research topic. Two investigators do this full-text screening. Each one examines the entire content of each article before deciding whether or not to include it. We must note the number of articles we remove and the number of articles under each cause for exclusion in the full-text screening, just as we did in the title/abstract screening. Hence, in this stage, full-text articles are assessed and then finally are included in qualitative analysis in (4) included phase by utilizing the Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) flowchart as depicted in Fig. 2 . In this stage, we\u2019ll know how many papers will be included in our systematic review after removing irrelevant studies from the full-text screen. We assess how many of these studies may be included in a quantitative synthesis, commonly known as \u201cmeta-analysis,\u201c in the fourth and final screening stage.\nPRISMA flow chart\nTo address the RQ1, RQ2, RQ3, and RQ4, the current survey examined the number of articles on different disease diagnoses using AI techniques from various data sources, including Psychological Information, Excerpta Medica Database, Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The above sources are popular sources of information for articles on AI in health informatics in previous studies. As previously explained, articles are chosen based on specified inclusion and exclusion criteria (Zhang et al. 2017 ). These were derived from (Behera et al. 2019 ), where the authors established and accepted the variations. To better understand the state of research on AI in disease detection, peer-reviewed papers are cited. The current review suggests that AI and healthcare have developed a present synergy.\nInvestigation 1: Why do we need AI?\nInvestigation 2: What is the impact of AI on medical diagnosis and treatment?\nInvestigation 3: Why is AI important, and how is it used to analyse these diseases?\nInvestigation 4: Which AI-based algorithm is used in disease diagnosis?\nInvestigation 5: What are the challenges faced by the researchers while using AI models in several disease diagnoses?\nInvestigation 6: How are AI-based techniques helping doctors in diagnosing diseases?\nDetecting any irresistible ailment is nearly an afterward movement and forestalling its spread requires ongoing data and examination. Hence, acting rapidly with accurate data tosses a significant effect on the lives of individuals around the globe socially and financially (Minaee et al. 2020 ). The best thing about applying AI in health care is to improve from gathering and processing valuable data to programming surgeon robots. This section expounds on the various techniques and applications of artificial intelligence, disease symptoms, diagnostics issues, and a framework for disease detection modelling using learning models and AI in healthcare applications (Kumar and Singla 2021 ).\nAI describes the capability of a machine to study the way a human learns, e.g., through image identification and detecting pattern in a problematic situation. AI in health care alters how information gets composed, analysed, and developed for patient care (Ali et al. 2019 ).\nSystem planning is the fundamental abstract design of the system. It includes the framework\u2019s views, the course of action of the framework, and how the framework carries on underneath clear conditions. A solid grip of the framework design can help the client realize the limits and boundaries of the said framework. Figure 3 shows a pictorial portrayal of the ailment recognition model using utilitarian machines and profound learning classification strategies. In pre-preparing, real-world information requires upkeep and pre-preparing before being taken care of by the calculation (Jo et al. 2019 ). Because of the justifiable explanation, real-world data regularly contains mistakes regarding the utilized measures yet cannot practice such blunders. Accordingly, information pre-preparing takes this crude information, cycles it, eliminates errors, and spares it an extra examination. Information experiences a progression of steps during pre-handling (Chen et al. 2019a , b ): Information is purged by various strategies in information cleaning. These strategies involve gathering information, such as filling the information spaces that are left clear or decreasing information, such as the disposal of commas or other obscure characters. In information osmosis, the information is joined from a combination of sources. The information is then amended for any blend of mistakes, and they are quickly taken care of. Information Alteration : Data in this progression is standardized, which depends upon the given calculation. Information standardization can be executed utilizing several ways (Nasser et al. 2019 ). This progression is obligatory in most information mining calculations, as the information wants to be as perfect as possible. Information is then mutual and developed. Information Lessening : This progression in the strategy centers to diminish the information to more helpful levels. Informational collection and test information : The informational collection is segregated into parts preparing and testing informational indexes. The preparation information is utilized to gauge the actual examples of the data (Sarao et al. 2020 ). Equivalent to information needed for preparing and testing, experimental data is often replicated from a similar informational index. After the model has been pre-handled, the jiffy step is to test the accuracy of the framework. Systematic model : Analytical displaying strategies are utilized to calculate the probability of a given occurrence function given commitment factors, and it is very productive in illness expectation. It tends to imagine what the individual is experiencing in light of their info indications and prior determinations (Keenan et al. 2020 ; Rajalakshmi et al. 2018 ).\nClinical Imaging is seen to assign the arrangement of procedures that produce pictures of the inside part of the body.

The authors used 800 chest X-ray images taken from two public datasets named Montgomery and Shenzhen. L\u00f3pez-\u00dabeda et al. ( 2020 ) explored the machine learning methods to detect tuberculosis in Spanish radiology reports. They also mentioned the deep learning classification algorithms with the purpose of its evaluation and comparison and to carry such a task. The authors have used the data of 5947 radiology reports collected from high-tech media. Ullah et al. ( 2020 ) presented the study of Raman Spectroscopy and machine learning based on principal component analysis and hierarchical component analysis to analyse tuberculosis either in positive form or negative form. They also showed Raman results which indicated the irregularities in the blood composition collected from tuberculosis-negative patients. Panicker et al. ( 2018 ) introduced the programmed technique for the location of tuberculosis bacilli from tiny smear pictures. They performed picture binarization and grouping of distinguished districts utilizing convolution neural organization. They did an assessment utilizing 22 sputum smear minuscule pictures. The results demonstrated 97.13% review, 78.4% accuracy, 86.76% F-score for predicting tuberculosis. Lai et al. ( 2020 ) compared the artificial neural network outcomes, support vector machine, and random forest while diagnosing anti-tuberculosis drugs on Taipei Medical University Wanfang Hospital patients. They selected the features via univariate risk factor analysis and literature evaluation. The authors achieved the specificity by 90.4% and sensitivity of 80%. Gao et al. ( 2019 ) investigated the applications of computed topography pulmonary images to detect tuberculosis at five levels of severity. They proposed a deep Res Net to predict the severity scores and analyse the high severity probability. They also calculate overall severity probability, separate probabilities of both high severity and low severity forces. Singh et al. ( 2020 ) worked to discover tuberculosis sores in the lungs. They proposed a computerized recognition strategy utilizing a profound learning technique known as Antialiased Convolution Neural Network proposed by Richard Zhang. Their dataset included 3D computed topography pictures, which were cut into 2D pictures. They applied division on each cutting picture utilizing UNet and Link net design.\nAI can analyse and detect stroke signs in medical images as if the system suspects a stroke in the patient. It immediately gives the signal to the patient or doctor. Researchers have proposed various methodologies to showcase the impact of AI in stroke and cerebrovascular detection (Singh et al. 2009 ). O\u2019Connell et al. ( 2017 ) assessed the diagnostic capability and temporal stability for the detection of stroke. They observed the mostly identical patterns between the stroke patients and controls across the ten patients. They achieved the specificity and sensitivity of 90% across the research. Labovitz et al. ( 2017 ) stated the use of AI for daily monitoring of patients for the identification and medication. They achieved the improvement by 50%on plasma drug concentration levels. Abedi et al.

( 2009 ) compared the different methods to predict stroke on the cardiovascular health study dataset. They also used the decision tree algorithm for the feature selection process, principal component analysis to reduce the classification algorithm\u2019s dimension, and a backpropagation neural network. Biswas et al. ( 2020 ) introduced an AI-based system for the location and estimation of carotid plaque as carotid intima-media thickness for the same and solid atherosclerotic carotid divider discovery and plaque estimations.\nResearchers have found that AI has been able to diagnose hypertension by taking input data from blood pressure, demographics, etc. Krittanawong et al. ( 2018 ) summarized the review about the recent computer science and medical field advancements. They also illustrated the innovative approach of artificial intelligence to predict the early stages of hypertension. They also stated that AI plays a vital role in investigating the risk factors for hypertension. However, on the side, it has also been restricted by researchers because of its limitations in designing, etc. Arsalan et al. ( 2019 ) conducted the experiments using three publicly available datasets as digitized retinal imagery for vessel extraction (DRIVE), structured analysis of retina (STARE) for hypertension detection. They achieved the accuracy for all datasets with sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve, and accuracy of 80.22%, 98.1%, 98.2%, 96.55%, respectively. Kanegae et al. ( 2020 ) used machine learning techniques to validate the prediction of risk for new-onset hypertension. They used data in a split form for the model construction and development and validation to test its performance. The models they used were XGBoost and ensemble, in which the XGBoost model was considered the best predictor because it was systolic blood pressure nature during cardio ankle vascular. Figure 7 shows the structure of heart during its normal phase as well as in hypertension phase. When the human heart is in hypertension phase, its pulmonary arteries gets constricted because of which the right ventricle did not get the blood in to the lungs.\nPulmonary hypertension (Kanegae et al. 2020 )\nKoshimizu et al. ( 2020 ) has also described artificial intelligence in pulse the executives, which was utilized to foresee the chance of circulatory strain utilizing enormous scope information. The authors also focused on the measure that was used to control blood pressure using an artificial neural network. In a nutshell, they were trying to prove that an artificial neural network is beneficial for high blood pressure organization and can also use it to create medical confirmation for the realistic organization of hypertension. Mueller et al. ( 2020 ) stated that using artificial analytic tools to the large dataset based on hypertension would generate questionable results and would also miss treatments and the potential targets. The author also stated that the vision of hypertension would be challenging to achieve and doubtlessly not happen in the future. Chaikijuraja et al. ( 2020 ) also noted the merits of using artificial intelligence to detect hypertension as artificial intelligence can recognize hypertension\u2019s risk factors and phenotypes.\nMoreover, it is used to interpret data from randomized trials that contained blood pressure targets associated with cardio vascular outcomes. Kiely et al. ( 2019 ) investigated the prescient model dependent on the medical care assets that could be sued to screen huge populaces to distinguish the patients at great danger of pneumonic blood vessel hypertension. They took the information of 709 patients from 2008 to 2016 with pneumonic blood vessel hypertension and contrasted it and separated associate of 2,812,458 who was delegated non-aspiratory blood vessel hypertension just as the prescient model was created and approved by utilizing cross approval. Kwon et al.

Thus, AI provides insights for hypertension healthcare and implements prescient, customized, and pre-emptive methodologies in clinical practice.\nResearchers have developed an AI system that can precisely group cutaneous skin problems and fill in as an auxiliary instrument to improve the demonstrative exactness of clinicians. Chakraborty et al. ( 2017 ) proposed a neural-based location technique for various skin disorders. They utilized two infected skin pictures named Basel Cell Carcinoma and Skin Angioma. Non-overwhelming arranging hereditary calculation is used to prepare the counterfeit neural organization, contrasted with the neural network particle swarm optimization classifier and neural network Caesarean Section classifier. Zaar et al. ( 2020 ) collected the clinical images of skin disease from the department of Dermatology at the Sahlgrenska University, where artificial intelligence algorithms had been used for the classification, thereby achieving the diagnosis accuracy by 56.4% for the top five suggested diseases. Kumar et al. ( 2019 ) used a dual-stage approach that combined computer vision and machine learning to evaluate and recognize skin diseases. During training and testing of the diseases, the method produced an accuracy of up to 95%. Kolkur et al. ( 2018 ) developed a system that identified skin disease based on input symptoms. They collected the data of the symptoms of ten skin diseases and got 90% above accuracy.\nResearchers have found that AI can treat liver disease at its early diagnosis to work on its endurance and heal rate. Abdar et al. ( 2018 ) showed that efficient early liver disease recognition through Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network calculation depends on different choice tree calculations, such as chi-square programmed communication indicator and characterization, and relapse tree with boosting strategy. Their technique had the option to analyse and characterize the liver malady proficiently. Khaled et al. ( 2018 ) introduced an artificial neural network for the diagnosis of hepatitis virus. Protein and Histology is utilized as an info variable for the fake neural organization model, and it also showed the correct prediction of diagnosis by 93%. Spann et al. ( 2020 ) provided the strengths of machine learning tools and their potential as machine learning is applied to liver disease research, including clinical, molecular, demographic, pathological, and radiological data. Nahar and Ara ( 2018 ) explored the early guess of liver ailment using various decision tree techniques. The choice tree methods utilized were J48, Licensed Massage Therapist, Random Forest, Random Tree, REP tree, Decision Stump, and Hoeffding Trees. Their primary purpose was to calculate and compare the performances of various decision tree techniques. Farokhzad et al. ( 2016 ) used fuzzy logic for diagnosing liver sickness. Using this method, where they had two triangular membership and Gussy membership functions, they reached 79\u201383% accuracy.\nIn addition to the above mentioned reported work, the comparative analysis illustrated in Table 4 showcase the detailed information such as type of dataset, techniques, and the predicted outcomes regarding the work done by the researchers on different diseases, which in return helped the author to look for the best technique for detecting or diagnosing any particular disease.\nComparative analysis for different disease detection\n|Authors||Type of disease||Dataset||Technique||Reported outcomes|\n|Naseer et al.

AI uses machine and deep learning models that work upon training and testing data sets so that the system can see the disease and diagnose it early. In the AI-based model, we initially need to train human beings to remember the data and provide accurate results. However, it also deals with the problem. Suppose the training data produced the incorrect analysis of disease because of insufficient information, which artificial intelligence cannot factor. As a result, it will become a horrible condition for the patients as AI cannot assure us whether the prediction regarding disease detection is accurate.\nOn assaying the accuracy of algorithms in diagnosing the disease, deep learning classifiers have dominated over machine learning models in the field of disease diagnosis. Deep learning models have proved to be best in terms of scalp disease by 99%, Alzheimer disease by 96%, thyroid disease by 99%, 96% in skin disease, 99.37% in case of Arrhythmia disease, 95.7% in diabetic disease, while as machine learning models achieved 89% in diabetic disease, 88.67% in tuberculosis, 86.84% in Alzheimer disease, etc.\nWe have presented recently published research studies that employed AI-based Learning techniques for diagnosing the disease in the current review. This study highlights research on disease diagnosis prediction and predicting the post-operative life expectancy of diseased patients using AI-based learning techniques.\nInvestigation 1 : Why do we need AI?\nWe know that AI is the simulation of human processes by machines (computer systems) and that this simulation includes learning, reasoning, and self-correction. We require AI since the amount of labour we must perform is rising daily. As a result, it\u2019s a good idea to automate regular tasks. It conserves the organization\u2019s staff and also boosts production (Vasal et al. 2020 ).\nIn terms of the healthcare industry, AI in health refers to a set of diverse technologies that enable robots to detect, comprehend, act, and learn1 to execute administrative and clinical healthcare activities. AI has the potential to transform healthcare by addressing some of the industry\u2019s most pressing issues. For example, AI can result in improved patient outcomes and increased productivity and efficiency in care delivery (Gouda et al. 2020 ). It can also enhance healthcare practitioners\u2019 daily lives by spending more time caring for patients, therefore increasing staff morale and retention. In addition, it may potentially help bring life-saving medicines to market more quickly. Figure 8 shows the significance of AI in the medical field.\nInvestigation 2 : Why is AI important, and how is it used to analyse the disease?\nThe emergence of new diseases remains a critical parameter in human health and society. Hence, the advances in AI allow for rapid processing and analysis of such massive and complex data. It recommends the correct decision for over ten different diseases (as mentioned in the literature) with at least 98% accuracy.\nDoctors use technologies such as computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging to produce a detailed 3D map of the area that needs to be diagnosed. Later, AI technology analyse s the system-generated image using machine and deep learning models to spot the diseased area\u2019s features in seconds. As shown in the framework section, an artificial intelligence model using machine and deep learning algorithms is initially trained with the help of a particular disease dataset (Owasis et al. 2019 ). The dataset is then pre-processed using data cleaning and transformation techniques so that the disease symptoms in the form of feature vectors can be extracted and further diagnosed.\nSuppose doctors do not use AI techniques. In that case, it will cause a delay in treating the patients as it is tough to interpret the scanned image manually, and it also takes a considerable amount of time. But, on the other hand, it shows that an AI technique helps the patients and helps the doctors save the patient\u2019s life by treating them as early as possible (Luo et al. 2019 ).\nInvestigation 3 : What is the impact of AI in medical diagnosis?\nDue to advancements in computer power, learning algorithms, and the availability of massive datasets (big data) derived from medical records and wearable health monitors. The best part of implementing AI in healthcare is that it helps to enhance various areas, including illness detection, disease classification, decision-making processes, giving optimal treatment choices, and ultimately, helping people live longer. In terms of disease diagnosis, AI has been used to enhance medical diagnosis (Chen et al. 2019a , b ). For example, the technology, which is currently in use in China, may detect hazardous tumors and nodules in patients with lung cancer, allowing physicians to provide an early diagnosis rather than sending tissue samples to a lab for testing, allowing for earlier treatment (Keenan et al. 2020 ). Figure 9 illustrates the influence of artificial intelligence and other approaches.\nInvestigation 4 : Which AI-based algorithm is used in disease diagnosis?\nDisease detection algorithms driven by AI demonstrated to be an effective tool for identifying undiagnosed patients with under-diagnosed, uncoded, and rare diseases. Therefore, AI models for disease detection have an ample opportunity to drive earlier diagnosis for patients in need and guide pharmaceutical companies with highly advanced, targeted diagnostics to help these patients get correctly diagnosed and treated earlier in their disease journey (Keenan et al. 2020 ). The research work mentioned in the literature has covered both machine and deep learning models for diagnosing the diseases such as cancer, diabetes, chronic, heart disease, alzheimer, stroke and cerebrovascular, hypertension, skin, and liver disease. Machine learning models, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, Fuzzy logics, Gradient Boosting Machines, Decision Tree, K nearest neighbour (KNN), and Support vector machines (SVM) are primarily used in literature. Among deep learning models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been used most commonly for disease diagnosis. In addition, faster Recurrent Convolution Neural Network, Multilayer Perceptron, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) have also been used extensively in the literature. Figure 10 displays the usage of AI-based prediction models in the literature.\nArtificial intelligence-based prediction models\nInvestigation 5 : What are the challenges faced by the researchers while using AI models in several disease diagnosis?\nAlthough AI-based techniques have marked their significance in disease diagnosis, there are still many challenges faced by the researchers that need to be addressed.\n- i.Limited Data size The most common challenge faced by most of the studies was insufficient data to train the model. A small sample size implies a smaller training set which does not authenticate the efficiency of the proposed approaches. On the other hand, good sample size can train the model better than the limited one (Rajalakshmi et al. 2018 ).\n- ii.High dimensionality Another data-related issue faced in cancer research is high dimensionality. High dimensionality is referred to a vast number of features as compared to cases. However, multiple dimensionality reduction techniques are available to deal with this issue (Bibault et al. 2020 ).\n- iii.Efficient feature selection technique Many studies have achieved exceptional prediction outcomes. However, a computationally effective feature selection method is required to eradicate the data cleaning procedures while generating high disease prediction accuracy (Koshimizu et al. 2020 ).\n- iv.Model Generalizability A shift in research towards improving the generalizability of the model is required. Most of the studies have proposed a prediction model that is validated on a single site. There is a need to validate the models on multiple sites that can help improve the model\u2019s generalizability (Fukuda et al. 2019 ).\n- v.Clinical Implementation AI-based models have proved their dominance in medical research; still, the practical implementation of the models in the clinics is not incorporated. These models need to be validated in a clinical setting to assist the medical practitioner in affirming the diagnosis verdicts (Huang et al. 2020 ).\nInvestigation 6 : How artificial intelligence-based techniques are helping doctors in diagnosing diseases?\nAI improves the lives of patients, physicians, and hospital managers by doing activities usually performed by people but in a fraction of the time and the expense. For example, AI assists physicians in making suggestions by evaluating vast amounts of healthcare data such as electronic health records, symptom data, and physician reports to improve health outcomes and eventually save the patient\u2019s life (Kohlberger et al. 2019 ). Additionally, this data aids in the improvement and acceleration of decision-making while diagnosing and treating patients\u2019 illnesses using artificial intelligence-based approaches. Not only that, AI assists physicians in detecting diseases by utilizing complicated algorithms, hundreds of biomarkers, imaging findings from millions of patients, aggregated published clinical studies, and thousands of physicians\u2019 notes to improve the accuracy of diagnosis.\nWhen it comes to disease diagnosis, accuracy is critical for planning, effective treatment and ensuring the well-being of patients. AI is a vast and diverse realm of data, algorithms, analytics, deep learning, neural networks, and insights that is constantly expanding and adapting to the needs of the healthcare industry and its patients. According to the findings of this study, AI approaches in the healthcare system, particularly for illness detection, are essential. Aiming at illuminating how machine and deep learning techniques work in various disease diagnosis areas, the current study has been divided into several sections that cover the diagnosis of alzheimer\u2019s, cancer, diabetes, chronic diseases, heart disease, stroke and cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, skin disease, and liver disease. The introduction and contribution were covered in the first section, followed by an evaluation of the quality of the work and an examination of AI approaches and applications. Later, various illness symptoms and diagnostic difficulties, a paradigm for AI in disease detection models, and various AI applications in healthcare were discussed. The reported work on multiple diseases and the comparative analysis of different techniques with the used dataset as well as the results of an applied machine and deep learning methods in terms of multiple parameters such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, an area under the curve, and F-score has also been portrayed. Finally, the work that assisted researchers in determining the most effective method for detecting illnesses is finished, as in future scope. In a nutshell, medical experts better understand how AI may be used for illness diagnosis, leading to more appropriate proposals for the future development of AI based techniques.\nContrary to considerable advancements over the past several years, the area of accurate clinical diagnostics faces numerous obstacles that must be resolved and improved constantly to treat emerging illnesses and diseases effectively. Even healthcare professionals recognize the barriers that must be overcome before sickness may be detected in conjunction with artificial intelligence. Even doctors do not entirely rely on AI-based approaches at this time since they are unclear of their ability to anticipate illnesses and associated symptoms. Thus much work is required to train the AI-based systems so that there will be an increase in the accuracy to predict the methods for diagnosing diseases. Hence, in the future, AI-based research should be conducted by keeping the flaw mentioned earlier in consideration to provide a mutually beneficial relationship between AI and clinicians. In addition to this, a decentralized federated learning model should also be applied to create a single training model for disease datasets at remote places for the early diagnosis of diseases.\nThis research work was supported by Sejong University research fund.

Artificial intelligence techniques ranging from machine learning to deep learning are prevalent in healthcare for disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and patient risk identification. Numerous medical data sources are required to perfectly diagnose diseases using artificial intelligence techniques, such as ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, mammography, genomics, computed tomography scan, etc. Furthermore, artificial intelligence primarily enhanced the infirmary experience and sped up preparing patients to continue their rehabilitation at home. This article covers the comprehensive survey based on artificial intelligence techniques to diagnose numerous diseases such as Alzheimer, cancer, diabetes, chronic heart disease, tuberculosis, stroke and cerebrovascular, hypertension, skin, and liver disease. We conducted an extensive survey including the used medical imaging dataset and their feature extraction and classification process for predictions. Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines are used to select the articles published up to October 2020 on the Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, Excerpta Medical Database, and Psychology Information for early prediction of distinct kinds of diseases using artificial intelligence-based techniques. Based on the study of different articles on disease diagnosis, the results are also compared using various quality parameters such as prediction rate, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, the area under curve precision, recall, and F1-score. Keywords: Artificial intelligence, Alzheimer, Cancer disease, Chronic disease, Heart disease, Tuberculosis Healthcare is shaping up in front of our eyes with advances in digital healthcare technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), 3D printing, robotics, nanotechnology, etc. Digitized healthcare presents numerous opportunities for reducing human errors, improving clinical outcomes, tracking data over time, etc. AI methods from machine learning to deep learning assume a crucial function in numerous well-being-related domains, including improving new clinical systems, patient information and records, and treating various illnesses (Usyal et al. 2020 ; Zebene et al. 2019 ). The AI techniques are also most efficient in identifying the diagnosis of different types of diseases. The presence of computerized reasoning (AI) as a method for improved medical services offers unprecedented occasions to recuperate patient and clinical group results, decrease costs, etc. The models used are not limited to computerization, such as providing patients, \u201cfamily\u201d (Musleh et al. 2019 ; Dabowsa et al. 2017 ), and medical service experts for data creation and suggestions as well as disclosure of data for shared evaluation building. AI can also help to recognize the precise demographics or environmental areas where the frequency of illness or high-risk behaviors exists. Researchers have effectively used deep learning classifications in diagnostic approaches to computing links between the built environment and obesity frequency (Bhatt et al. 2019 ; Plawiak et al. 2018 ). AI algorithms must be trained on population-representative information to accomplish presentation levels essential for adaptable \u201caccomplishment\u201d. Trends, such as the charge for putting away and directing realities, information collection through electronic well-being records (Minaee et al. 2020 ; Kumar 2020 ), and exponential client state of information, have made a data-rich medical care biological system. This enlargement in health care data struggles with the lack of well-organized mechanisms for integrating and reconciling these data ahead of their current silos. However, numerous frameworks and principles facilitate summation and accomplish adequate data quantity for AI (Vasal et al. 2020 ). The challenges in the operational dynamism of AI technologies in healthcare systems are immeasurable despite the information that this is one of the most vital expansion areas in biomedical research (Kumar et al. 2020 ). The AI commune must build an integrated best practice method for execution and safeguarding by incorporating active best practices of principled inclusivity, software growth, implementation science, and individual\u2013workstation interaction. At the same time, AI applications have an enormous ability to work on patient outcomes. Simultaneously, they could make significant hazards regarding inappropriate patient risk assessment, diagnostic inaccuracy, healing recommen\u00addations, privacy breaches, and other harms (Gouda et al. 2020 ; Khan and Member 2020 ). Researchers have used various AI-based techniques such as machine and deep learning models to detect the diseases such as skin, liver, heart, alzhemier, etc. that need to be diagnosed early. Hence, in related work, the techniques like Boltzmann machine, K nearest neighbour (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, logistic regression, fuzzy logic, and artificial neural network to diagnose the diseases are presented along with their accuracies. For example, a research study by Dabowsa et al. ( 2017 ) used a backpropagation neural network in diagnosing skin disease to achieve the highest level of accuracy. The authors used real-world data collected from the dermatology department. Ansari et al. ( 2011 ) used a recurrent neural network (RNN) to diagnose liver disease hepatitis virus and achieved 97.59%, while a feed-forward neural network achieved 100%. Owasis et al.

Accumulation of the data building tool resulted in a non-significant enhancement in sensitivity by 76.2% and a significant increase by 96.4%. Tigga et al. ( 2020 ) aimed to assess the diabetic risk among the patients based on their lifestyle, daily routines, health problems, etc. They experimented on 952 collected via an offline and online questionnaire. The same was applied to the Pima Indian Diabetes database. The random forest classifier stood out to be the best algorithm. Alfian et al. ( 2018 ) presented a personalized healthcare monitoring system using Bluetooth-based sensors and real-time data processing. It gathers the user\u2019s vital signs data such as blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and blood glucose from sensor nodes to a smartphone. Katherine et al. ( 2019 ) gave an overview of the types of data encountered during the setting of chronic disease. Using various machine learning algorithms, they explained the extreme value theory to better quantify severity and risk in chronic disease. Gonsalves et al. ( 2019 ) aimed to predict coronary heart disease using historical medical data via machine learning technology. The presented work supported three supervised learning techniques named Na\u00efve Bayes, Support vector machine, and Decision tree to find the correlations in coronary heart disease, which would help improve the prediction rate. The authors worked on the South African Heart Disease dataset of 462 instances and machine learning techniques using 10-fold cross-validation. Momin et al. ( 2019 ) proposed a secure internet of things-based healthcare system utilizing a body sensor network called body sensor network care to accomplish the requirements efficiently. The sensors used analogue to digital converter, Microcontroller, cloud database, network, etc. A study by Ijaz et al. ( 2018 ) has used IoT for a healthcare monitoring system for diabetes and hypertension patients at home and used personal healthcare devices that perceive and estimate a persons\u2019 biomedical signals. The system can notify health personnel in real-time when patients experience emergencies. Shabut et al. ( 2018 ) introduced an examination to improve a smart, versatile, empowered master to play out a programmed discovery of tuberculosis.

It is observed that the proposed approach has outperformed in the majority of the cases with an accuracy of 78%. To fully understand how AI assists in the diagnosis and prediction of a disease, it is essential to understand the use and applicability of diverse techniques such as SVM, KNN, Na\u00efve Bayes, Decision Tree, Ada Boost, Random Forest, K-Mean clustering, RNN, Convolutional neural networks (CNN), Deep-CNN, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), and Long short-term memory (LSTM) and many others for various disease detection system (Owasis et al. 2019 ; Nithya et al. 2020 ). We conducted an extensive survey based on the machine and deep learning models for disease diagnosis. The study covers the review of various diseases and their diagnostic methods using AI techniques. This contribution explains by addressing the four research questions: RQ1. What is the state-of-the-art research for AI in disease diagnosis? RQ2. What are the various types of diseases wherein AI is applied? RQ3. What are the emergent limitations and challenges that the literature advances for this research area? RQ4.What are the future avenues in healthcare that might benefit from the application of AI? The rest of the work is organized into various sections. Initially, a brief description of AI in healthcare and disease diagnosis using multiple machines and deep learning techniques is given in Sect. 1 . Then, it is named an introduction that includes Fig. 1 to describe all the papers taken from different organized sources for various diseases in the contribution sub-section. Materials and Methods is named as Sect. 2 , which includes the quality assessment and the investigation part regarding AI techniques and applications. Section 3 covers symptoms of diseases and challenges to diagnostics, a framework for AI in disease detection modelling, and various AI applications in healthcare. Section 4 includes the reported work of multiple diseases and the comparative analysis of different techniques with the used dataset, applied machine and deep learning methods with computed outcomes in terms of various parameters such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, the area under the curve, and F-score. In Sect. 5 , the discussion part is covered that answers the investigation part mentioned in Sect. 2 . Finally, in Sect. 6 , the work that helps researchers chooses the best approach for diagnosing the diseases is concluded along with the future scope. Diseases usually are quantified by signs and symptoms. A sign is identified as an objective appearance of a disease that doctors can specify, whereas a symptom is a particular indication of the patient\u2019s illness (Plawiak et al. 2018 ). Thus, every disease has various signs and symptoms, such as fever, which is found in countless conditions. As shown in Fig. 1 , the number of papers reviewed under preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines for different types of diseases using AI from the year 2009 to the year 2020. The present work emphasizes various diseases and their diagnostics measures using machine and deep learning classifications. To the best of our knowledge, most of the past work focused on disease diagnostics for one or two disease prediction systems. Hence, the present study explores ten different disease symptoms and their detection using AI techniques. Furthermore, this paper is unique, as it contains an elaborate discussion about various disease diagnoses and predictions based upon the extensive survey conducted for detection methods. We have directed this review according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. The survey offers the readers wide-ranging knowledge of the literature on AI (decision tree, which breaks down the dataset into smaller subsets and to build it, two types of entropy using frequencies are calculated in which X, S is a discrete random variable which occurs with probability p(i),\u2026. p(c) and logarithm with base 2 gives the unit of bits or Shannons where entropy using the frequency table of one attribute is given as (Sabottke and Spieler 2020 ) and entropy using the frequency table of two attributes is given as 2 K-nearest neighbour algorithm is a supervised machine learning technique that is used to solve classification issues as well as to calculate the distance between the test data and the input to give the prediction by using Euclidean distance formula in which p, q are the two points in Euclidean n-space, and qi and pi are the Euclidean vectors starting from the origin of the space (Zaar et al. 2020 ). 3 Whereas regression is used to determine the relationship between independent and dependent variables. The equation Y represents it is equal to an X plus b, where Y is the dependent variable, an is the slope of the regression equation, x is the independent variable, and b is constant (Kolkur et al. 2018 ) 4 where Y is the dependent variable, X is the independent variable; a is the intercept, b is the slope and is the residual error, Na\u00efve Bayes which provides a way of calculating the posterior probability, P (c | x) from P(c), P(x) and P(x | c). Na\u00efve Bayes classifier assumes that the effect of the value of an attribute (x) on a given class (c) is independent of the values of other predictors (Spann et al. 2020 ) 5 P(c | x) is the posterior probability of class given attribute, P(x | c) is the likelihood which is the probability of the attribute given class, P(x) is the prior probability of attribute, P(c) is the prior probability of a class, k-means ( Fujita et al. 2020 ) which is used to define k centers, one for each cluster and these centres should be placed far away from each other. This algorithm also aims at minimizing an objective function which is known as squared error function, given by : 6 ||x i -v j || is the Euclidean distance between x i -v j, Ci is the number of data points in ith cluster, C is the number of cluster center\u2019s, convolution neural network which is a type of feed-forward artificial neural network in which the connectivity pattern between its neurons is inspired by the organization of the animal visual cortex. Convolution is the first step in the process that convolution neural network undergoes (Zhang et al. 2019 ) 7 where (f*g)(t) = functions that are being convoluted, t = real number variable of functions f and g, g( ) = convolution of time function, = first derivative of tau function, a recurrent neural network which is used for handling sequential data and its formula in which h(t) is a function f of the previously hidden state h(t \u2212 1) and the current input x(t). The theta are the parameters of the function f is (Yang et al. 2020 ) 8 Boltzmann machine, which optimizes the weights, a quantity related to the particular problem. Its main objective is to maximize the Consensus function (CF), which is given by the following formula (Zhou et al. 2019 ) 9 where U i and U j are the set of units, w ij is the fixed weight, gradient descent which is an iterative process and is formulated by (Chang et al. 2018 ) where 1 is the next position, 0 is the current position, is the small step, is the direction of fastest increase) in healthcare (Zhang et al. 2017 ). The extensive survey also promotes expounding prevailing knowledge gaps and subsequent identification of paths for future research (Lin et al. 2019 ). The current study reformed the structure, which produced wide-ranging article valuation standards from earlier published articles. Articles incorporated in our research are selected using keywords like \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d, \u201cDisease Detection\u201d, \u201cDisease diagnosis using machine learning\u201d, \u201cDisease diagnosis using deep learning\u201d, \u201cArtificial Intelligence in Healthcare\u201d, and combinations of these keywords. In addition, research articles associated with the applications of AI-based techniques in predicting diseases and diagnosing them are incorporated for review. Table 1 lists the publications that are included or omitted based on a variety of criteria such as time, studies to define how old papers/articles can be accessed, the problem on which the article is based, comparative analysis of the work, methods to represent the techniques used, and research design to analyse the results that are obtained. These characteristics assisted us in carrying out the research study very quickly, without wasting time on irrelevant or unnecessary searches and investigations. The standards for inclusion and exclusion are developed by the requirements of the problem of an article. Inclusion and exclusion parameters S. no. Parameters Inclusion standards Exclusion standards 1. Period Research works conducted between 2009 and 2020 Articles published before 2009 2. Investigations Research works focusing on disease diagnosis using AI Research works focusing other than disease diagnosis 3. Comparator Research studies aiming to detect the disease Research works making predictive models other than detecting diseases 4. Methodology Research articles using ML/DL methods Research articles using methods other than ML/DL 5. Design of Study Original articles comprising of experimental results Review articles, case studies, Patents Language other than English Research articles included in this review are identified using several quality evaluation constraints. The significance of the study is assessed based on inclusion and exclusion standards. All research articles included for review encompass machine or deep learning-based prediction models for automatically detecting and diagnosing diseases. Each research work incorporated in this study carried empirical research and had experimental outcomes. The description of these research articles is stated in a separate subsection entitled literature survey. The comprehensive selection of research papers is carried out in four phases: (1) identifying where records are identified through various databases. At this phase, we must do the searches we\u2019ve planned through the abstract and citation databases we\u2019ve chosen. Take note of how many results the searches returned. We can also include data found in other places, such as Google Scholar or the reference lists of related papers. Then, in one citation management application, aggregate all of the records retrieved from the searches. Keep in mind that each database has its own set of rules for searching for terms of interest and combining keywords for a more efficient search. As a result, our search technique may vary significantly depending on the database, (2) screening the selection process is done transparently by reporting on decisions made at various stages of the systematic review. One of the investigators reviews the title and abstract of each record to see if the publication provides information that might be useful or relevant to the systematic review. In certain situations, the title and abstract screening is done by two investigators. They don\u2019t split the job amongst themselves! Each investigator screens every title and abstract, and then their judgments are compared. If one of them decides to leave out an item that the other thinks should be included, they may go over the entire text together and come to a common conclusion. They can also enlist the help of a third party (usually the project manager or main investigator) to decide whether or not the study should be included. Make sure that the most acceptable justification for excluding an item is chosen. (3) Eligibility we study the complete contents of the articles that cleared the title and abstract screening to see whether they may assist in answering our research topic. Two investigators do this full-text screening. Each one examines the entire content of each article before deciding whether or not to include it. We must note the number of articles we remove and the number of articles under each cause for exclusion in the full-text screening, just as we did in the title/abstract screening. Hence, in this stage, full-text articles are assessed and then finally are included in qualitative analysis in (4) included phase by utilizing the Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) flowchart as depicted in Fig. 2 . In this stage, we\u2019ll know how many papers will be included in our systematic review after removing irrelevant studies from the full-text screen. We assess how many of these studies may be included in a quantitative synthesis, commonly known as \u201cmeta-analysis,\u201c in the fourth and final screening stage. PRISMA flow chart To address the RQ1, RQ2, RQ3, and RQ4, the current survey examined the number of articles on different disease diagnoses using AI techniques from various data sources, including Psychological Information, Excerpta Medica Database, Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The above sources are popular sources of information for articles on AI in health informatics in previous studies. As previously explained, articles are chosen based on specified inclusion and exclusion criteria (Zhang et al. 2017 ). These were derived from (Behera et al. 2019 ), where the authors established and accepted the variations. To better understand the state of research on AI in disease detection, peer-reviewed papers are cited. The current review suggests that AI and healthcare have developed a present synergy. Investigation 1: Why do we need AI? Investigation 2: What is the impact of AI on medical diagnosis and treatment? Investigation 3: Why is AI important, and how is it used to analyse these diseases? Investigation 4: Which AI-based algorithm is used in disease diagnosis? Investigation 5: What are the challenges faced by the researchers while using AI models in several disease diagnoses? Investigation 6: How are AI-based techniques helping doctors in diagnosing diseases? Detecting any irresistible ailment is nearly an afterward movement and forestalling its spread requires ongoing data and examination. Hence, acting rapidly with accurate data tosses a significant effect on the lives of individuals around the globe socially and financially (Minaee et al. 2020 ). The best thing about applying AI in health care is to improve from gathering and processing valuable data to programming surgeon robots. This section expounds on the various techniques and applications of artificial intelligence, disease symptoms, diagnostics issues, and a framework for disease detection modelling using learning models and AI in healthcare applications (Kumar and Singla 2021 ). AI describes the capability of a machine to study the way a human learns, e.g., through image identification and detecting pattern in a problematic situation. AI in health care alters how information gets composed, analysed, and developed for patient care (Ali et al. 2019 ). System planning is the fundamental abstract design of the system. It includes the framework\u2019s views, the course of action of the framework, and how the framework carries on underneath clear conditions. A solid grip of the framework design can help the client realize the limits and boundaries of the said framework. Figure 3 shows a pictorial portrayal of the ailment recognition model using utilitarian machines and profound learning classification strategies. In pre-preparing, real-world information requires upkeep and pre-preparing before being taken care of by the calculation (Jo et al. 2019 ). Because of the justifiable explanation, real-world data regularly contains mistakes regarding the utilized measures yet cannot practice such blunders. Accordingly, information pre-preparing takes this crude information, cycles it, eliminates errors, and spares it an extra examination. Information experiences a progression of steps during pre-handling (Chen et al. 2019a , b ): Information is purged by various strategies in information cleaning. These strategies involve gathering information, such as filling the information spaces that are left clear or decreasing information, such as the disposal of commas or other obscure characters. In information osmosis, the information is joined from a combination of sources. The information is then amended for any blend of mistakes, and they are quickly taken care of. Information Alteration : Data in this progression is standardized, which depends upon the given calculation. Information standardization can be executed utilizing several ways (Nasser et al. 2019 ). This progression is obligatory in most information mining calculations, as the information wants to be as perfect as possible. Information is then mutual and developed. Information Lessening : This progression in the strategy centers to diminish the information to more helpful levels. Informational collection and test information : The informational collection is segregated into parts preparing and testing informational indexes. The preparation information is utilized to gauge the actual examples of the data (Sarao et al. 2020 ). Equivalent to information needed for preparing and testing, experimental data is often replicated from a similar informational index. After the model has been pre-handled, the jiffy step is to test the accuracy of the framework. Systematic model : Analytical displaying strategies are utilized to calculate the probability of a given occurrence function given commitment factors, and it is very productive in illness expectation. It tends to imagine what the individual is experiencing in light of their info indications and prior determinations (Keenan et al. 2020 ; Rajalakshmi et al. 2018 ). Clinical Imaging is seen to assign the arrangement of procedures that produce pictures of the inside part of the body. The procedure and cycles are used to take pictures of the human body for clinical purposes, such as uncovering, analysing, or looking at an injury, brokenness, and pathology (Bibault et al. 2020 ). Computed tomography (CT) scan outputs are great representations of helpful indicative imaging that encourages exact conclusion, mediation, and evaluation of harms and dysfunctions that actual advisors address consistently (Chen et al. 2017 ). Additional contemplates demonstrate overuse of Imaging, for example, X-rays or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for intense and complicated work, as shown in Table 2 . Medical imaging types with their respective descriptions Medical imaging types Description Radiographic imaging (Zhang et al. 2019 ) Radiographic imaging is utilized in the ionizing of electromagnetic radiation, for example, X-beams to see objects Fluoroscopy (Santroo et al. 2019 ) It creates ongoing pictures of the body\u2019s interior structures that consistently contribute X-beams at a lower portion rate to give moving projection radiographs of lower quality Angiography (Katharine et al. 2019 ) Angiography is utilized to discover aneurysms, releases, blockages, new vessel development, and arrangement of catheters and stents DEXA (Yang et al. 2020 ) It is likewise called Dual X-beam Absorptiometry or bone densitometry which is utilized for osteoporosis tests Computed tomography (CT) (Kasasbeh et al. 2019 ) Computed tomography examination utilizes an immense measure of ionizing radiation related to a PC to make pictures of delicate and hard tissues Magnetic resonance imaging (Zhou et al. 2019 ) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) filtering is a clinical examination that utilizes an excellent magnet and radiofrequency waves to create a body picture Ultrasound imaging (Sloun et al. 2019 ) It utilizes high recurrence broadband sound waves in the megahertz range that are reflected by tissue to differing degrees to deliver 3D pictures Bone scan (Gupta et al. 2019 ) It is an imaging procedure that utilizes a radioactive compound to distinguish the regions of mending within the bone Electron microscopy (Tegunov et al. 2019 ) Electron microscopy is a magnifying instrument that can amplify tiny subtleties with high settling power Nuclear medicine (Nensa et al. 2019 ) Nuclear medication on an entire incorporates both the finding and treatment of infections utilizing atomic properties Magnetic resonance angiography scans (Fujita et al. 2020 ) Magnetic resonance angiography represents an attractive reverberation angiogram that gives exceptionally itemized pictures of the veins in the body The disease may be severe, persistent, cruel, or benign. Of these terms, persistent and severe have to do with the interval of a disease, lethal and begin with the potential for causing death. Additionally, different manifestations that may be irrelevant could post the warnings for more restorative severe illness or situation. The followings are a couple of diseases with their sign and indications for events: Heart assault signs incorporate hurt, nervousness, crushing, or feeling of breadth in the focal point of the chest that endures more than a couple of moments; agony or anxiety in different territories of the chest area; succinctness of breath; cold perspiration; heaving; or unsteadiness (Aggarwal et al. 2020 ). Stroke signs incorporate facial listing, arm shortcoming, the intricacy with discourse, quickly creating happiness or equalization, unexpected absence of sensation or weak point, loss of vision, puzzlement, or agonizing torment (Lukwanto et al. 2015 ). Reproductive wellbeing manages the signs that develop the issues such as blood misfortune or spotting between periods; tingling, copying, disturbance at genital region; agony or disquiet during intercourse; genuine or sore feminine dying; extreme pelvic/stomach torment; strange vaginal release; the sentiment of totality in the lower mid-region; and customary pee or urinary weight (Kather et al. 2019 ). Breast issue side effects include areola release, abnormal bosom delicacy or torment, bosom or areola skin changes, knot or thickening in or close to bosom or in the underarm zone (Memon et al. 2019 ). Lung issue side effects include hacking of blood, succinctness of breath, difficult breathing, consistent hack, rehashed episodes of bronchitis or pneumonia, and puffing (Ma et al. 2020 ). Stomach or stomach-related issue manifestations incorporate rectal dying, blood in the stool or dark stools, changes in gut properties or not having the option to control guts, stoppage, loose bowels, indigestion or heartburn, or spewing blood (Kather et al. 2019 ). Bladder issue manifestations include confounded or excruciating pee, incessant pee, loss of bladder control, blood in pee, waking routinely to pee around evening time to pee or wetting the bed around evening time, or spilling pee (Shkolyar et al. 2019 ). Skin issue indications remember changes for skin moles, repetitive flushing and redness of face and neck, jaundice, skin sores that do not disappear or re-establish to wellbeing, new development or moles on the skin, and thick, red skin with bright patches (Rodrigues et al. 2020 ). Emotional issues include nervousness, sadness, weariness, feeling tense, flashbacks and bad dreams, lack of engagement in daily exercises, self-destructive musings, mind flights, and fancies (Krittanawong et al. 2018 ). Headache issues indications (excluding ordinary strain cerebral pains) incorporate migraines that please unexpectedly, \u201cthe most noticeably awful migraine of your life\u201d, and cerebral pain connected with extreme energy, queasiness, heaving, and powerlessness to walk (Mueller 2020 ). Above, we have described the variety of illness signals and their symptoms. In contrast, illness recognition errors in medication are reasonably regular, can have a stringent penalty, and are only now the foundation to materialize outstandingly in patient safety. Here we have critical issues for various diagnostic types while detecting the particular diseases (Chuang 2011 ; Park et al. 2020 ). Analysis that is accidentally deferred wrong, or on the other hand, missed as decided from a definitive delight of more amazing data. Any fault or malfunction in the analytical course which is essential to a missed finding or a conceded conclusion comprises a breakdown in occasional admittance to mind; elicitation or comprehension of side effects, images, research facility result; detailing and weighing of difference investigation; and ideal development and strength arrangement or appraisal. The healthcare system has long been an early adopter of generally innovative technologies. Today, artificial intelligence and its subset machine and deep learning are on their way to becoming a mean element in the healthcare system, from creating new health check actions to treat patient records and accounts. One of the maximum burdens physician practices today is the association and performance of organizational tasks (Fukuda et al. 2019 ). By automating them, healthcare institutions could help resolve the trouble and allow physicians to do their best, i.e., spend more time with patients. The following are the details of the artificial intelligence techniques in healthcare applications as shown in Table 3 : Healthcare applications and their purpose Healthcare applications Purpose Analysis and disease identification (Memon et al. 2019 ) One of the most critical uses of the machine and profound learning calculations in medical care is identified with the acknowledgment and investigation of sicknesses that are estimated hard to diagnose Drug development (Memon et al. 2019 ) The beginning phase of the drug identification measure is a different zone that can greatly advance from the machine and profound learning. Solo AI is beneficial to distinguish designs in information without giving any forecast Customized medicine (Chatterjee et al. 2018 ) Medicines are most solid when they are imparted to only wellbeing factors. As of now, doctors can lean toward a lack of conclusion or inexact danger to their patients based on their characteristic history and the open acquired data Digital health records (Luo et al. 2019 ) They are keeping up just as vital well-being records are a long and expensive cycle. As a result, they have assumed an important function in encouraging the data access measure Medical trials (Romanini et al. 2020 ) It is based on machine and profound learning that relies on expository examination to perceive conceivable clinical preliminary applicants, where scientists can contract down their pool from a wide assortment of information Information crowdsourcing (Rodrigues et al. 2016 ) The wellbeing field has been publicly supporting, and nowadays\u2019 specialists utilize the strategy to get to a tremendous measure of information that individuals transfer Outbreak prediction (Chen et al. 2019a , b ) Machine and profound learning-based procedures are utilized to screen and expect flare-ups about the world to anticipate the scourge Medical imaging diagnostics (Nasser et al. 2019 ) Simulated intelligence strategies end up being broader, just as productive in their capacity to see an expanding measure of information sources from different clinical pictures This section highlights the best finding for different diseases with their diagnosis methods via machine and deep learning algorithms. It covers the extensive survey on various diseases such as alzheimer\u2019s, cancer, diabetes, chronic, heart disease, tuberculosis, stroke and cerebrovascular, hypertension, skin and liver disease (Chui et al. 2020 ). Alzheimer\u2019s is a disease that worsens the dementia symptoms over several years (Zebene et al. 2019 ). During its early stage, it affects memory loss, but in the end, it loses the ability to carry the conservation and respond to the environment. Usyal et al. ( 2020 ) decided on the analysis of dementia in Alzheimer\u2019s through investigating neuron pictures. They utilized the alzheimer\u2019s disease neuroimaging initiative convention that comprises T1 weighted magnetic resonance information for finding. The prescient shows the precision estimated the characterization models, affectability, and explicitness esteem. Ljubic et al. ( 2020 ) presented the method to diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s disease from electronic medical record (EMR) data. The results acquired showed the accuracy by 90% on using the SCRL dataset. Soundarya et al. ( 2020 ) proposed the methodology in which description of shrink brain tissue is used for the ancient analysis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. They have implemented various machine and deep learning algorithms. The deep algorithm has been considered the better solution provider to recognize the ailment at its primary stage with reasonable accuracy. Park et al. ( 2020 ) used a vast range of organizational health data to test the chance of machine learning models to expect the outlook occurrence of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Lin et al. ( 2019 ) proposed a method that used the spectrogram features extracted from speech data to identify Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The system used the voice data collected via the internet of things (IoT) and transmitted to the cloud server where the original data is stored. The received data is used for training the model to identify the Alzheimer\u2019s disease symptoms. As seen in Fig. 4 , (Subasi 2020 ) proposed a broad framework for detecting Alzheimer\u2019s illness using AI methods. The learning process is the process of optimizing model parameters using a training dataset or prior practice. Learning models can be predictive, predicting the future, descriptive, collecting data from input data sources, and combining them. Two critical stages are performed in machine learning and deep learning: pre-processing the vast input and improving the model. The second phase involves effectively testing the learning model and resembling the answer. Oh et al. ( 2019 ) offered a technique for demonstrating the end-to-end learning of four binary classification problems using a volumetric convolutional neural network form. The trials are performed on the ADNI database, and the results indicated that the suggested technique obtained an accuracy of 86.60% and a precision of 73.95%, respectively. Raza et al. ( 2019 ) proposed a unique AI-based examination and observation of Alzheimer\u2019s disorder. The analysis results appeared at 82% improvement in contrast with notable existing procedures. Alzheimer\u2019s disease detection using artificial intelligence techniques (Subasi 2020 ) Additionally, above 95% precision is accomplished to order the exercises of everyday living, which are very reassuring regarding checking the action profile of the subject.

( 2018 ) Scalp disease Data collected from scalp hair physiotherapist Deep learning, Recurrent Neural Network Precision: 97.41\u201399.09% From Table 4 , we can observe that AI techniques have proven to be the best for detecting diseases with improved results. AI uses machine and deep learning models that work upon training and testing data sets so that the system can see the disease and diagnose it early. In the AI-based model, we initially need to train human beings to remember the data and provide accurate results. However, it also deals with the problem. Suppose the training data produced the incorrect analysis of disease because of insufficient information, which artificial intelligence cannot factor. As a result, it will become a horrible condition for the patients as AI cannot assure us whether the prediction regarding disease detection is accurate. On assaying the accuracy of algorithms in diagnosing the disease, deep learning classifiers have dominated over machine learning models in the field of disease diagnosis. Deep learning models have proved to be best in terms of scalp disease by 99%, Alzheimer disease by 96%, thyroid disease by 99%, 96% in skin disease, 99.37% in case of Arrhythmia disease, 95.7% in diabetic disease, while as machine learning models achieved 89% in diabetic disease, 88.67% in tuberculosis, 86.84% in Alzheimer disease, etc. We have presented recently published research studies that employed AI-based Learning techniques for diagnosing the disease in the current review. This study highlights research on disease diagnosis prediction and predicting the post-operative life expectancy of diseased patients using AI-based learning techniques. Investigation 1 : Why do we need AI? We know that AI is the simulation of human processes by machines (computer systems) and that this simulation includes learning, reasoning, and self-correction. We require AI since the amount of labour we must perform is rising daily. As a result, it\u2019s a good idea to automate regular tasks. It conserves the organization\u2019s staff and also boosts production (Vasal et al. 2020 ). In terms of the healthcare industry, AI in health refers to a set of diverse technologies that enable robots to detect, comprehend, act, and learn1 to execute administrative and clinical healthcare activities. AI has the potential to transform healthcare by addressing some of the industry\u2019s most pressing issues. For example, AI can result in improved patient outcomes and increased productivity and efficiency in care delivery (Gouda et al. 2020 ). It can also enhance healthcare practitioners\u2019 daily lives by spending more time caring for patients, therefore increasing staff morale and retention. In addition, it may potentially help bring life-saving medicines to market more quickly. Figure 8 shows the significance of AI in the medical field. Investigation 2 : Why is AI important, and how is it used to analyse the disease? The emergence of new diseases remains a critical parameter in human health and society. Hence, the advances in AI allow for rapid processing and analysis of such massive and complex data. It recommends the correct decision for over ten different diseases (as mentioned in the literature) with at least 98% accuracy. Doctors use technologies such as computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging to produce a detailed 3D map of the area that needs to be diagnosed. Later, AI technology analyse s the system-generated image using machine and deep learning models to spot the diseased area\u2019s features in seconds. As shown in the framework section, an artificial intelligence model using machine and deep learning algorithms is initially trained with the help of a particular disease dataset (Owasis et al. 2019 ). The dataset is then pre-processed using data cleaning and transformation techniques so that the disease symptoms in the form of feature vectors can be extracted and further diagnosed. Suppose doctors do not use AI techniques. In that case, it will cause a delay in treating the patients as it is tough to interpret the scanned image manually, and it also takes a considerable amount of time. But, on the other hand, it shows that an AI technique helps the patients and helps the doctors save the patient\u2019s life by treating them as early as possible (Luo et al. 2019 ). Investigation 3 : What is the impact of AI in medical diagnosis? Due to advancements in computer power, learning algorithms, and the availability of massive datasets (big data) derived from medical records and wearable health monitors. The best part of implementing AI in healthcare is that it helps to enhance various areas, including illness detection, disease classification, decision-making processes, giving optimal treatment choices, and ultimately, helping people live longer. In terms of disease diagnosis, AI has been used to enhance medical diagnosis (Chen et al. 2019a , b ). For example, the technology, which is currently in use in China, may detect hazardous tumors and nodules in patients with lung cancer, allowing physicians to provide an early diagnosis rather than sending tissue samples to a lab for testing, allowing for earlier treatment (Keenan et al. 2020 ). Figure 9 illustrates the influence of artificial intelligence and other approaches. Investigation 4 : Which AI-based algorithm is used in disease diagnosis? Disease detection algorithms driven by AI demonstrated to be an effective tool for identifying undiagnosed patients with under-diagnosed, uncoded, and rare diseases. Therefore, AI models for disease detection have an ample opportunity to drive earlier diagnosis for patients in need and guide pharmaceutical companies with highly advanced, targeted diagnostics to help these patients get correctly diagnosed and treated earlier in their disease journey (Keenan et al. 2020 ). The research work mentioned in the literature has covered both machine and deep learning models for diagnosing the diseases such as cancer, diabetes, chronic, heart disease, alzheimer, stroke and cerebrovascular, hypertension, skin, and liver disease. Machine learning models, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, Fuzzy logics, Gradient Boosting Machines, Decision Tree, K nearest neighbour (KNN), and Support vector machines (SVM) are primarily used in literature. Among deep learning models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been used most commonly for disease diagnosis. In addition, faster Recurrent Convolution Neural Network, Multilayer Perceptron, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) have also been used extensively in the literature. Figure 10 displays the usage of AI-based prediction models in the literature. Artificial intelligence-based prediction models Investigation 5 : What are the challenges faced by the researchers while using AI models in several disease diagnosis? Although AI-based techniques have marked their significance in disease diagnosis, there are still many challenges faced by the researchers that need to be addressed. i. Limited Data size The most common challenge faced by most of the studies was insufficient data to train the model. A small sample size implies a smaller training set which does not authenticate the efficiency of the proposed approaches. On the other hand, good sample size can train the model better than the limited one (Rajalakshmi et al. 2018 ). ii. High dimensionality Another data-related issue faced in cancer research is high dimensionality. High dimensionality is referred to a vast number of features as compared to cases. However, multiple dimensionality reduction techniques are available to deal with this issue (Bibault et al. 2020 ). iii. Efficient feature selection technique Many studies have achieved exceptional prediction outcomes. However, a computationally effective feature selection method is required to eradicate the data cleaning procedures while generating high disease prediction accuracy (Koshimizu et al. 2020 ). iv. Model Generalizability A shift in research towards improving the generalizability of the model is required. Most of the studies have proposed a prediction model that is validated on a single site. There is a need to validate the models on multiple sites that can help improve the model\u2019s generalizability (Fukuda et al. 2019 ). v. Clinical Implementation AI-based models have proved their dominance in medical research; still, the practical implementation of the models in the clinics is not incorporated. These models need to be validated in a clinical setting to assist the medical practitioner in affirming the diagnosis verdicts (Huang et al. 2020 ). Investigation 6 : How artificial intelligence-based techniques are helping doctors in diagnosing diseases? AI improves the lives of patients, physicians, and hospital managers by doing activities usually performed by people but in a fraction of the time and the expense. For example, AI assists physicians in making suggestions by evaluating vast amounts of healthcare data such as electronic health records, symptom data, and physician reports to improve health outcomes and eventually save the patient\u2019s life (Kohlberger et al. 2019 ). Additionally, this data aids in the improvement and acceleration of decision-making while diagnosing and treating patients\u2019 illnesses using artificial intelligence-based approaches. Not only that, AI assists physicians in detecting diseases by utilizing complicated algorithms, hundreds of biomarkers, imaging findings from millions of patients, aggregated published clinical studies, and thousands of physicians\u2019 notes to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. When it comes to disease diagnosis, accuracy is critical for planning, effective treatment and ensuring the well-being of patients. AI is a vast and diverse realm of data, algorithms, analytics, deep learning, neural networks, and insights that is constantly expanding and adapting to the needs of the healthcare industry and its patients. According to the findings of this study, AI approaches in the healthcare system, particularly for illness detection, are essential. Aiming at illuminating how machine and deep learning techniques work in various disease diagnosis areas, the current study has been divided into several sections that cover the diagnosis of alzheimer\u2019s, cancer, diabetes, chronic diseases, heart disease, stroke and cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, skin disease, and liver disease. The introduction and contribution were covered in the first section, followed by an evaluation of the quality of the work and an examination of AI approaches and applications. Later, various illness symptoms and diagnostic difficulties, a paradigm for AI in disease detection models, and various AI applications in healthcare were discussed. The reported work on multiple diseases and the comparative analysis of different techniques with the used dataset as well as the results of an applied machine and deep learning methods in terms of multiple parameters such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, an area under the curve, and F-score has also been portrayed. Finally, the work that assisted researchers in determining the most effective method for detecting illnesses is finished, as in future scope. In a nutshell, medical experts better understand how AI may be used for illness diagnosis, leading to more appropriate proposals for the future development of AI based techniques. Contrary to considerable advancements over the past several years, the area of accurate clinical diagnostics faces numerous obstacles that must be resolved and improved constantly to treat emerging illnesses and diseases effectively. Even healthcare professionals recognize the barriers that must be overcome before sickness may be detected in conjunction with artificial intelligence. Even doctors do not entirely rely on AI-based approaches at this time since they are unclear of their ability to anticipate illnesses and associated symptoms. Thus much work is required to train the AI-based systems so that there will be an increase in the accuracy to predict the methods for diagnosing diseases. Hence, in the future, AI-based research should be conducted by keeping the flaw mentioned earlier in consideration to provide a mutually beneficial relationship between AI and clinicians. In addition to this, a decentralized federated learning model should also be applied to create a single training model for disease datasets at remote places for the early diagnosis of diseases.

theories of distributive justice.", "Doug MacKay , associate professor in the College\u2019s public policy department, grew interested in UBI through research into paternalism in the U.S. social safety net.", "\nWendt: It is a regular cash payment by the government that is given on a monthly or annual basis.", "It\u2019s unconditional in several respects.", "In contrast to many other welfare programs that you only get when you prove your willingness to work, a UBI would be unconditional in that respect.", "It would also be unconditional on what money you make, what you have in general and on what contribution you made to finance the UBI.", "Finally, it would be unconditional on your family situation, on whether you\u2019re married or not.", "\nUBI is probably best conceived as a floor to stand on, not as a safety net.", "A safety net is only meant to catch you when you need it, which requires some institution to test whether you really need it, and that opens up all these worries about paternalism, bureaucracy and so on, whereas the UBI would be a floor to stand on for everybody.", "\nMacKay:", "I completely agree with Fabian\u2019s description.", "UBI is a platform to stand on and to build a life on.", "But it\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to allow you to live a great life.", "The sort of numbers that we\u2019re talking about are, at most, $1,000 a month per person.", "People will still have a strong motivation to work.", "\nMacKay:", "The goals really differ, depending on the policymaker but also on who\u2019s proposing it.", "I think for a lot of folks on the left, they see it as more a platform to build your life on.", "So it\u2019s going to be there for you when you when you need it.", "\nIf you think about the pandemic, when people are losing their jobs, it takes a long time for government to react.", "Had we had a basic income in place, that would have been a way of ensuring people are secure, have the ability to meet their basic needs and live a dignified human life.", "They don\u2019t need to appeal to various agencies.", "They have consistency in terms of being able to afford housing, food and so on.", "It\u2019s an anti-poverty measure.", "\nYou also see from people on the left the idea of UBI as promoting freedom.", "Oftentimes we talk about freedom as being freedom from constraints.", "Some folks on the right, libertarians in particular, emphasize the need for government to stay out of our lives.", "And thinkers on the left often point out that if people are just leaving you alone, you might be unlimited in terms of choices, but you\u2019re not actually going to be able to do anything unless you have resources.", "So the idea is that if people have a platform to build their lives off, they have resources every month.", "They can actually do things.", "They can meet their needs.", "They can pursue various projects.", "\nOn the right side of the political spectrum, people see UBI as potentially realizing a number of goals.", "One, they emphasize this is anti-paternalistic in nature.", "There\u2019s an element of government not interfering with the lives of individuals by imposing all these conditionalities on them, but rather just letting them be free to live their lives as they see fit with the income.", "\nThe other thing that folks on the right emphasize is the way UBI might allow you to shrink the size of government.", "People on the left often think of basic income as something we\u2019re going to add to the safety net and keep much of the safety net intact.", "People on the right often see it as a replacement: We\u2019re going to give people a guaranteed income, and we\u2019re going to get rid of a whole host of social safety net programs that cost a lot of money and require a lot of people to administer.", "\nWendt:", "One thing I found interesting about Andrew Yang\u2019s proposal was his idea to let people choose whether they either take the UBI or keep the benefits from current programs.", "\nAnother thing different proponents will disagree upon is how high UBI should be.", "A thousand dollars a month was Yang\u2019s proposal, but you could also go much lower or much higher.", "Maybe even \u201cas high as is sustainable,\u201d as [Belgian philosopher and economist and chief UBI proponent Philippe] Van Parijs would say.", "\nIts sustainability will depend on how high it is pitched, but also on how it\u2019s financed.", "It seems very natural to think that it would be financed through the income tax.", "That would make it a close relative to a negative income tax proposal, which was popular in the 1960s and \u201970s.", "[The influential American economist] Milton Friedman was a famous advocate of that.", "But Andrew Yang and others propose a mix in terms of how it\u2019s financed.", "It could also be a sales tax or capital income tax or some other way.", "\nWendt: UBI has often been seen as a response to the challenge of automation \u2014 the worry that many people are going to become unemployed and replaced by machines.", "For example, truck drivers will lose their jobs once there are automated trucks.", "In the end, that\u2019s not a new concern, though.", "People have worried that machines would replace jobs at least since the 19th century, but usually new types of jobs were always created elsewhere.", "\nThe idea of a UBI was brought up last spring as a response to the pandemic \u2014 an emergency UBI.", "The coronavirus hit so hard.", "Many people felt like this was a chance to get some serious reform of the welfare state going.", "In the end we got the stimulus checks instead, which were not completely different, but a one-time thing, and not unconditional.", "The checks depended on how much you earned.", "\nOne thing to emphasize is also how UBI would empower women.", "It gives working mothers cash to pay for childcare, for example, or it makes it easier to leave an abusive husband if you have something to rely on that is independent from the family situation.", "\nMacKay:", "The other thing I would point to are concerns about income inequality.", "I don\u2019t think this is necessarily a great solution to the problem of income inequality, but I think the economic anxiety leads people to UBI.", "\nMacKay:", "There\u2019s been a variety of studies.", "There were a couple of really famous experiments in the \u201970s in Canada and here in the United States.", "There was a really interesting study in Manitoba in the late \u201970s, where they had a whole town that was subject to a guaranteed income policy \u2014 a floor that families would not fall below.", "A lot of randomized controlled trials in low-income countries have been using cash transfers since the late \u201980s, early \u201990s.", "Some of these are conditional cash transfers.", "In Mexico, for example, you might get a cash transfer from the government if you send your kids to school and take them for yearly doctor visits.", "And there was one recently in Finland, where they gave $500 per month to unemployed folks.", "\nThese are high-quality studies.", "The evidence has shown that the UBI programs are pretty effective in a number of different ways.", "The caveat I would give is that they happen in different contexts, and the interventions are very different.", "\nWendt: An experiment in Kenya is the largest.", "It involves around 20,000 people and unconditional cash payments that cover basic needs.", "It started in 2017 and will last 12 years.", "There are four different groups.", "One group gets the cash for the whole 12 years.", "Another group gets paid up front rather than on a monthly basis, I believe.", "Another group receives payments for a shorter period of time.", "And then there\u2019s a control group that doesn\u2019t get any cash.", "Some people reported that it has changed how women see their role in the household, because they felt entitled to have a say over how to spend the money.", "\nMacKay:", "A big one is a reciprocity worry \u2014 that in order to get access to public benefits, you should be at least willing to participate in the labor market.", "\nThink of the earned-income tax credit.", "That\u2019s a cash transfer that goes to low-income Americans.", "But to get access to it, you need to be participating in the labor force.", "A lot of programs like SNAP", "[the federal government\u2019s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as the Food Stamp Program] and TANF [Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, another federal program] have work requirements attached to them.", "The Trump administration was trying to attach a work requirement to Medicaid programs, as well.", "The thought is, you should only get access to public benefits if you are participating in the formal labor market and earning an income.", "\nThe question they ask is: Why should some group of individuals be participating in the labor force and paying taxes to fund a UBI for other people who aren\u2019t participating in the labor market?", "One of the responses to this is that UBI recognizes all those forms of contribution to society that aren\u2019t remunerated.", "Think about parents taking care of their children or poor people taking care of elderly family members.", "There\u2019s lots of ways in which people contribute to society.", "And you can think of a UBI as reciprocating in that sense, remunerating people for those contributions.", "\nWendt: Another common worry is that UBI is a waste of money on the wealthy.", "Why should all of those wealthy people get a monthly check?", "If the goal is to do something about poverty, then why UBI, since the rich by definition are not poor?", "That\u2019s an understandable concern for sure.", "But the reply there is that depending on how the UBI is financed, the rich will not be net beneficiaries.", "They will contribute more to finance the UBI than what they get as their monthly check.\nMacKay:", "This is the first time I\u2019ve heard of a guaranteed income program that\u2019s aimed at people coming out of prison.", "I think it makes perfect sense.", "Part of the justification here is that people with a felony record face a lot of difficulty in terms of accessing other public programs.", "I think they\u2019re actually banned for at least some period of time from federal housing programs and from receiving SNAP benefits.", "Felons face a lot of difficulty getting jobs.", "Employers can legitimately ask if they have a record and deny them employment

Well"], "rawDocumentText": "Unconditional cash payments to residents are more of a floor to stand on than a safety net, say these Carolina scholars in light of a proposed pilot project to give $500 per month to formerly incarcerated Durham, North Carolina, residents.\nThe idea of governments giving residents no-strings-attached cash payments is picking up steam, due in part to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Last June, Mayor Michael Tubbs of Stockton, California, created Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, a coalition to \u201cadvocate for a guaranteed income \u2014 direct, recurring cash payments \u2014 that lifts all of our communities, building a resilient, just America.\u201d\nDurham Mayor Steve Schewel joined the group. In January, Schewel announced that Durham was one of 30 U.S. cities being considered to receive a $500,000 slice of a $15 million gift from Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey. The money would fund Universal Basic Income pilot projects, such as the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration . Durham council member Mark-Anthony Middleton announced that Durham\u2019s proposed project would guarantee $500 per month to 55 formerly incarcerated residents until the pandemic ends and the city\u2019s economy recovers.\nBefore the pandemic hit, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang put UBI, also known as guaranteed basic income, on the map by making it his signature policy. His proposed \u201cFreedom Dividend\u201d \u2014 $1,000 per month payments to every American adult \u2014 was a response to job displacement by automation.\nFor a deeper understanding of this issue, The Well spoke with two Carolina faculty members who have studied UBI. Fabian Wendt , a teaching assistant professor in the College of Arts & Sciences\u2019 philosophy department and the philosophy, politics & economics program, first came across UBI while studying theories of distributive justice. Doug MacKay , associate professor in the College\u2019s public policy department, grew interested in UBI through research into paternalism in the U.S. social safety net.\nWendt: It is a regular cash payment by the government that is given on a monthly or annual basis. It\u2019s unconditional in several respects. In contrast to many other welfare programs that you only get when you prove your willingness to work, a UBI would be unconditional in that respect. It would also be unconditional on what money you make, what you have in general and on what contribution you made to finance the UBI. Finally, it would be unconditional on your family situation, on whether you\u2019re married or not.\nUBI is probably best conceived as a floor to stand on, not as a safety net. A safety net is only meant to catch you when you need it, which requires some institution to test whether you really need it, and that opens up all these worries about paternalism, bureaucracy and so on, whereas the UBI would be a floor to stand on for everybody.\nMacKay: I completely agree with Fabian\u2019s description. UBI is a platform to stand on and to build a life on. But it\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to allow you to live a great life. The sort of numbers that we\u2019re talking about are, at most, $1,000 a month per person. People will still have a strong motivation to work.\nMacKay: The goals really differ, depending on the policymaker but also on who\u2019s proposing it. I think for a lot of folks on the left, they see it as more a platform to build your life on. So it\u2019s going to be there for you when you when you need it.\nIf you think about the pandemic, when people are losing their jobs, it takes a long time for government to react. Had we had a basic income in place, that would have been a way of ensuring people are secure, have the ability to meet their basic needs and live a dignified human life. They don\u2019t need to appeal to various agencies. They have consistency in terms of being able to afford housing, food and so on. It\u2019s an anti-poverty measure.\nYou also see from people on the left the idea of UBI as promoting freedom. Oftentimes we talk about freedom as being freedom from constraints. Some folks on the right, libertarians in particular, emphasize the need for government to stay out of our lives. And thinkers on the left often point out that if people are just leaving you alone, you might be unlimited in terms of choices, but you\u2019re not actually going to be able to do anything unless you have resources. So the idea is that if people have a platform to build their lives off, they have resources every month. They can actually do things. They can meet their needs. They can pursue various projects.\nOn the right side of the political spectrum, people see UBI as potentially realizing a number of goals. One, they emphasize this is anti-paternalistic in nature. There\u2019s an element of government not interfering with the lives of individuals by imposing all these conditionalities on them, but rather just letting them be free to live their lives as they see fit with the income.\nThe other thing that folks on the right emphasize is the way UBI might allow you to shrink the size of government. People on the left often think of basic income as something we\u2019re going to add to the safety net and keep much of the safety net intact. People on the right often see it as a replacement: We\u2019re going to give people a guaranteed income, and we\u2019re going to get rid of a whole host of social safety net programs that cost a lot of money and require a lot of people to administer.\nWendt: One thing I found interesting about Andrew Yang\u2019s proposal was his idea to let people choose whether they either take the UBI or keep the benefits from current programs.\nAnother thing different proponents will disagree upon is how high UBI should be. A thousand dollars a month was Yang\u2019s proposal, but you could also go much lower or much higher. Maybe even \u201cas high as is sustainable,\u201d as [Belgian philosopher and economist and chief UBI proponent Philippe] Van Parijs would say.\nIts sustainability will depend on how high it is pitched, but also on how it\u2019s financed. It seems very natural to think that it would be financed through the income tax. That would make it a close relative to a negative income tax proposal, which was popular in the 1960s and \u201970s. [The influential American economist] Milton Friedman was a famous advocate of that. But Andrew Yang and others propose a mix in terms of how it\u2019s financed. It could also be a sales tax or capital income tax or some other way.\nWendt: UBI has often been seen as a response to the challenge of automation \u2014 the worry that many people are going to become unemployed and replaced by machines. For example, truck drivers will lose their jobs once there are automated trucks. In the end, that\u2019s not a new concern, though. People have worried that machines would replace jobs at least since the 19th century, but usually new types of jobs were always created elsewhere.\nThe idea of a UBI was brought up last spring as a response to the pandemic \u2014 an emergency UBI. The coronavirus hit so hard. Many people felt like this was a chance to get some serious reform of the welfare state going. In the end we got the stimulus checks instead, which were not completely different, but a one-time thing, and not unconditional. The checks depended on how much you earned.\nOne thing to emphasize is also how UBI would empower women. It gives working mothers cash to pay for childcare, for example, or it makes it easier to leave an abusive husband if you have something to rely on that is independent from the family situation.\nMacKay: The other thing I would point to are concerns about income inequality. I don\u2019t think this is necessarily a great solution to the problem of income inequality, but I think the economic anxiety leads people to UBI.\nMacKay: There\u2019s been a variety of studies. There were a couple of really famous experiments in the \u201970s in Canada and here in the United States. There was a really interesting study in Manitoba in the late \u201970s, where they had a whole town that was subject to a guaranteed income policy \u2014 a floor that families would not fall below. A lot of randomized controlled trials in low-income countries have been using cash transfers since the late \u201980s, early \u201990s. Some of these are conditional cash transfers. In Mexico, for example, you might get a cash transfer from the government if you send your kids to school and take them for yearly doctor visits. And there was one recently in Finland, where they gave $500 per month to unemployed folks.\nThese are high-quality studies. The evidence has shown that the UBI programs are pretty effective in a number of different ways. The caveat I would give is that they happen in different contexts, and the interventions are very different.\nWendt: An experiment in Kenya is the largest. It involves around 20,000 people and unconditional cash payments that cover basic needs. It started in 2017 and will last 12 years. There are four different groups. One group gets the cash for the whole 12 years. Another group gets paid up front rather than on a monthly basis, I believe. Another group receives payments for a shorter period of time. And then there\u2019s a control group that doesn\u2019t get any cash. Some people reported that it has changed how women see their role in the household, because they felt entitled to have a say over how to spend the money.\nMacKay: A big one is a reciprocity worry \u2014 that in order to get access to public benefits, you should be at least willing to participate in the labor market.\nThink of the earned-income tax credit. That\u2019s a cash transfer that goes to low-income Americans. But to get access to it, you need to be participating in the labor force. A lot of programs like SNAP [the federal government\u2019s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as the Food Stamp Program] and TANF [Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, another federal program] have work requirements attached to them. The Trump administration was trying to attach a work requirement to Medicaid programs, as well. The thought is, you should only get access to public benefits if you are participating in the formal labor market and earning an income.\nThe question they ask is: Why should some group of individuals be participating in the labor force and paying taxes to fund a UBI for other people who aren\u2019t participating in the labor market? One of the responses to this is that UBI recognizes all those forms of contribution to society that aren\u2019t remunerated. Think about parents taking care of their children or poor people taking care of elderly family members. There\u2019s lots of ways in which people contribute to society. And you can think of a UBI as reciprocating in that sense, remunerating people for those contributions.\nWendt: Another common worry is that UBI is a waste of money on the wealthy. Why should all of those wealthy people get a monthly check? If the goal is to do something about poverty, then why UBI, since the rich by definition are not poor? That\u2019s an understandable concern for sure. But the reply there is that depending on how the UBI is financed, the rich will not be net beneficiaries. They will contribute more to finance the UBI than what they get as their monthly check.\nMacKay: This is the first time I\u2019ve heard of a guaranteed income program that\u2019s aimed at people coming out of prison. I think it makes perfect sense. Part of the justification here is that people with a felony record face a lot of difficulty in terms of accessing other public programs. I think they\u2019re actually banned for at least some period of time from federal housing programs and from receiving SNAP benefits. Felons face a lot of difficulty getting jobs. Employers can legitimately ask if they have a record and deny them employment on that basis. So it makes a lot of sense that you would target this type of pilot project at those folks. If you think about who needs a platform in American society, it\u2019s going to be people who don\u2019t have access to these other programs and are economically vulnerable in terms of not being able to get a job. And so I think it makes a lot of sense that you would target the program this way.\nOftentimes we discuss UBI as a major transformation to society, as a sort of utopian policy. That draws a lot of attention. But I think the discussion might lead to a simpler idea \u2014 just using cash payments in more of our social safety net programs. That might be more sustainable, more cost effective, than trying to try to implement a full UBI type policy. For that reason, what\u2019s happening in Durham \u2014 a guaranteed income for a very narrow group of individuals \u2014 is really interesting.\nOne thing the pandemic has shown us is that the government got a little bit more comfortable with giving cash payments to people. Another thing I\u2019m really excited about are these proposals to expand the child tax credit, both coming from [Mitt] Romney and also coming from the Democrats, which you might think of as a basic income for kids. Every month, they would get a certain amount of money, maybe a few hundred dollars. The parents decide how to spend it, but the thought is it\u2019s kind of like a baseline for kids. We don\u2019t want to spend too much time focusing on the big UBI utopian policy proposals and miss that there\u2019s a lot of interesting and potentially really important, cost-effective policy proposals around using cash payments in very targeted ways.\nBy Logan Ward, The Well", "source_raw_text": "Unconditional cash payments to residents are more of a floor to stand on than a safety net, say these Carolina scholars in light of a proposed pilot project to give $500 per month to formerly incarcerated Durham, North Carolina, residents.

means testing has been accompanied by a narrative of \u2018scroungers and skivers\u2019, a presumption that there are large numbers of people trying to game the system, and a drive to reduce claimant numbers.", "\nSome advocates also argue that UBI could improve work incentives, if it was either not withdrawn at all as people earned more or was withdrawn at a lower rate than in the current benefit system.", "(Although others worry that the incentive to enter work at all might be reduced if people could rely on a high enough income outside it, discussed further below).", "\nAlongside problems in our social security system, many advocates also see UBI as a response to increasing insecurity in our labour market.", "Too often low-paid jobs are unpredictable and insecure.", "Workers don\u2019t know what shifts or hours they will be working from one week to the next or how long the job will last.", "People cycle in and out of low-paid, temporary jobs, never able to rely on a steady income.", "UBI could provide a fixed income stream to offset this earnings volatility.", "In addition, some argue that UBI would free people to choose whether to take paid work or care for others, train or do other activities, and would recognise the value to society of such activities.", "In this scenario, it might bring wider benefits through better job matches and people holding out for better quality work, creating pressure on employers to pay more and achieve greater productivity.", "There are also wider debates about the extent to which automation may lead to significantly fewer jobs or climate change may necessitate such major economic changes that there will be a new norms of people doing much less paid work.", "For some, UBI is a necessary accompaniment to such radical economic changes.", "\nFinally, there are a range of other arguments put forward for UBI which do not relate to poverty, social security or labour market insecurity, such as the idea it would reduce the level of state involvement in people\u2019s lives.", "In this piece, we focus on the arguments relating to poverty and insecurity.", "There are, of course, versions of UBI which would significantly increase poverty by reducing the support provided to those on low incomes, but we assume these would not be proposed by those aiming to reduce poverty.", "\nMost UBI proposals now include two features, in contrast to some earlier proposals which intended to replace all benefits with UBI or introduce UBI without accompanying tax changes.", "Alongside flat payments, there would continue to be a system of benefits linked to costs.", "A system of flat payments alone could not offer adequate support with varying costs of housing, childcare or disability.", "This means that there would continue to be a degree of complexity and means-testing even if UBI was introduced (sometimes known as UBI+ ), and that efforts to improve the existing system must continue.", "Second, UBI would replace parts of the tax system as well as social security.", "Most likely, the tax-free personal allowance would be removed, so people would pay tax on the entirety of their earned income.", "Depending on the design, many on lower- to middle-incomes would more than recoup this in the universal payment.", "\nA key design question is obviously the level at which UBI is set.", "Would it be based below, at, or just above current benefit levels?", "Or provide much higher payments, for instance at the level of JRF\u2019s Minimum Income Standard?", "*", "This would be the main determinant of both the cost of UBI and its immediate impact on poverty levels.", "\nA recent study by the Fraser of Allander Institute, Manchester Metropolitan University and IPPR Scotland, examined the costs and benefits of a Citizen\u2019s Basic Income in Scotland at current benefit or at Minimum Income Standard level.", "These costs relate to introducing the scheme in Scotland; those for a UK-wide version would be much higher.", "However, estimates of necessary tax rate increases would be similar whether in Scotland or across the whole country.", "\nA UBI based on current benefit levels would bring clear gains for those who are currently ineligible, where they are on a low income but are shut out, or fall out, of the existing system; it would probably bring smaller gains for many of those successfully claiming current benefits.", "Fraser of Allander et al estimates the costs and impacts of introducing this kind of UBI in Scotland.", "This scheme would require \u00a37 billion in net additional funding (after existing benefits have been reduced and the tax-free personal allowance eliminated), paid for by increasing all tax rates by eight percentage points.", "UBI at this level would deliver lower levels of poverty and greater income security (reducing the number of people in poverty in Scotland by a quarter and child poverty by a third).", "However, it seems unlikely to achieve wider goals of significantly reducing insecurity and allowing more people to choose whether to care, train, or hold out for better jobs.", "\nIntroducing a higher level of UBI, for instance at Minimum Income Standard level , would potentially achieve these benefits and almost eradicate poverty in Scotland, but would be extremely expensive.", "Fraser of Allander et al estimates this would require \u00a338 billion in net additional funding (again, after existing benefits have been reduced and the tax-free personal allowance eliminated).", "If funded through income tax it would require tax rates to start at 58p for the first \u00a31 earned and rise to 85p for the higher and top rates.", "The Minimum Income Standard is significantly higher than the poverty line.", "An alternative would be to set UBI rates at or around the poverty line.", "This would be less costly than a version based on the Minimum Income Standard but still very expensive.", "\nThe specific design of UBI significantly impacts the distribution of winners and losers, and increases or decreases in poverty amongst different groups.", "Some proposals result in higher poverty for some groups than under the current social security system.", "One version with UBI payments based mainly on current benefit levels (funded by increasing tax rates by three percentage points and abolishing the tax-free personal allowance and National Insurance thresholds) would reduce poverty overall but lead to higher poverty rates for children and lone parents.", "Around 20% of people in the poorest fifth would lose more than 5% of their income (despite the scheme being highly redistributive overall).", "\nOther proposals avoid big losses for people on low incomes.", "Malcolm Torry proposed a UBI payment of \u00a360 per week, funded by raising the basic, higher and top rates of tax by two, three and four percentage points respectively (and substantially reducing \u2013 though not eliminating - the tax-free personal allowance and National Insurance threshold).", "This reduces the number of people in poverty by 16% and children in poverty by 13%, while fewer than 2% of the poorest fifth of households lose more than 5% of their income.", "Compass proposed a scheme that reduces working-age poverty by a fifth and child poverty by a third, with only around 1% of people in the bottom fifth losing more than 5% of their income.", "It raises existing tax rates by three percentage points, abolishes the tax-free personal allowance and National Insurance thresholds, and introduces a starter tax rate of 15% on the first \u00a311,850 of earnings.", "However, that leaves a funding gap of \u00a328 billion.", "\nThese models provide only illustrative examples of how UBI might be funded by income tax.", "In reality, such radical changes might require a more balanced tax response (such as wealth or carbon taxes) but there is no doubt that significant tax rises would be necessary.", "\nWould giving people an income regardless of work lead to many more people deciding not to take paid employment, valuing the unpaid work of carers and contributions to society other than paid jobs?", "If so, would that damage or improve our economy and society?", "Alternatively, UBI could increase work incentives by reducing the rate at which income from it was reduced as someone earned more.", "For example, Universal Credit is reduced by 63p in every pound earned above a set level; under some versions of UBI this would change to someone losing only 20p for every pound earned.", "\nEconomic models estimate employment effects purely through a financial lens.", "Work incentives are calculated according to the net financial gain from taking a job or increasing earnings.", "Most modelling suggests that UBI (accompanied by higher taxes on earnings to pay for it) would have a complex mix of impacts.", "Some groups see increased work incentives because their benefits are reduced by less as they move into work or earn more.", "Others have lower work incentives due to unearned income and higher tax rates.", "Under the version of UBI modelled by Fraser of Allander et al, the overall result was that UBI reduced financial incentives to work and so could lead to a lower labour supply and a smaller economy.", "By contrast, Martinelli and Pearce found that several UBI schemes strengthened work incentives on average for low- and middle-income households.", "\nA change on the scale of UBI would be likely to affect other aspects of our economy, for instance how wages were set.", "It is hard to predict how individuals and businesses might react to such changes.", "In addition, in the real world we don\u2019t make decisions purely on the basis assumed in economic modelling.", "There is limited evidence about how people respond to UBI in practice.", "So far, trials suggest that providing an unconditional payment may not have the negative employment effects found in some modelling.", "Finland is the only country to have carried out a nationwide, randomised control trial of UBI.", "The evaluation found that people receiving basic income were more likely to be in work than those in the control group.", "This is not conclusive, due to the introduction of other unemployment policies at the same time, although the signs from other smaller trials have also been positive, such as those in Stockton (USA) and the Netherlands .", "However, these trials have not examined the potential employment effects of changes to tax rates or other measures to fund such a system.", "\nOne of the potential benefits of UBI is the removal of stress caused by means-tests, conditionality and uncertainty about whether support will be withdrawn, coupled with destigmatisation of social security support.", "This could lead to better mental and physical health.", "It is easy to see the well-being advantages of a system providing a reliable income, uncoupled from complex conditions, shorn of the fear of failing and the feeling of being seen as a scrounger or having to continually prove your eligibility.", "The limited evidence from trials backs up this theory.", "In Finland, people on basic income reported higher life satisfaction, better health and lower levels of depression and loneliness.", "\nSome versions of UBI could reduce poverty and improve recipients\u2019 mental health and well-being.", "But it would be expensive.", "It would require significant increases in tax rates, which people may be reluctant to accept, even if many of those on low- to middle-incomes would be better off overall once receipt of their UBI payment is accounted for.", "The principle of offering payments without conditions might well also meet resistance among the public.", "\nPublic attitudes towards welfare have been softening in recent years , with increasing support for raising benefit levels.", "There has also been rising willingness to pay more tax to fund more public spending.", "However, when asked what kind of public spending additional taxes should be spent on , very few people prioritise social security.", "When asked directly about UBI, some studies show a sizeable minority of the public are receptive to the idea, at least of a pilot, but with no majority in favour and significant concerns about cost and use of the money, even among supporters; other studies suggest around half may be in favour.", "JRF polling in Scotland found a majority in favour of the Minimum Income Guarantee and significant minorities receptive to the idea of UBI, but no majority for that, or for increasing unemployment benefits.", "Willingness to personally pay more tax to fund UBI may well also be much lower than such polling implies.", "YouGov polling in 2020 examined whether the British public would be willing to pay more in tax to deal with the costs of the pandemic.", "It found that the public did support tax rises, but not for themselves.", "Only a quarter would back a

designed to reduce poverty, improve income security and boost well-being, but could be expensive and challenging to introduce. Many of its goals could be achieved through changes to the existing social security system and addressing the underlying causes of insecurity in the labour and housing markets.\nUniversal Basic Income (UBI, Citizens\u2019 Basic Income \u2013 CBI, or simply Basic Income) is an idea whose time appears to have come. The Welsh Government has committed to trialling it, the Scottish Government has invested in the feasibility of pilots, several English cities are keen to test it out and a number of political parties included UBI trials in their manifestos. But is it really the right basis on which to build a post-pandemic society? What problems is it trying to solve? Is it the only or the best solution to those issues?\nThere are many models but at its heart it is a regular cash payment every individual receives, without any reference to their other income or wealth and without any conditions. Payment amounts can vary according to broad demographic characteristics, such as a different payment for working-age adults, children and pensioners.\nIt is important to distinguish UBI from a Minimum Income Guarantee, which at its most basic is simply a set of policies designed to ensure no one falls below a set income level.\nSome argue that Universal Basic Income is part of a radical rethinking of our economy and society, that provides a level of economic security to everyone and destigmatises the social security system. It is also seen as a potential solution to insecurity in the labour market.\nThe social security problems which UBI could help to address include -\n- Coverage. Too many people locked out of the support they need, due to:\nPolicy design - for example, deficiencies in maternity and paternity pay, support whilst training, and low-earning workers without Statutory Sick Pay.\nNon-take up - due to stigma, lack of awareness, mistakes, the difficulty or unpleasantness of the system.\nDropping out of the system - because of conditions or treatment.\nSanctions - losing part or all of your benefits because you are deemed not to have met the conditions of receipt.\nDelays, errors and problems with benefits - which can result in people having to go for long periods of time with little or no income.\n- Adequacy. High poverty rates for some groups even when they receive social security and are meeting work or activity requirements, demonstrate its current inadequacy. Official food insecurity statistics show 4 in 10 Universal Credit claimants can\u2019t even afford food. Providing a high enough universal payment could ensure everyone has the resources to meet basic standards of living, preventing poverty or destitution.\n- Uncertainty. Many people, particularly those on low incomes, emphasise the importance of having predictable and stable payments. Yet people often experience variable and unpredictable fluctuations in benefit payments.\n- Complexity. Any system which tailors support to individual circumstances will entail some complexity. Introducing ever more means-testing and conditions attached to various benefits requires more complex systems and processes.\n- Dignity, respect and well-being. Not all benefit claimants experience problems or feel they are treated poorly. But some find the culture of our social security system suspicious, disrespectful and undignified. There is evidence of the negative impact of these experiences on people\u2019s mental health. Over many years, the ramping up of conditionality and means testing has been accompanied by a narrative of \u2018scroungers and skivers\u2019, a presumption that there are large numbers of people trying to game the system, and a drive to reduce claimant numbers.\nSome advocates also argue that UBI could improve work incentives, if it was either not withdrawn at all as people earned more or was withdrawn at a lower rate than in the current benefit system. (Although others worry that the incentive to enter work at all might be reduced if people could rely on a high enough income outside it, discussed further below).\nAlongside problems in our social security system, many advocates also see UBI as a response to increasing insecurity in our labour market. Too often low-paid jobs are unpredictable and insecure. Workers don\u2019t know what shifts or hours they will be working from one week to the next or how long the job will last. People cycle in and out of low-paid, temporary jobs, never able to rely on a steady income. UBI could provide a fixed income stream to offset this earnings volatility. In addition, some argue that UBI would free people to choose whether to take paid work or care for others, train or do other activities, and would recognise the value to society of such activities. In this scenario, it might bring wider benefits through better job matches and people holding out for better quality work, creating pressure on employers to pay more and achieve greater productivity. There are also wider debates about the extent to which automation may lead to significantly fewer jobs or climate change may necessitate such major economic changes that there will be a new norms of people doing much less paid work. For some, UBI is a necessary accompaniment to such radical economic changes.\nFinally, there are a range of other arguments put forward for UBI which do not relate to poverty, social security or labour market insecurity, such as the idea it would reduce the level of state involvement in people\u2019s lives. In this piece, we focus on the arguments relating to poverty and insecurity. There are, of course, versions of UBI which would significantly increase poverty by reducing the support provided to those on low incomes, but we assume these would not be proposed by those aiming to reduce poverty.\nMost UBI proposals now include two features, in contrast to some earlier proposals which intended to replace all benefits with UBI or introduce UBI without accompanying tax changes. Alongside flat payments, there would continue to be a system of benefits linked to costs. A system of flat payments alone could not offer adequate support with varying costs of housing, childcare or disability. This means that there would continue to be a degree of complexity and means-testing even if UBI was introduced (sometimes known as UBI+ ), and that efforts to improve the existing system must continue. Second, UBI would replace parts of the tax system as well as social security. Most likely, the tax-free personal allowance would be removed, so people would pay tax on the entirety of their earned income. Depending on the design, many on lower- to middle-incomes would more than recoup this in the universal payment.\nA key design question is obviously the level at which UBI is set. Would it be based below, at, or just above current benefit levels? Or provide much higher payments, for instance at the level of JRF\u2019s Minimum Income Standard?* This would be the main determinant of both the cost of UBI and its immediate impact on poverty levels.\nA recent study by the Fraser of Allander Institute, Manchester Metropolitan University and IPPR Scotland, examined the costs and benefits of a Citizen\u2019s Basic Income in Scotland at current benefit or at Minimum Income Standard level. These costs relate to introducing the scheme in Scotland; those for a UK-wide version would be much higher. However, estimates of necessary tax rate increases would be similar whether in Scotland or across the whole country.\nA UBI based on current benefit levels would bring clear gains for those who are currently ineligible, where they are on a low income but are shut out, or fall out, of the existing system; it would probably bring smaller gains for many of those successfully claiming current benefits. Fraser of Allander et al estimates the costs and impacts of introducing this kind of UBI in Scotland. This scheme would require \u00a37 billion in net additional funding (after existing benefits have been reduced and the tax-free personal allowance eliminated), paid for by increasing all tax rates by eight percentage points. UBI at this level would deliver lower levels of poverty and greater income security (reducing the number of people in poverty in Scotland by a quarter and child poverty by a third). However, it seems unlikely to achieve wider goals of significantly reducing insecurity and allowing more people to choose whether to care, train, or hold out for better jobs.\nIntroducing a higher level of UBI, for instance at Minimum Income Standard level , would potentially achieve these benefits and almost eradicate poverty in Scotland, but would be extremely expensive. Fraser of Allander et al estimates this would require \u00a338 billion in net additional funding (again, after existing benefits have been reduced and the tax-free personal allowance eliminated). If funded through income tax it would require tax rates to start at 58p for the first \u00a31 earned and rise to 85p for the higher and top rates. The Minimum Income Standard is significantly higher than the poverty line. An alternative would be to set UBI rates at or around the poverty line. This would be less costly than a version based on the Minimum Income Standard but still very expensive.\nThe specific design of UBI significantly impacts the distribution of winners and losers, and increases or decreases in poverty amongst different groups. Some proposals result in higher poverty for some groups than under the current social security system. One version with UBI payments based mainly on current benefit levels (funded by increasing tax rates by three percentage points and abolishing the tax-free personal allowance and National Insurance thresholds) would reduce poverty overall but lead to higher poverty rates for children and lone parents. Around 20% of people in the poorest fifth would lose more than 5% of their income (despite the scheme being highly redistributive overall).\nOther proposals avoid big losses for people on low incomes. Malcolm Torry proposed a UBI payment of \u00a360 per week, funded by raising the basic, higher and top rates of tax by two, three and four percentage points respectively (and substantially reducing \u2013 though not eliminating - the tax-free personal allowance and National Insurance threshold). This reduces the number of people in poverty by 16% and children in poverty by 13%, while fewer than 2% of the poorest fifth of households lose more than 5% of their income. Compass proposed a scheme that reduces working-age poverty by a fifth and child poverty by a third, with only around 1% of people in the bottom fifth losing more than 5% of their income. It raises existing tax rates by three percentage points, abolishes the tax-free personal allowance and National Insurance thresholds, and introduces a starter tax rate of 15% on the first \u00a311,850 of earnings. However, that leaves a funding gap of \u00a328 billion.\nThese models provide only illustrative examples of how UBI might be funded by income tax. In reality, such radical changes might require a more balanced tax response (such as wealth or carbon taxes) but there is no doubt that significant tax rises would be necessary.\nWould giving people an income regardless of work lead to many more people deciding not to take paid employment, valuing the unpaid work of carers and contributions to society other than paid jobs? If so, would that damage or improve our economy and society? Alternatively, UBI could increase work incentives by reducing the rate at which income from it was reduced as someone earned more. For example, Universal Credit is reduced by 63p in every pound earned above a set level; under some versions of UBI this would change to someone losing only 20p for every pound earned.\nEconomic models estimate employment effects purely through a financial lens. Work incentives are calculated according to the net financial gain from taking a job or increasing earnings. Most modelling suggests that UBI (accompanied by higher taxes on earnings to pay for it) would have a complex mix of impacts. Some groups see increased work incentives because their benefits are reduced by less as they move into work or earn more. Others have lower work incentives due to unearned income and higher tax rates. Under the version of UBI modelled by Fraser of Allander et al, the overall result was that UBI reduced financial incentives to work and so could lead to a lower labour supply and a smaller economy. By contrast, Martinelli and Pearce found that several UBI schemes strengthened work incentives on average for low- and middle-income households.\nA change on the scale of UBI would be likely to affect other aspects of our economy, for instance how wages were set. It is hard to predict how individuals and businesses might react to such changes. In addition, in the real world we don\u2019t make decisions purely on the basis assumed in economic modelling. There is limited evidence about how people respond to UBI in practice. So far, trials suggest that providing an unconditional payment may not have the negative employment effects found in some modelling. Finland is the only country to have carried out a nationwide, randomised control trial of UBI. The evaluation found that people receiving basic income were more likely to be in work than those in the control group. This is not conclusive, due to the introduction of other unemployment policies at the same time, although the signs from other smaller trials have also been positive, such as those in Stockton (USA) and the Netherlands . However, these trials have not examined the potential employment effects of changes to tax rates or other measures to fund such a system.\nOne of the potential benefits of UBI is the removal of stress caused by means-tests, conditionality and uncertainty about whether support will be withdrawn, coupled with destigmatisation of social security support. This could lead to better mental and physical health. It is easy to see the well-being advantages of a system providing a reliable income, uncoupled from complex conditions, shorn of the fear of failing and the feeling of being seen as a scrounger or having to continually prove your eligibility. The limited evidence from trials backs up this theory. In Finland, people on basic income reported higher life satisfaction, better health and lower levels of depression and loneliness.\nSome versions of UBI could reduce poverty and improve recipients\u2019 mental health and well-being. But it would be expensive. It would require significant increases in tax rates, which people may be reluctant to accept, even if many of those on low- to middle-incomes would be better off overall once receipt of their UBI payment is accounted for. The principle of offering payments without conditions might well also meet resistance among the public.\nPublic attitudes towards welfare have been softening in recent years , with increasing support for raising benefit levels. There has also been rising willingness to pay more tax to fund more public spending. However, when asked what kind of public spending additional taxes should be spent on , very few people prioritise social security. When asked directly about UBI, some studies show a sizeable minority of the public are receptive to the idea, at least of a pilot, but with no majority in favour and significant concerns about cost and use of the money, even among supporters; other studies suggest around half may be in favour. JRF polling in Scotland found a majority in favour of the Minimum Income Guarantee and significant minorities receptive to the idea of UBI, but no majority for that, or for increasing unemployment benefits. Willingness to personally pay more tax to fund UBI may well also be much lower than such polling implies. YouGov polling in 2020 examined whether the British public would be willing to pay more in tax to deal with the costs of the pandemic. It found that the public did support tax rises, but not for themselves. Only a quarter would back a tax rise that affected everyone.\nA second barrier to introducing UBI nationally is the potential complexity and disruption of introducing large-scale changes to the social security and tax systems. The roll-out of Universal Credit has shown just how challenging such a change can be, for claimants, staff and civil society. Many of those who rely on social security feel extremely fearful about transferring from one benefit to another, or from one system to another. The extent of potential disruption does depend on the details of the scheme. The addition of a small simple new universal payment while maintaining the rest of the existing benefit system around it might be less challenging.\nIt is undoubtedly true that our social security system is failing to protect people from destitution and hardship. We need better coverage and to invest more in the system. But a multitude of changes to the existing system would go a long way to achieving those goals, without the expense and disruption of a new system. We could remove the benefit cap, the two-child limit and the five-week wait; extend sick pay to all; boost support for those at most risk of poverty; run national take up campaigns and reform council tax. A range of other measures, such as these , could be taken to fulfil other goals or principles of UBI. None of these individual changes would eradicate poverty, as a generous UBI system would. They would all require money and political will. But pursuing such improvements could transform the system for a fraction of the cost and difficulty of that kind associated with UBI.\nOur current system fails to ensure that all those within it are treated with dignity and respect. It causes unnecessary and harmful stress for too many people and the sanctions regime is unnecessarily punitive. Again, however, we could roll back the complexity and harshness of conditionality and refocus the current system on maximising take up, valuing caring and supporting people to move into high-quality work.\nChanging the public and media narrative is necessary to achieving greater and more sustainable investment in our social security system, whether that is to improve the existing system or put a new UBI in place. The question is whether couching the debate in terms of introducing UBI will be more or less effective in building that support compared to focusing more specifically on the different elements that are needed, such as greater understanding of the purpose of social security, greater empathy for those relying on it, the need for adequate support and dignity.\nAnd what about the underlying issue of insecurity in work (and housing for that matter)? Our social security system needs to do more to counter the volatility in earned income that many low-earning workers face. For some, Universal Credit is exaggerating that volatility rather than counterbalancing it. This is a difficult policy challenge, but UBI is not the only way to solve it. Smaller changes could achieve significant improvements such as strengthening more universal elements of the system (like Child Benefit) and contributory benefits; more infrequent reassessments of eligibility for some benefits; run-ons when circumstances change, and disregard when incomes rise or fall by small amounts. Clearer incentives to move into work and increase earnings could be achieved by allowing people to earn more before they started to lose benefits and reducing the \u2018taper rate\u2019 so benefits reduce more slowly. All of these would require additional investment, so the argument about funding still needs to be won, but they would probably be less expensive and might be less challenging to achieve than UBI.\nAddressing insecurity also requires wider changes to our economy and society \u2013 no social security system can or should do the whole job. We must redesign the labour market to offer greater security as well as better pay, training and treatment at work. We need more low-cost rented homes and better rights for private sector renters so that people on low incomes can be freed from the constant fear of homelessness.\nUBI is not a silver bullet that would immediately and straightforwardly solve poverty.

If so, would that damage or improve our economy and society? Alternatively, UBI could increase work incentives by reducing the rate at which income from it was reduced as someone earned more. For example, Universal Credit is reduced by 63p in every pound earned above a set level; under some versions of UBI this would change to someone losing only 20p for every pound earned. Economic models estimate employment effects purely through a financial lens. Work incentives are calculated according to the net financial gain from taking a job or increasing earnings. Most modelling suggests that UBI (accompanied by higher taxes on earnings to pay for it) would have a complex mix of impacts. Some groups see increased work incentives because their benefits are reduced by less as they move into work or earn more. Others have lower work incentives due to unearned income and higher tax rates. Under the version of UBI modelled by Fraser of Allander et al, the overall result was that UBI reduced financial incentives to work and so could lead to a lower labour supply and a smaller economy. By contrast, Martinelli and Pearce found that several UBI schemes strengthened work incentives on average for low- and middle-income households. A change on the scale of UBI would be likely to affect other aspects of our economy, for instance how wages were set. It is hard to predict how individuals and businesses might react to such changes. In addition, in the real world we don\u2019t make decisions purely on the basis assumed in economic modelling. There is limited evidence about how people respond to UBI in practice. So far, trials suggest that providing an unconditional payment may not have the negative employment effects found in some modelling. Finland is the only country to have carried out a nationwide, randomised control trial of UBI. The evaluation found that people receiving basic income were more likely to be in work than those in the control group. This is not conclusive, due to the introduction of other unemployment policies at the same time, although the signs from other smaller trials have also been positive, such as those in Stockton (USA) and the Netherlands . However, these trials have not examined the potential employment effects of changes to tax rates or other measures to fund such a system. One of the potential benefits of UBI is the removal of stress caused by means-tests, conditionality and uncertainty about whether support will be withdrawn, coupled with destigmatisation of social security support. This could lead to better mental and physical health. It is easy to see the well-being advantages of a system providing a reliable income, uncoupled from complex conditions, shorn of the fear of failing and the feeling of being seen as a scrounger or having to continually prove your eligibility. The limited evidence from trials backs up this theory. In Finland, people on basic income reported higher life satisfaction, better health and lower levels of depression and loneliness. Some versions of UBI could reduce poverty and improve recipients\u2019 mental health and well-being. But it would be expensive. It would require significant increases in tax rates, which people may be reluctant to accept, even if many of those on low- to middle-incomes would be better off overall once receipt of their UBI payment is accounted for. The principle of offering payments without conditions might well also meet resistance among the public. Public attitudes towards welfare have been softening in recent years , with increasing support for raising benefit levels. There has also been rising willingness to pay more tax to fund more public spending. However, when asked what kind of public spending additional taxes should be spent on , very few people prioritise social security. When asked directly about UBI, some studies show a sizeable minority of the public are receptive to the idea, at least of a pilot, but with no majority in favour and significant concerns about cost and use of the money, even among supporters; other studies suggest around half may be in favour. JRF polling in Scotland found a majority in favour of the Minimum Income Guarantee and significant minorities receptive to the idea of UBI, but no majority for that, or for increasing unemployment benefits. Willingness to personally pay more tax to fund UBI may well also be much lower than such polling implies. YouGov polling in 2020 examined whether the British public would be willing to pay more in tax to deal with the costs of the pandemic. It found that the public did support tax rises, but not for themselves. Only a quarter would back a tax rise that affected everyone. A second barrier to introducing UBI nationally is the potential complexity and disruption of introducing large-scale changes to the social security and tax systems. The roll-out of Universal Credit has shown just how challenging such a change can be, for claimants, staff and civil society. Many of those who rely on social security feel extremely fearful about transferring from one benefit to another, or from one system to another. The extent of potential disruption does depend on the details of the scheme. The addition of a small simple new universal payment while maintaining the rest of the existing benefit system around it might be less challenging. It is undoubtedly true that our social security system is failing to protect people from destitution and hardship. We need better coverage and to invest more in the system. But a multitude of changes to the existing system would go a long way to achieving those goals, without the expense and disruption of a new system. We could remove the benefit cap, the two-child limit and the five-week wait; extend sick pay to all; boost support for those at most risk of poverty; run national take up campaigns and reform council tax. A range of other measures, such as these , could be taken to fulfil other goals or principles of UBI. None of these individual changes would eradicate poverty, as a generous UBI system would. They would all require money and political will. But pursuing such improvements could transform the system for a fraction of the cost and difficulty of that kind associated with UBI. Our current system fails to ensure that all those within it are treated with dignity and respect. It causes unnecessary and harmful stress for too many people and the sanctions regime is unnecessarily punitive. Again, however, we could roll back the complexity and harshness of conditionality and refocus the current system on maximising take up, valuing caring and supporting people to move into high-quality work. Changing the public and media narrative is necessary to achieving greater and more sustainable investment in our social security system, whether that is to improve the existing system or put a new UBI in place. The question is whether couching the debate in terms of introducing UBI will be more or less effective in building that support compared to focusing more specifically on the different elements that are needed, such as greater understanding of the purpose of social security, greater empathy for those relying on it, the need for adequate support and dignity. And what about the underlying issue of insecurity in work (and housing for that matter)? Our social security system needs to do more to counter the volatility in earned income that many low-earning workers face. For some, Universal Credit is exaggerating that volatility rather than counterbalancing it. This is a difficult policy challenge, but UBI is not the only way to solve it. Smaller changes could achieve significant improvements such as strengthening more universal elements of the system (like Child Benefit) and contributory benefits; more infrequent reassessments of eligibility for some benefits; run-ons when circumstances change, and disregard when incomes rise or fall by small amounts. Clearer incentives to move into work and increase earnings could be achieved by allowing people to earn more before they started to lose benefits and reducing the \u2018taper rate\u2019 so benefits reduce more slowly. All of these would require additional investment, so the argument about funding still needs to be won, but they would probably be less expensive and might be less challenging to achieve than UBI. Addressing insecurity also requires wider changes to our economy and society \u2013 no social security system can or should do the whole job. We must redesign the labour market to offer greater security as well as better pay, training and treatment at work. We need more low-cost rented homes and better rights for private sector renters so that people on low incomes can be freed from the constant fear of homelessness. UBI is not a silver bullet that would immediately and straightforwardly solve poverty. It could not replace the whole social security system. It is beyond doubt that a UBI that radically reduced poverty levels would require enormous increases in public spending and be a very significant redistribution across society. A smaller, less radical but potentially more immediately achievable, partial UBI payment could achieve some valuable outcomes but would fall short of some of the bigger aims of UBI. There are more targeted ways of achieving similar outcomes, although these might not bring some of the wider impacts of a very generous UBI. The debate about ambitious interventions to reduce poverty is welcome, underlining the growing consensus that the current social security system is inadequate and does not provide the effective public service we need to protect people from poverty. A social security system that provides adequate support, reduces poverty and removes the indignities and stigma associated with the present system is a vital part of ending the injustice of poverty in the UK. A Minimum Income Guarantee could provide a positive framework within which to make progress. Whatever form it takes, it will require significant investment, for which we must build public support. *The Minimum Income Standard (MIS) is funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and carried out by Loughborough University.

AFP provides dividends to permanent residents of the state. The amount varies each year based on the stock market and other factors, and has ranged from $331.29 (1984) to $2,072 (2015). The payout for 2020 was $992.00, the smallest check received since 2013. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ]\nUBI has been in American news mostly thanks to the 2020 presidential campaign of Andrew Yang whose continued promotion of a UBI resulted in the formation of a nonprofit, Humanity Forward. [ 53 ]\nPro 1\nUniversal Basic Income (UBI) reduces poverty and income inequality, and improves physical and mental health.\nScott Santens, Founding Member of the Economic Security Project, says that a UBI set at $1,000 per adult per month and $300 per child per month would eradicate US poverty entirely. [ 12 ]\nThe poverty level in Brazil has fallen to the lowest level in 40 years after $100 a month has been distributed to about 25% of the population beginning in Mar. 2020. [ 51 ]\nNamibia\u2019s UBI program, the Basic Income Grant (trialled in 2007-2012), reduced household poverty rates from 76% of residents before the trial started to 37% after one year. Child malnutrition rates also fell from 42% to 17% in six months. [ 7 ]\nParticipants in India\u2019s UBI trial (2013-2014) said that UBIs helped improve their health by enabling them to afford medicine, improve sanitation, gain access to clean water, eat more regularly, and reduce their anxiety levels. [ 14 ]\nMincome, a trial UBI in Manitoba, Canada, in the mid-1970s, found that hospitalizations for accidents, injuries, and mental health diagnoses declined during the trial. [ 1 ]\nKenya\u2019s ongoing UBI trial has reportedly led to increased happiness and life satisfaction, and to reduced stress and depression. [ 2 ]\nMatthew Smith, PhD, Professor in Health History at the University of Strathclyde, stated that UBI could improve a range of mental health concerns and stressful situations proven to deteriorate mental health: \u201cRecent research has linked the stress of poverty with inflammation in the brain\u2026 UBI could be set at a level to ensure that everyone\u2019s basic needs are met. This would reduce much of the stress faced by the working poor or families on benefits\u2026 UBI would also help people, usually women and children, to leave abusive relationships. Domestic abuse occurs more often in poorer households, where victims lack the financial means to escape. Similarly, UBI might prevent the negative childhood experiences believed to lead to mental illness and other problems later in life. These include experiencing violence or abuse, or having parents with mental health, substance abuse and legal problems. Behind these problems are often poverty, inequality and social isolation.\u201d [ 50 ]\nPro 2\nUBI leads to positive job growth and lower school dropout rates.\nThe guarantee of UBI protects people from sluggish wage growth, low wages, and the lack of job security caused by the effects of the growing gig economy such as Uber/Lyft driving and short-term contracts, as well as increased automation in the workplace. [ 42 ] [ 5 ] [ 10 ]\nResearchers from the Roosevelt Institute created three models for US implementation of UBI and found that under all scenarios, UBI would grow the economy by increasing output, employment, prices, and wages. [ 44 ] Since implementation of the Alaska Permanent Fund, the increased purchasing power of UBI recipients has resulted in 10,000 additional jobs for the state. [ 6 ]\nUBI would also give employees the financial security to leave a bad job, or wait until the good job comes along to (re)join the job market. People won\u2019t have to take an awful job just to pay the bills. [ 54 ]\nUBI also enables people to stay in school longer and participate in training to improve skills or learn a trade.\nUganda\u2019s UBI trial, the Youth Opportunities Program, enabled participants to invest in skills training as well as tools and materials, resulting in an increase of business assets by 57%, work hours by 17%, and earnings by 38%. [ 8 ]\nThe Canadian Mincome trial in the 1970\u2019s found that participants of the trial were more likely to complete high school than counterparts not involved in the trial. [ 1 ]\nThe Basic Income Grant trial in Namibia (2007-2012) enabled parents to afford school fees, buy school uniforms, and encourage attendance. As a result, school dropout rates fell from almost 40% in Nov. 2007 to 5% in June 2008 to almost 0% in Nov. 2008. [ 7 ]\nPro 3\nUBI guarantees income for non-working parents and caregivers, thus empowering important traditionally unpaid roles, especially for women.\nGuy Standing, PhD, Professor of Development Studies at the University of London (UK), says UBI makes all forms of work, including childcare and eldercare, \u201cequally deserving\u201d of payment. [ 25 ] In another article, Standing noted \u201cAlmost definitionally, a properly designed basic income system will reduce gender-based inequality, because on average the payment will represent a higher share of women\u2019s income.\u201d [ 56 ]\nA UBI also allows working parents to reduce their working hours in order to spend more time with their children or help with household chores. [ 26 ] [ 27 ]\nReviewing the UBI trial in India (2013-2014), SEWA Bharat (an organization related to women\u2019s employment) and UNICEF (a children\u2019s rights organization) concluded that \u201cwomen\u2019s empowerment was one of the more important outcomes of this experiment,\u201d noting that women receiving a UBI participated more in household decision making, and benefited from improved access to food, healthcare, and education. [ 14 ]\nThe Basic Income Grant Coalition trial UBI in Namibia (2007-2012) found that UBI \u201creduced the dependency of women on men for their survival\u201d and reduced the pressure to engage in transactional sex. [ 7 ]\nMincome, the Canadian UBI trial in the mid-1970s, found that emergency room visits as a result of domestic violence reduced during the period of the trial, possibly because of the reduction in income-inequality between women and men. [ 28 ]\nCon 1\nUniversal Basic Income (UBI) takes money from the poor and gives it to everyone, increasing poverty and depriving the poor of much needed targeted support.\nUniversal Basic Income (UBI) takes money from the poor and gives it to everyone, increasing poverty and depriving the poor of much needed targeted support.\nPeople experiencing poverty face a variety of hardships that are addressed with existing anti-poverty measures such as food stamps, medical aid, and child assistance programs. UBI programs often use funds from these targeted programs for distribution to everyone in society. [ 15 ]\nAccording to Robert Greenstein, President of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, \u201c[i]f you take the dollars targeted on people in the bottom fifth or two-fifths of the population and convert them to universal payments to people all the way up the income scale, you\u2019re redistributing income upward. That would increase poverty and inequality rather than reduce them.\u201d [ 15 ]\nLuke Martinelli, PhD, Research Associate at the University of Bath, created three models of UBI implementation and concluded that all three would lead to a significant number of individuals and households who are worse off. He noted that \u201cthese losses are not concentrated among richer groups; on the contrary, they are proportionally larger for the bottom three income quintiles.\u201d [ 37 ]\nResearch by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Finland, France, Italy, and the UK concluded that \u201crather than reducing the overall headcount of those in poverty, a BI [basic income] would change the composition of the income-poor population\u201d and thus \u201cwould not prove to be an effective tool for reducing poverty.\u201d [ 39 ]\nUBIs are also less cost-effective than targeted welfare programs because many people lack more than just cash. UBI does not cure addiction, poor health, lack of skills, or other factors that contribute to and exacerbate poverty. [ 19 ] [ 24 ]\nAnna Coote, Principal Fellow at the New Economics Foundation, and Edanur Yazici, PhD student, explain that there is \u201c the danger of UBI entrenching low pay and precarious work. It could effectively subsidise employers who pay low wages and \u2013 by creating a small cushion for workers on short-term and zero-hours contracts \u2013 help to normalise precarity.\u201d UBI could become like another American tipping system in which employers pay low wages and count on customers to fill in the gap with tips. [ 52 ]\nCon 2\nUBI is too expensive.\nA 2018 study found that a $1,000 a month stipend to every adult in the United States would cost about $3.81 trillion per year, or about 21% of the 2018 GDP, or about 78% of 2018 tax revenue. [ 57 ]\nA $2,000 a month per head of household UBI would cost an estimated $2.275 trillion annually, says Marc Joffe, MBA, MPA, Director of Policy Research at the California Policy Center. Some of this cost could be offset by eliminating federal, state, and local assistance programs; however, by Joffe\u2019s calculation, \u201cthese offsets total only $810 billion\u2026 [leaving] a net budgetary cost of over $1.4 trillion for a universal basic income program.\u201d [ 23 ]\nThe UBI trial in Finland provided participants with \u20ac560 ($673 USD) a month for two years. [21] lkka Kaukoranta, MS, Chief Economist of the Central Organization of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK), says that Finland\u2019s UBI model is \u201cimpossibly expensive, since it would increase the government deficit by about 5 percent [of GDP].\u201d [ 20 ]\nIn a Sep. 14, 2016 parliamentary debate, UK Minister for Employment, Damian Hinds, rejected the idea of UBI, saying that estimated implementation costs ranging from \u00a38.2 billion \u2013 \u00a3160 billion ($10.8 billion \u2013 $211 billion USD) are \u201cclearly unaffordable.\u201d [ 38 ]\nEconomist John Kay, Research Fellow at the University of Oxford, studied proposed UBI levels in Finland, France, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States, and concluded that, in all of these countries, UBI at a level which can guarantee an acceptable standard of living is \u201cimpossibly expensive\u2026 Either the level of basic income is unacceptably low, or the cost of providing it is unacceptably high.\u201d [ 41 ]\nCon 3\nUBI removes the incentive to work, adversely affecting the economy and leading to a labor and skills shortage.\nEarned income motivates people to work, be successful, work cooperatively with colleagues, and gain skills. However, \u201cif we pay people, unconditionally, to do nothing\u2026 they will do nothing\u201d and this leads to a less effective economy, says Charles Wyplosz, PhD, Professor of International Economics at the Graduate Institute in Geneva (Switzerland). [ 33 ]\nEconomist Allison Schrager, PhD, says that a strong economy relies on people being motivated to work hard, and in order to motivate people there needs to be an element of uncertainty for the future. UBI, providing guaranteed security, removes this uncertainty. [ 36 ]\nElizabeth Anderson, PhD, Professor of Philosophy and Women\u2019s Studies at the University of Michigan, says that a UBI would cause people \u201cto abjure work for a life of idle fun\u2026 [and would] depress the willingness to produce and pay taxes of those who resent having to support them.\u201d [ 17 ]\nGuaranteed income trials in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s found that the people who received payments worked fewer hours. [ 9 ] And, in 2016, the Swiss government opposed implementation of UBI, stating that it would entice fewer people to work and thus exacerbate the current labor and skills shortages. [ 34 ]\nNicholas Eberstadt, PhD, Henry Wendt Chair in Political Economy, and Evan Abramsky is a Research Associate, both at American Enterprise Institute (AEI), stated, \u201cthe daily routines of existing work-free men should make proponents of the UBI think long and hard. Instead of producing new community activists, composers, and philosophers, more paid worklessness in America might only further deplete our nation\u2019s social capital at a time when good citizenship is already in painfully short supply.\u201d [ 55 ]\nDiscussion Questions\n1.

The guarantee of UBI protects people from sluggish wage growth, low wages, and the lack of job security caused by the effects of the growing gig economy such as Uber/Lyft driving and short-term contracts, as well as increased automation in the workplace. [ 42 ] [ 5 ] [ 10 ] Researchers from the Roosevelt Institute created three models for US implementation of UBI and found that under all scenarios, UBI would grow the economy by increasing output, employment, prices, and wages. [ 44 ] Since implementation of the Alaska Permanent Fund, the increased purchasing power of UBI recipients has resulted in 10,000 additional jobs for the state. [ 6 ] UBI would also give employees the financial security to leave a bad job, or wait until the good job comes along to (re)join the job market. People won\u2019t have to take an awful job just to pay the bills. [ 54 ] UBI also enables people to stay in school longer and participate in training to improve skills or learn a trade. Uganda\u2019s UBI trial, the Youth Opportunities Program, enabled participants to invest in skills training as well as tools and materials, resulting in an increase of business assets by 57%, work hours by 17%, and earnings by 38%. [ 8 ] The Canadian Mincome trial in the 1970\u2019s found that participants of the trial were more likely to complete high school than counterparts not involved in the trial. [ 1 ] The Basic Income Grant trial in Namibia (2007-2012) enabled parents to afford school fees, buy school uniforms, and encourage attendance. As a result, school dropout rates fell from almost 40% in Nov. 2007 to 5% in June 2008 to almost 0% in Nov. 2008. [ 7 ] Pro 3 UBI guarantees income for non-working parents and caregivers, thus empowering important traditionally unpaid roles, especially for women. Guy Standing, PhD, Professor of Development Studies at the University of London (UK), says UBI makes all forms of work, including childcare and eldercare, \u201cequally deserving\u201d of payment. [ 25 ] In another article, Standing noted \u201cAlmost definitionally, a properly designed basic income system will reduce gender-based inequality, because on average the payment will represent a higher share of women\u2019s income.\u201d [ 56 ] A UBI also allows working parents to reduce their working hours in order to spend more time with their children or help with household chores. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Reviewing the UBI trial in India (2013-2014), SEWA Bharat (an organization related to women\u2019s employment) and UNICEF (a children\u2019s rights organization) concluded that \u201cwomen\u2019s empowerment was one of the more important outcomes of this experiment,\u201d noting that women receiving a UBI participated more in household decision making, and benefited from improved access to food, healthcare, and education. [ 14 ] The Basic Income Grant Coalition trial UBI in Namibia (2007-2012) found that UBI \u201creduced the dependency of women on men for their survival\u201d and reduced the pressure to engage in transactional sex. [ 7 ] Mincome, the Canadian UBI trial in the mid-1970s, found that emergency room visits as a result of domestic violence reduced during the period of the trial, possibly because of the reduction in income-inequality between women and men. [ 28 ] Con 1 Universal Basic Income (UBI) takes money from the poor and gives it to everyone, increasing poverty and depriving the poor of much needed targeted support. Universal Basic Income (UBI) takes money from the poor and gives it to everyone, increasing poverty and depriving the poor of much needed targeted support. People experiencing poverty face a variety of hardships that are addressed with existing anti-poverty measures such as food stamps, medical aid, and child assistance programs. UBI programs often use funds from these targeted programs for distribution to everyone in society. [ 15 ] According to Robert Greenstein, President of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, \u201c[i]f you take the dollars targeted on people in the bottom fifth or two-fifths of the population and convert them to universal payments to people all the way up the income scale, you\u2019re redistributing income upward. That would increase poverty and inequality rather than reduce them.\u201d [ 15 ] Luke Martinelli, PhD, Research Associate at the University of Bath, created three models of UBI implementation and concluded that all three would lead to a significant number of individuals and households who are worse off. He noted that \u201cthese losses are not concentrated among richer groups; on the contrary, they are proportionally larger for the bottom three income quintiles.\u201d [ 37 ] Research by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Finland, France, Italy, and the UK concluded that \u201crather than reducing the overall headcount of those in poverty, a BI [basic income] would change the composition of the income-poor population\u201d and thus \u201cwould not prove to be an effective tool for reducing poverty.\u201d [ 39 ] UBIs are also less cost-effective than targeted welfare programs because many people lack more than just cash. UBI does not cure addiction, poor health, lack of skills, or other factors that contribute to and exacerbate poverty. [ 19 ] [ 24 ] Anna Coote, Principal Fellow at the New Economics Foundation, and Edanur Yazici, PhD student, explain that there is \u201c the danger of UBI entrenching low pay and precarious work. It could effectively subsidise employers who pay low wages and \u2013 by creating a small cushion for workers on short-term and zero-hours contracts \u2013 help to normalise precarity.\u201d UBI could become like another American tipping system in which employers pay low wages and count on customers to fill in the gap with tips. [ 52 ] Con 2 UBI is too expensive. A 2018 study found that a $1,000 a month stipend to every adult in the United States would cost about $3.81 trillion per year, or about 21% of the 2018 GDP, or about 78% of 2018 tax revenue. [ 57 ] A $2,000 a month per head of household UBI would cost an estimated $2.275 trillion annually, says Marc Joffe, MBA, MPA, Director of Policy Research at the California Policy Center. Some of this cost could be offset by eliminating federal, state, and local assistance programs; however, by Joffe\u2019s calculation, \u201cthese offsets total only $810 billion\u2026 [leaving] a net budgetary cost of over $1.4 trillion for a universal basic income program.\u201d [ 23 ] The UBI trial in Finland provided participants with \u20ac560 ($673 USD) a month for two years. [21] lkka Kaukoranta, MS, Chief Economist of the Central Organization of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK), says that Finland\u2019s UBI model is \u201cimpossibly expensive, since it would increase the government deficit by about 5 percent [of GDP].\u201d [ 20 ] In a Sep. 14, 2016 parliamentary debate, UK Minister for Employment, Damian Hinds, rejected the idea of UBI, saying that estimated implementation costs ranging from \u00a38.2 billion \u2013 \u00a3160 billion ($10.8 billion \u2013 $211 billion USD) are \u201cclearly unaffordable.\u201d [ 38 ] Economist John Kay, Research Fellow at the University of Oxford, studied proposed UBI levels in Finland, France, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States, and concluded that, in all of these countries, UBI at a level which can guarantee an acceptable standard of living is \u201cimpossibly expensive\u2026 Either the level of basic income is unacceptably low, or the cost of providing it is unacceptably high.\u201d [ 41 ] Con 3 UBI removes the incentive to work, adversely affecting the economy and leading to a labor and skills shortage. Earned income motivates people to work, be successful, work cooperatively with colleagues, and gain skills. However, \u201cif we pay people, unconditionally, to do nothing\u2026 they will do nothing\u201d and this leads to a less effective economy, says Charles Wyplosz, PhD, Professor of International Economics at the Graduate Institute in Geneva (Switzerland). [ 33 ] Economist Allison Schrager, PhD, says that a strong economy relies on people being motivated to work hard, and in order to motivate people there needs to be an element of uncertainty for the future. UBI, providing guaranteed security, removes this uncertainty. [ 36 ] Elizabeth Anderson, PhD, Professor of Philosophy and Women\u2019s Studies at the University of Michigan, says that a UBI would cause people \u201cto abjure work for a life of idle fun\u2026 [and would] depress the willingness to produce and pay taxes of those who resent having to support them.\u201d [ 17 ] Guaranteed income trials in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s found that the people who received payments worked fewer hours. [ 9 ] And, in 2016, the Swiss government opposed implementation of UBI, stating that it would entice fewer people to work and thus exacerbate the current labor and skills shortages. [ 34 ] Nicholas Eberstadt, PhD, Henry Wendt Chair in Political Economy, and Evan Abramsky is a Research Associate, both at American Enterprise Institute (AEI), stated, \u201cthe daily routines of existing work-free men should make proponents of the UBI think long and hard. Instead of producing new community activists, composers, and philosophers, more paid worklessness in America might only further deplete our nation\u2019s social capital at a time when good citizenship is already in painfully short supply.\u201d [ 55 ] Discussion Questions 1.

[1] Material definitions of state power emphasize economic and military power. [2] [3] [4] Other definitions of power emphasize the ability to structure and constitute the nature of social relations between actors. [5] [4] Power is an attribute of particular actors in their interactions, as well as a social process that constitutes the social identities and capacities of actors. [5]\nInternational relations scholars use the term polarity to describe the distribution of power in the international system. [2] Unipolarity refers to an international system characterized by one hegemon (e.g. United States in the post-Cold War period), bipolarity to an order with two great powers or blocs of states (e.g. the Cold War), and multipolarity refers to the presence of three or more great powers. [2] Those states that have significant amounts of power within the international system are referred to as small powers , middle powers , regional powers , great powers , superpowers , or hegemons , although there is no commonly accepted standard for what defines a powerful state.\nEntities other than states can have power in international relations. Such entities can include multilateral international organizations , military alliance organizations like NATO , multinational corporations like Wal-Mart , [6] non-governmental organizations such as the Roman Catholic Church , or other institutions such as the Hanseatic League and technology companies like Facebook and Google .\nMichael Barnett and Raymond Duvall define power as \"the production, in and through social relations, of effects that shape the capacities of actors to determine their circumstances and fate.\" [5] They reject definitions of power that conflate power as any and all effects because doing so makes power synonymous with causality. [5] They also reject persuasion as part of the definition of power, as it revolves around actors freely and voluntarily changing their minds once presented with new information. [5]\nPolitical scientists , historians , and practitioners of international relations ( diplomats ) have used the following concepts of political power :\n- Power as a goal of states or leaders;\n- Power as a measure of influence or control over outcomes, events, actors and issues;\n- Power as victory in conflict and the attainment of security ;\n- Power as control over resources and capabilities ;\n- Power as status , which some states or actors possess and others do not.\nThe primary usage of \"power\" as a goal in international relations belongs to political theorists, such as Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli and Hans Morgenthau . [7] Especially among Classical Realist thinkers, power is an inherent goal of mankind and of states. Economic growth, military growth, cultural spread etc. can all be considered as working towards the ultimate goal of international power. The German military thinker Carl von Clausewitz [8] is considered to be the quintessential projection of European growth across the continent. In more modern times, Claus Moser has elucidated theories centre of distribution of power in Europe after the Holocaust, and the power of universal learning as its counterpoint. [9] Jean Monnet [10] was a French left-wing social theorist, stimulating expansive Eurocommunism, who followed on the creator of modern European community, the diplomat and statesman Robert Schuman . [11]\nPolitical scientists principally use \"power\" in terms of an actor's ability to exercise influence over other actors within the international system . This influence can be coercive , attractive, cooperative , or competitive . Mechanisms of influence can include the threat or use of force, economic interaction or pressure, diplomacy, and cultural exchange.\nUnder certain circumstances, states can organize a sphere of influence or a bloc within which they exercise predominant influence. Historical examples include the spheres of influence recognized under the Concert of Europe , or the recognition of spheres during the Cold War following the Yalta Conference . The Eastern Bloc , the Western Bloc , and the Non-Aligned Movement were the blocs that arose out of the Cold War contest. Military alliances like NATO and the Warsaw Pact are another forum through which influence is exercised. However, \" realist \" theory attempted to maintain the balance of power from the development of meaningful diplomatic relations that can create a hegemony within the region. British foreign policy , for example, dominated Europe through the Congress of Vienna after the defeat of France. They continued the balancing act with the Congress of Berlin in 1878, to appease Russia and Germany from attacking Turkey. Britain has sided against the aggressors on the European continent\u2014i.e. the German Empire , Nazi Germany , Napoleonic France or the Austrian Empire , known during the Great War as the Central Powers and, in World War II as the Axis Powers . [14] [15]\nInternational orders have both a material and social component. [16] Martha Finnemore argues that unipolarity does not just entail a material superiority by the unipole, but also a social structure whereby the unipole maintains its status through legitimation, and institutionalization. In trying to obtain legitimacy from the other actors in the international system, the unipole necessarily gives those actors a degree of power. The unipole also obtains legitimacy and wards off challenges to its power through the creation of institutions, but these institutions also entail a diffusion of power away from the unipole. [17] David Lake has argued along similar lines that legitimacy and authority are key components of international order. [18] [19]\nSusan Strange made a key contribution to International Political Economy on the issue of power , which she considered essential to the character and dynamics of the global economy. [20] Strange was skeptical of static indicators of power, arguing that it was structural power that mattered. [21] In particular, interactions between states and markets mattered. [22] She pointed to the superiority of the American technology sector, dominance in services, and the position of the U.S. dollar as the top international currency as real indicators of lasting power. [23] She distinguished between relational power (the power to compel A to get B to do something B does not want to do) and structural power (the power to shape and determine the structure of the global political economy). [24] Political scientists Henry Farrell and Abraham L. Newman argue that state power is in part derived from control over important nodes in global networks of informational and financial exchange, which means that states can \"weaponize interdependence\" by fighting over control of these nodes. [25]\nPower is also used when describing states or actors that have achieved military victories or security for their state in the international system. This general usage is most commonly found among the writings of historians or popular writers.\nAmerican author Charles W. Freeman, Jr. described power as the following:\nPower is the capacity to direct the decisions and actions of others. Power derives from strength and will. Strength comes from the transformation of resources into capabilities. Will infuses objectives with resolve. Strategy marshals capabilities and brings them to bear with precision. Statecraft seeks through strategy to magnify the mass, relevance, impact, and irresistibility of power. It guides the ways the state deploys and applies its power abroad. These ways embrace the arts of war, espionage, and diplomacy. The practitioners of these three arts are the paladins of statecraft. [26]\nPower is also used to describe the resources and capabilities of a state. This definition is quantitative and is most often [ dubious \u2013 discuss ] used by geopoliticians and the military. Capabilities are thought of in tangible terms\u2014they are measurable, weighable, quantifiable assets. A good example for this kind of measurement is the Composite Indicator on Aggregate Power , which involves 54 indicators and covers the capabilities of 44 states in Asia-Pacific from 1992 to 2012. [27] Hard power can be treated as a potential and is not often enforced on the international stage.\nChinese strategists have such a concept of national power that can be measured quantitatively using an index known as comprehensive national power .\nMichael Beckley argues that gross domestic product and military spending are imprecise indicators of power. He argues that better measurements of power should take into account \"net\" indicators of powers: \"[Gross] indicators systematically exaggerate the wealth and military capabilities of poor, populous countries, because they tally countries\u2019 resources without deducting the costs countries pay to police, protect, and serve their people. A country with a big population might produce vast output and field a large army, but it also may bear massive welfare and security burdens that drain its wealth and bog down its military, leaving it with few resources for power projection abroad.\" [28]\nMuch effort in academic and popular writing is devoted to deciding which countries have the status of \"power\", and how this can be measured. If a country has \"power\" (as influence) in military, diplomatic, cultural, and economic spheres, it might be called a \"power\" (as status). There are several categories of power, and inclusion of a state in one category or another is fraught with difficulty and controversy. In his famous 1987 work, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers , British-American historian Paul Kennedy charts the relative status of the various powers from AD 1500 to 2000. He does not begin the book with a theoretical definition of \"great power\"; however he lists them, separately, for many different eras. Moreover, he uses different working definitions of great power for different eras. For example;\n\"France was not strong enough to oppose Germany in a one-to-one struggle... If the mark of a Great Power is country which is willing to take on any other, then France (like Austria-Hungary) had slipped to a lower position. But that definition seemed too abstract in 1914 to a nation geared up for war, militarily stronger than ever, wealthy, and, above all,. endowed with powerful allies.\" [29]\nNeorealist scholars frequently define power as entailing military capabilities and economic strength. [2] [3] [30] Classical realists recognized that the ability to influence depended on psychological relationships that touched on ethical principles, legitimacy and justice, [31] as well as emotions, leaders' skill and power over opinion. [32] [31] [33]\nIn the modern geopolitical landscape, a number of terms are used to describe various types of powers, which include the following:\n- Superpower : In 1944, William T. R. Fox defined superpower as \"great power plus great mobility of power\" and identified three states, the British Empire , the Soviet Union and the United States . [34] With the decolonisation of the British Empire following World War II, and then the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States has remained to be the sole superpower. [35] China is now considered an emerging global superpower by many scholars. [36] [37] [38]\n- Great power : In historical mentions, the term great power refers to the states that have strong political, cultural and economical influence over nations around them and across the world. [39] [40] [41]\n- Middle power : A subjective description of influential second-tier states that could not quite be described as great or small powers. A middle power has sufficient strength and authority to stand on its own without the need of help from others (particularly in the realm of security ) and takes diplomatic leads in regional and global affairs. [42] Clearly not all middle powers are of equal status; some are members of forums such as the G20 and play important roles in the United Nations and other international organisations such as the WTO . [43]\n- Small power : The International System is for the most part made up by small powers . They are instruments of the other powers and may at times be dominated; but they cannot be ignored. [44]\n- Regional power : This term is used to describe a nation that exercises influence and power within a region. Being a regional power is not mutually exclusive with any of the other categories of power. The majority of them exert a strategic degree of influence as minor or secondary regional powers. A primary regional power (like Australia ) has an often important role in international affairs outside of its region too. [45]\n- Cultural superpower : Refers to a country whose culture , arts or entertainment have worldwide appeal, significant international popularity or large influence on much of the world. Countries such as China , [46] [47] [48] India , [49] Italy , [50] Japan , [51] [52] France , [53] [54] the United Kingdom , [55] the United States , [56] and South Korea [57] have often been described as cultural superpowers, although it is sometimes debated on which criteria this is determined. Unlike traditional forms of national power, the term cultural superpower is in reference to a nation's soft power capabilities.\n- Energy superpower : Describes a country that supplies large amounts of energy resources ( crude oil , natural gas , coal , uranium , etc.) to a significant number of other states, and therefore has the potential to influence world markets to gain a political or economic advantage. Saudi Arabia and Russia are generally acknowledged as the world's current energy superpowers, given their abilities to globally influence or even directly control prices to certain countries. Australia and Canada are potential energy superpowers due to their large natural resources. [58] [59]\nSome political scientists distinguish between two types of power: Hard and Soft. The former is coercive (example: military invasion ) while the latter is attractive (example: broadcast media or cultural invasion).\nHard power refers to coercive tactics: the threat or use of armed forces , economic pressure or sanctions , assassination and subterfuge, or other forms of intimidation. Hard power is generally associated to the stronger of nations, as the ability to change the domestic affairs of other nations through military threats. Realists and neorealists , such as John Mearsheimer , are advocates of the use of such power for the balancing of the international system.\nJoseph Nye is the leading proponent and theorist of soft power. Instruments of soft power include debates on cultural values, dialogues on ideology, the attempt to influence through good example, and the appeal to commonly accepted human values. Means of exercising soft power include diplomacy, dissemination of information, analysis, propaganda, and cultural programming to achieve political ends.\nOthers have synthesized soft and hard power, including through the field of smart power . This is often a call to use a holistic spectrum of statecraft tools, ranging from soft to hard.", "source_raw_text": "For other types of power, see Power .

[36] [37] [38] Great power : In historical mentions, the term great power refers to the states that have strong political, cultural and economical influence over nations around them and across the world. [39] [40] [41] Middle power : A subjective description of influential second-tier states that could not quite be described as great or small powers. A middle power has sufficient strength and authority to stand on its own without the need of help from others (particularly in the realm of security ) and takes diplomatic leads in regional and global affairs. [42] Clearly not all middle powers are of equal status; some are members of forums such as the G20 and play important roles in the United Nations and other international organisations such as the WTO . [43] Small power : The International System is for the most part made up by small powers . They are instruments of the other powers and may at times be dominated; but they cannot be ignored. [44] Regional power : This term is used to describe a nation that exercises influence and power within a region. Being a regional power is not mutually exclusive with any of the other categories of power. The majority of them exert a strategic degree of influence as minor or secondary regional powers. A primary regional power (like Australia ) has an often important role in international affairs outside of its region too. [45] Cultural superpower : Refers to a country whose culture , arts or entertainment have worldwide appeal, significant international popularity or large influence on much of the world. Countries such as China , [46] [47] [48] India , [49] Italy , [50] Japan , [51] [52] France , [53] [54] the United Kingdom , [55] the United States , [56] and South Korea [57] have often been described as cultural superpowers, although it is sometimes debated on which criteria this is determined. Unlike traditional forms of national power, the term cultural superpower is in reference to a nation's soft power capabilities. Energy superpower : Describes a country that supplies large amounts of energy resources ( crude oil , natural gas , coal , uranium , etc.) to a significant number of other states, and therefore has the potential to influence world markets to gain a political or economic advantage. Saudi Arabia and Russia are generally acknowledged as the world's current energy superpowers, given their abilities to globally influence or even directly control prices to certain countries. Australia and Canada are potential energy superpowers due to their large natural resources. [58] [59] Some political scientists distinguish between two types of power: Hard and Soft. The former is coercive (example: military invasion ) while the latter is attractive (example: broadcast media or cultural invasion). Hard power refers to coercive tactics: the threat or use of armed forces , economic pressure or sanctions , assassination and subterfuge, or other forms of intimidation. Hard power is generally associated to the stronger of nations, as the ability to change the domestic affairs of other nations through military threats. Realists and neorealists , such as John Mearsheimer , are advocates of the use of such power for the balancing of the international system. Joseph Nye is the leading proponent and theorist of soft power. Instruments of soft power include debates on cultural values, dialogues on ideology, the attempt to influence through good example, and the appeal to commonly accepted human values. Means of exercising soft power include diplomacy, dissemination of information, analysis, propaganda, and cultural programming to achieve political ends. Others have synthesized soft and hard power, including through the field of smart power . This is often a call to use a holistic spectrum of statecraft tools, ranging from soft to hard.", "documentFile": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(international_relations)"}, {"source_title":

"Yet disciplinary discussions tend to privilege only one, albeit important, form: an actor controlling another to do what that other would not otherwise do.", "By showing conceptual favoritism, the discipline not only overlooks the different forms of power in international politics, but also fails to develop sophisticated understandings of how global outcomes are produced and how actors are differentially enabled and constrained to determine their fates.", "We argue that scholars of international relations should employ multiple conceptions of power and develop a conceptual framework that encourages rigorous attention to power in its different forms.", "We first begin by producing a taxonomy of power.", "Power is the production, in and through social relations, of effects that shape the capacities of actors to determine their circumstances and fate.", "This general concept entails two crucial, analytical dimensions: the kinds of social relations through which power works (in relations of interaction or in social relations of constitution); and the specificity of social relations through which effects are produced (specific/direct or diffuse/indirect).", "These distinctions generate our taxonomy and four concepts of power: compulsory, institutional, structural, and productive.", "We then illustrate how attention to the multiple forms of power matters for the analysis of global governance and American empire.", "We conclude by urging scholars to beware of the idea that the multiple concepts are competing, and instead to see connections between them in order to generate more robust understandings of how power works in international politics.", "\n\u00a9 2005 The IO Foundation and Cambridge University Press\nThe potentially system-defining attacks of September 11, the war on terrorism, and the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq have caused scholars and practitioners to refocus attention on a central concept in international politics: power.", "If the past is a good predictor of the future, however, debate is likely to be limited conceptually, informed primarily by a realist conception of power\u2014the ability of states to use material resources to get others to do what they otherwise would not.", "Indeed, this is already happening.", "Much of the conversation triggered by the U.S. invasion of Iraq, for instance, has focused on unipolarity, the ability of the United States to use its military and economic resources to overcome resistance by states and nonstate actors, and whether other states will balance against or bandwagon with U.S. power.", "Certainly, any consideration of power in international politics must include such questions.", "But, Mae West's views notwithstanding, too much of a good thing is not always wonderful.", "Instead, it can produce theoretical tunnel vision that causes scholars to overlook others forms and effects of power.", "In this essay we argue that scholars of international relations must work with multiple conceptions of power, suggest how they can accomplish this task, and demonstrate how a consideration of power's polymorphous character will enhance and deepen theoretic understanding of international politics.", "\nEver since Carr delivered his devastating rhetorical blow against the \u201cutopians\u201d and claimed power for \u201crealism,\u201d the discipline of international relations has tended to treat power as the exclusive province of realism.", "1\nAccordingly, a concern with power in international politics is frequently interpreted as a disciplinary attachment to realism.", "Associated with this tendency, there is a widely accepted conceptualization that is viewed as the only way to understand power: how one state uses its material resources to compel another state to do something it does not want to do.", "Most introductory texts to international relations cleave to this formulation.", "Attempts by scholars to operationalize power follow from this definition.", "2\nThe substantial literature on the \u201cparadoxes of power\u201d revolves around the disconnect between capabilities and outcomes.", "3\nThe disciplinary tendency to associate power with realism and to work primarily with the realist conceptualization partly owes to the fact that rivals to realism typically distance themselves from \u201cpower\u201d considerations.", "4\nWe recognize this narrative of the discipline necessarily overlooks other contributions that never pivoted around realism.", "Later in the article we introduce some of these alternative perspectives.", "\nThis feature has been especially visible in recent years, as neoliberal institutionalists, liberals, and constructivists have attempted to demonstrate their theoretical salience by demonstrating how \u201cpower\u201d variables are not causally consequential in their explanation of empirical outcomes.", "Neoliberals have argued how states with convergent interests create international institutions and arrangements that effectively tame (state) power, highlighting processes of social choice and leaving the impression that institutions are the antidote to power.", "5\nScholars of liberal international relations theory typically stress that many important international outcomes cannot be adequately explained with reference to power, but instead are better understood by the salutary presence of democracy, particular configurations of domestic interests, liberal values, economic interdependence, or international institutions.", "6\nMainstream constructivists, too, have pitted themselves against explanations in terms of power as they have attempted to demonstrate the causal significance of normative structures and processes of learning and persuasion.", "7\nBecause these rivals to realism have juxtaposed their arguments to realism's emphasis on power, they have neglected to develop how power is conceptualized and operates within their theories.", "It could have been otherwise.", "These theoretical approaches draw from distinct social theoretic traditions that offer critical insights into the forms and effects of power.", "Although neoliberal institutionalists have tended to highlight how international institutions produce cooperation, they could just as easily have emphasized how institutions shape the bargaining advantage of actors, freeze asymmetries, and establish parameters for change that benefit some at the expense of others.", "Although liberals have tended to limit their claims to the liberalism of \u201cprogress,\u201d they could have developed the liberalism of \u201cfear\u201d that is more centrally concerned with power.", "8\nAlthough constructivists have emphasized how underlying normative structures constitute actors' identities and interests, they have rarely treated these normative structures themselves as defined and infused by power, or emphasized how constitutive effects also are expressions of power.", "A consequence of this failure to develop alternative conceptualizations of power has been to reinforce the discipline's gravitation toward the default conception as defined by realism.", "Yet, as famously noted by Gallie, and as repeated by social theorists ever since, power is an essentially contested concept.", "9\nIts status owes not only to the desire by scholars to agree to disagree, but also to their awareness that power works in various forms and has various expressions that cannot be captured by a single formulation.", "\nThe failure to develop alternative conceptualizations of power limits the ability of international relations scholars to understand how global outcomes are produced and how actors are differentially enabled and constrained to determine their fates.", "One certainly needs to know about the ability of actors to use resources to control the behavior of others.", "The United States is able to use its military power to compel others to change their foreign policies, and in the contemporary period transnational activists have been able to shame multinational corporations and abusive governments to alter their economic and human rights policies, respectively.", "Any discussion of power in international politics, then, must include a consideration of how, why, and when some actors have \u201cpower over\u201d others.", "Yet one also needs to consider the enduring structures and processes of global life that enable and constrain the ability of actors to shape their fates and their futures.", "The extension of sovereignty from the West to the developing world gave decolonized states the authority to voice their interests and represent themselves, and the emergence of a human rights discourse helped to make possible the very category of human rights activists who give voice to human rights norms.", "Analysis of power in international relations, then, must include a consideration of how social structures and processes generate differential social capacities for actors to define and pursue their interests and ideals.", "10\nThe starting point for opening the conceptual aperture is to identify the critical dimensions that generate different conceptualizations of power.", "In general terms, power is the production, in and through social relations, of effects that shape the capacities of actors to determine their circumstances and fate.", "11\nThis definition slightly amends Scott 2001 , 1\u20132, by pointing explicitly to the operation of power through social relations.", "\nThe general concept of power that we employ is restricted to the production of particular kinds of effects, namely those on the capacities of actors to determine the conditions of their existence.", "There is an alternative tradition that sees power as the production of any and all effects and thus as nearly synonymous with causality.", "12\nWhat does this alternative tradition keep in that we leave out?", "It includes social relations of joint action through mutual agreement and interactions in which one actor is able to convince another actor to alter voluntarily and freely its beliefs, interests, or action.", "Persuasion, then, is social causation but falls outside of our concept of power.", "So, too, do processes of collective choice that produce joint action.", "We believe that our circumscribed conception is preferable for two reasons.", "It better reflects conventional understandings insofar as most scholars interested in power are concerned not simply with how effects are produced, but rather with how these effects work to the advantage of some and the disadvantage of others.", "We also believe that a focus on differential effects on actor capacities is, empirically, closer to the mark in most social relations.", "There are moments of completely voluntary persuasion and collective choice, but they are certainly rare and, on close inspection, likely to have uneven effects.", "\nThis definition informs our argument that conceptual distinctions of power should be represented in terms of two analytical dimensions that are at the core of the general concept: the kinds of social relations through which power works; and the specificity of social relations through which effects on actors' capacities are produced.", "The first dimension\u2014kinds\u2014refers to the polar positions of social relations of interaction and social relations of constitution.", "Accordingly, power is either an attribute of particular actors and their interactions or a social process of constituting what actors are as social beings, that is, their social identities and capacities.", "It can operate, for example, by pointing a gun and issuing commands, or in underlying social structures and systems of knowledge that advantage some and disadvantage others.", "The second dimension\u2014specificity\u2014concerns the degree to which the social relations through which power works are direct and socially specific or indirect and socially diffuse.", "It can operate, for example, at the very instant when the gun is brandished, or through diffuse processes embedded in international institutions that establish rules determining who gets to participate in debates and make decisions.", "\nThese two dimensions generate our taxonomy of four types of power.", "13\nOur taxonomy bears some resemblance to, but is distinct from, the conventional \u201cfour faces\u201d approach to power because, we contend, ours is analytically more systematic and precise, and conceptually more general.", "Digeser nicely summarizes the differences among the four faces in the following way: \u201cUnder the first face of power the central question is, \u2018Who, if anyone, is exercising power?\u2019", "Under the second face, \u2018What issues have been mobilized off the agenda and by whom?\u2019", "Under the radical conception, \u2018Whose objective interests are being harmed?\u2019", "Under the fourth face of power the critical issue is, \u2018What kind of subject is being produced?\u2019\u201d", "Digeser 1992 , 980.", "For other summaries of these faces, see Hayward 2000 , chap.", "1; and Hay 1997 .", "Because the four faces developed sequentially through a progressive debate about gaps and absences in prior conceptions, they are not elements in a systematic typology.", "There are no analytical dimensions that distinguish across all four faces, and the faces overlap and blur into one another.", "\nEffective taxonomic exercises must try to \u201ccarve nature at its joints\u201d to derive critical, mutually exclusive, and exhaustive distinctions.", "14\nToward this end, in the first section below we present our attempt to carve power at its joints.", "The first type is power as relations of interaction of direct control by one actor over another\u2014Compulsory Power; the second is the control actors exercise indirectly over others through diffuse relations of interaction\u2014Institutional Power; the third is the constitution of subjects' capacities in direct structural relation to one another\u2014Structural Power; and the fourth is the socially diffuse production of subjectivity in systems of meaning and signification\u2014Productive Power.", "These different conceptualizations provide distinct answers to the fundamental question: in what respects are actors able to determine their fate, and how is that ability limited or enhanced through social relations with others?\nOur taxonomy of power offers several advantages for scholars of international relations theory.", "First, because it is founded on an explicit and logically systematic decomposition of the general concept of power, it is able to detach discussions of power from the limitations of realism and to encourage scholars to see power's multiple forms.", "Realism's prominence has contributed to a situation in which scholars are often asked to choose a realist formulation to the neglect of an alternative, or vice versa.", "15\nThose who want to expand the conceptualization of power frequently pose theirs as a supplement or an alternative to the realist benchmark.", "Nye, for example, offers his concept of \u201csoft power\u201d as a counterpoint to the realist emphasis on \u201chard power.\u201d", "16\nGruber's concept of \u201cgo-it-alone power\u201d is a modification of realist-influenced approaches.", "17\nAlthough these statements usefully expand the scope of the concept, their posing as an alternative to a realist formulation presumes that scholars must choose sides.", "Because our taxonomy alerts scholars to the fact that multiple forms of power are simultaneously present in international politics, it discourages a presumptive dismissal of other conceptual forms.", "\nSecond, our approach provides a framework for integration.", "Taxonomies not only highlight distinct types but also point to connections between them.", "In other words, the different types should not be seen as necessarily competing concepts, but rather as different forms in which power works in international politics.", "Our framework, therefore, suggests how scholars might consider how productive power makes some instances of compulsory power possible and legitimate, and, in turn, how compulsory power shapes the terms of meaning that influence how actors see what is possible and desirable.", "\nThird, our approach represents a decisive advantage over recent contributions to the debate about power in international relations because it incorporates both social relations of interaction and constitution, that is, both \u201cpower over\u201d and \u201cpower to.\u201d", "Baldwin's influential contributions have relied heavily on a Dahlian formulation\u2014in which A exercises influence over B\u2014and then attempt to incorporate a variety of concerns, including unintended effects and nonmaterial means of influence.", "18\nAlthough we agree with him on many points, a fundamental problem is that his actor-oriented approach is incapable of recognizing social relations of constitution and how power inheres in structures and discourses that are not possessed or controlled by any single actor.", "In a series of important articles, Guzzini has urged international relations scholars to expand their understanding of power.", "19\nSee Guzzini 1993 , 2000 , and 2002 .", "\nAlthough our approaches overlap, they nevertheless differ in two important respects.", "First, he insists that power be reserved for moments when an actor intentionally produces effects, and that constitutive arguments be understood as \u201cgovernance.\u201d", "20\nWe believe that by limiting power to those effects that are intentionally produced, he unnecessarily overlooks the important ways in which effects on the capacities and courses of action available to actors are unintentionally produced through social relations.", "Also, by treating power as an \u201cagent concept\u201d and creating a new concept, \u201cgovernance,\u201d for those \u201ceffects not due to a particular agent,\u201d he establishes a false dichotomy.", "21\nIbid., 443.\nGovernance necessarily entails power; the two are not in conceptual opposition.", "Our taxonomy, therefore, provides a systematic way of thinking about power in terms of both agency and structure, and thus allows us to incorporate the two elements of his argument in a single integrated conceptual framework.", "\nLast, but hardly least, our taxonomy does not map precisely onto different theories of international relations.", "To be sure, each theoretical tradition does favor an understanding of power that corresponds to one or another of the concepts distinguished by our taxonomy.", "For instance, as noted above, realists work with versions that correspond to compulsory power, and critical theorists typically work with versions that correspond to structural or productive power.", "But, as we show, it need not be this way.", "Scholars can and should draw from various conceptualizations of power that are associated with other theoretical schools.", "We believe that such poaching and cross-fertilization is healthy, needed, and might, in a small way, help scholars move away from perpetual rivalry in disciplinary \u201cism\u201d wars and toward dialogue across theoretical perspectives.", "\nIn the second section we briefly illustrate why attention to the multiple forms of power affects empirical research through reference to two domains of contemporary theoretical significance\u2014global governance and the debate over American empire.", "As scholars continue to consider power in international politics, they would do well not to fixate on a single rendition but instead to appreciate how the range of conceptualizations provides the basis for a better, richer, and fuller understanding of the workings of world politics.", "We conclude on this theme, briefly discussing how such cross-fertilization builds bridges between these concepts, and how scholars might think about the possible relationships.", "\nPower is the production, in and through social relations, of effects on actors that shape their capacity to control their fate.", "This concept has two dimensions at its core: (1) the kinds of social relations through which actors' capacities are affected (and effected); and, (2) the specificity of those social relations.", "Conventionally for social theorists, social relations can be viewed as being broadly of two kinds: relations of interaction among previously constituted social actors; or relations of constitution of actors as particular kinds of social beings.", "For the second dimension, the crucial distinction is whether the social relations of interaction or constitution through which power works are direct and specific, or indirect and socially diffuse.", "Below we explore each dimension, then show how the polar positions within each dimension combine to generate our taxonomy of power.", "\nThe first dimension concerns whether power works in interactions or social constitution.", "One position on this dimension treats social relations as comprised of the actions of preconstituted social actors toward one another.", "Here, power works through behavioral relations or interactions, which, in turn, affect the ability of others to control the circumstances of their existence.", "In these conceptions, power nearly becomes an attribute that an actor possesses and may use knowingly as a resource to shape the actions or conditions of action of others.", "\nThe other position consists of social relations of constitution.", "Here, power works through social relations that analytically precede the social or subject positions of actors and that constitute them as social beings with their respective capacities and interests.", "Constitutive relations cannot be reduced to the attributes, actions, or interactions of pregiven actors.", "Power, accordingly, is irreducibly social.", "In other words, constitutive arguments examine how particular social relations are responsible for producing particular kinds of actors.", "As Wendt puts it, \u201cConstitutive theories \u2026 account for the properties of things by reference to the structures in virtue of which they exist.\u201d", "22\nBecause these social relations, in effect, generate different social kinds that have different self- (and other-) understandings and capacities, they have real consequences for an actor's ability to shape the conditions and processes of its existence.", "\nThis conceptual distinction between power working through social relations of interaction or in social relations of constitution tracks fairly closely with a distinction that frequents the literature on power: \u201cpower over\u201d and \u201cpower to.\u201d", "Concepts of power rooted in behavior and interaction point to actors' exercise of control over others; they are, then, \u201cpower over\u201d concepts.", "Concepts of power tied to social relations of constitution, in contrast, consider how social relations define who the actors are and what capacities and practices they are socially empowered to undertake; these concepts are, then, focused on the social production of actors' \u201cpower to.\u201d", "Some scholars, who examine how constitutive relations make possible certain types of action, focus on how community or collective action are facilitated, while others stress how the social relations of constitution can have a disciplining effect and therefore lead to self-regulation and internalized constraints.", "23\nIn either case, though, the concern is with the effect of social relations of constitution on human capacity.", "\nThis interaction/constitutive distinction also foregrounds particular features of the effects of power.", "Because power is a property of actors' actions and interactions in behavioral conceptions, there is a strong tendency to see its effects primarily in terms of the behavior of the object of power.", "In contrast, constitutive power is generally seen as producing effects only in terms of the identities of the occupants of social positions.", "We want to stress, though, that there is no ontological or epistemological reason why scholars working with one of those concepts need exclude the effects identified by the other.", "If power works through the actions of specific actors in shaping the ways and the extent to which other actors exercise control over their fate, it can have a variety of effects, ranging from directly affecting the behavior of others to setting the terms of their very self-understandings; behavioral power, then, can have effects on actors' subjectivities and self-understandings.", "Similarly, if power is in social relations of constitution, it works in fixing what actors are as social beings, which, in turn, defines the meaningful practices in which they are disposed to engage as subjects; constitutive power, then, has effects on behavioral tendencies.", "Thus scholars examining power through social interaction can see effects on social identities, and those examining power through constitutive relations can see effects on action.", "\nThe second core analytical dimension concerns how specific\u2014direct and immediate\u2014are the social relations through which power works.", "Specific relations of power entail some immediate and generally tangible causal or constitutive connection between the subject and the object, or between two subjects.", "Scholars working with this conception tend to presume that connections between actors are mechanistic, flush with contact, direct, or logically necessary.", "A consequence of this dependence on social proximity is that it becomes more difficult to observe power in operation the greater is the social distance, the lag between stimulus and effect, or the absence of logical necessity, characterizing these connections.", "\nThis approach is nicely summarized by Dahl's famous claim that there is \u201cno action at a distance.\u201d", "24\nAlthough Dahl intentionally left vague both what counts as \u201cdistance\u201d and the meaning of \u201cconnection\u201d between two actors, he stressed that a relation of power is knowable if and only if there is an observable and traceable connection between A and B. Consequently, while his conceptualization did not preclude the idea of power as spatially, temporally, or socially indirect or diffuse, it did work against it.", "But it is not only Dahl's and related behavioral conceptions that operate with a specific and direct view of power.", "Some constitutive analyses do so as well.", "For example, scholars such as Bhaskar, Giddens, and Wendt point to the structured relationship of co-constitution between social roles or structural positions (such as Marxian class categories), and how their social capacities are defined in direct and specific relation to other roles or positions.", "25\nIn this way, they identify a direct and specific relationship between the social positions, which are jointly constituted structurally.", "26\nAlso see Isaac 1987 .", "\nThis is how Marxist approaches consider, for instance, the co-constitutive social relations of capital and labor in capitalism; the capitalist class structure generates distinctive social capacities and interests of the social positions of capital and labor.", "In general, specific relations concern the direct causal/constitutive connection between actors that are in physical, historical, or social positional proximity.", "\nOther approaches see power in indirect and socially diffuse relations.", "Instead of insisting that power work through an immediate, direct, and specific relationship, these conceptions allow for the possibility of power even if the connections are detached and mediated, or operate at a physical, temporal, or social distance.", "Scholars that locate power in the rules of institutions, whether formal or informal, frequently trace its operation to such indirect mechanisms.", "Those examining concrete institutions have shown how evolving rules and decision-making procedures can shape outcomes in ways that favor some groups over others; these effects can operate over time and at a distance, and often in ways that were not intended or anticipated by the architects of the institution.", "27\nSimilarly, scholars influenced by poststructuralism examine how historically and contingently produced discourses shape the subjectivities of actors; the very reason for genealogical and discourse-analytic methods is to demonstrate how systems of knowledge and discursive practices produce subjects through social relations that are quite indirect, socially diffuse, and temporally distant.", "28\nFor instance, students of gender, race, and nation routinely recognize how socially diffuse discourses, and not isolated, direct, and proximate actions, produce the subjects of the modern world.", "29\nThese two core dimensions\u2014the kinds of social relations through which power works, and the specificity of the social relations through which power's effects are produced\u2014generate a fourfold taxonomy of power as illustrated in Figure 1 .", "Each cell in Figure 1 represents a different conceptual type.", "Compulsory power exists in the direct control of one actor over the conditions of existence and/or the actions of another.", "Institutional power exists in actors' indirect control over the conditions of action of socially distant others.", "Structural power operates as the constitutive relations of a direct and specific\u2014hence, mutually constituting\u2014kind.", "Productive power works through diffuse constitutive relations to produce the situated social capacities of actors.", "\nTaxonomy of power\nBecause concepts of power are partly distinguished by the conceptualized relationship between agency and structure, our taxonomy relates to the agent-structure duality to the extent that the generic concern is with the relationship between social context and human action.", "We want to stress, though, that because each type of power has at least an implicit view of both agency and structure, none simply reflects an entirely agentic or structural perspective (to the neglect of the other).", "Nevertheless, they do vary in specific ways.", "Compulsory (and, to a lesser degree, institutional) power emphasizes agency to the point where structure becomes the context in which A's actions and B's reactions are set and constrained, thereby leaning heavily on agency and treating structure as constraint.", "In contrast, concepts of structural and productive power emphasize structure relative to purposeful agency, even while recognizing that meaningful practices, and hence, human agency, are essential in producing, reproducing and possibly transforming these structures.", "\nThis first concept of power focuses on a range of relations between actors that allow one to shape directly the circumstances or actions of another.", "Some of the most famous and widely used definitions of power fall under this concept.", "Weber defined power as the \u201cprobability that one actor within a social relationship will be in a position to carry out his own will despite resistance, regardless of the basis on which this probability exists.\u201d", "30\nSimilarly, Blau defined it as the influence over behavior through negative sanctions.", "31\nIn terms of sheer influence, especially for scholars of international relations, arguably no definition surpasses that of Dahl's earliest formulation.", "32\nDahl 1957 , 202\u20133.", "As Baldwin 2002 , 177, claimed, \u201cnone rivals this one in widespread acceptability.\u201d", "Dahl modified his views in later statements.", "See Dahl and Stinebrickner 2003 .", "\nFor him, power is best understood as the ability of A to get B to do what B otherwise would not do.", "Dahl's concept has three defining features.", "One, there is intentionality on the part of Actor A.

difference owes chiefly to their different theoretic understandings of structure.", "Scholars focusing on institutional power usually define institutions and structure in almost interchangeable terms, as sets of rules, procedures, and norms that constrain the action of already-constituted actors with fixed preferences.", "Scholars focusing on structural power conceive structure as an internal relation\u2014that is, a direct constitutive relation such that the structural position, A, exists only by virtue of its relation to structural position, B. 51\nThe classic examples here are master-slave and capital-labor relations.", "From this perspective, the kinds of social beings that are mutually constituted are directly or internally related; that is, the social relational capacities, subjectivities, and interests of actors are directly shaped by the social positions that they occupy.", "\nStructural power shapes the fates and conditions of existence of actors in two critical ways.", "One, structural positions do not necessarily generate equal social privileges; instead structures allocate differential capacities, and typically differential advantages, to different positions.", "Capital-labor and master-slave relations are obvious examples of how social structures constitute unequal social privileges and capacities.", "Two, the social structure not only constitutes actors and their capacities, it also shapes their self-understanding and subjective interests.", "The consequence is that structures that distribute asymmetric privileges also affect the interests of actors, often leaving them willing to \u201caccept their role in the existing order of things.\u201d", "52\nIn other words, structural power can work to constrain some actors from recognizing their own domination.", "To the degree that it does, actors' self-understandings and dispositions for action serve to reproduce, rather than to resist, the differential capacities and privileges of structure.", "As Steven Lukes observed: \u201cis it not the supreme and most insidious exercise of power to prevent people, to whatever degree, from having grievances shaping their perceptions, cognitions, and preferences in such a way that they accept their role in the existing order of things?\u201d", "53\nIbid.", "It is possible to construct a compulsory power answer to this question.", "For instance, A might act to alter the beliefs of B, thereby making it easier to control B, as it is always easier to maintain a social order through consent than through coercion.",

this way, structural power operates even when there are no instances of A acting to exercise control over B. 54\nThis approach relates to the distinction between objective and subjective interests.",

concept.", "55\nMarxists are not alone in emphasizing structural power.", "Bourdieu 2001 focuses on the global importance of masculine domination produced through the structure of patriarchy.", "Strange 1989 developed a non-Marxian approach to what she calls structural power.", "\nExplicitly following Lukes and Gramsci, Gill and Law argue that while power exists in coercion and institutional arrangements, to understand the workings of the global capitalist economy requires recognition of global production relations as constitutive structure.", "56\nFor them, as well as other Gramscians and historical materialists, the structure of global capitalism substantially determines the capacities and resources of actors.", "57\nIt also shapes their ideology\u2014that is, the interpretive system through which they understand their interests and desires.", "This ideology, according to scholars like Gill and Law, is hegemonic in that it serves the objective interests of the capitalists and their fellow travelers at the direct expense of the objective (but not, then, recognized) interests of the world's producing classes, thereby disposing action toward the reproduction, rather than the substantial transformation, of the structure and its relations of domination.", "In the same spirit, Cox draws on Machiavelli's notion of power as a centaur: it operates overtly to the extent that one actor will manipulate strategic constraints for the purposes of controlling the actions of actors (the beast of compulsory and institutional power), and it operates covertly to the extent that it generates the social powers, values, and interpretations of reality that deeply structure internal control (the man that is structural power).", "58\nWorld-systems theorists also draw on this conception of power to the extent that they argue that: structures of production generate particular kinds of states identified as core, semiperiphery, and periphery; the positions in the world-system generate commensurate sets of identities and interests; and those in the subordinate positions adopt (ideologically generated) conceptions of interest that support their own domination and their lesser position in that world-system.", "59\nBecause many constructivists draw from structurally oriented theories of sociology, they also are sometimes attentive to structural power.", "Wendt, for instance, argues that \u201ca key aspect of any cultural form is its role structure, the configuration of subject positions that shared ideas make available to its holders.\u201d", "60\nHe proceeds to note that the role structures can contain functional differentiation and thus generate differential privileges and capacities to the occupants of these roles.", "61\nAlthough constructivists who draw from sociological institutionalism do not usually adopt a notion of structure as a set of internal relations, they make a related conceptual move, suggesting a hint of structural power, to the extent that rules, which often are associated with and can generate roles, produce the identities and interests of actors.", "62\nThis tendency is especially evident among those associated with the world polity school.", "Boli and Thomas, for instance, argue that there is a world authority structure, a set of fundamental principles, that constitutes who are the actors of world politics, what are their identities, what are their expressive purposes, and what are their differential capacities.", "Consequently, they argue that the institutionalization of a world authority structure that is organized around rational-legal values increasingly privileges the voices of international nongovernmental organizations.", "63\nProductive power and structural power overlap in several important respects.", "Both are attentive to constitutive social processes that are, themselves, not controlled by specific actors, but that are effected only through the meaningful practices of actors.", "Both concern how the social capacities of actors are socially produced, and how these processes shape actors' self-understandings and perceived interests.", "Additionally, neither concept of power depends on the existence of expressed conflict (although resistance is at the heart of the dynamics of change of them).", "\nYet structural and productive power differ in a critical respect: whereas the former works through direct structural relations, the latter entails more generalized and diffuse social processes.", "Specifically, and at the risk of gross simplification, structural power is structural constitution, that is, the production and reproduction of internally related positions of super- and subordination, or domination, that actors occupy.", "Productive power, by contrast, is the constitution of all social subjects with various social powers through systems of knowledge and discursive practices of broad and general social scope.", "Conceptually, the move is away from structures, per se, to systems of signification and meaning (which are structured, but not themselves structures), and to networks of social forces perpetually shaping one another.", "In that respect, attention to productive power looks beyond (or is post-) structures.", "\nThis difference between direct and diffuse social relations of constitution has two important implications for thinking about productive power.", "First, productive power concerns discourse, the social processes and the systems of knowledge through which meaning is produced, fixed, lived, experienced, and transformed.", "64\nDiscourses are understood here not as dialogues among specific actors or in terms of Habermasian notions of communicative action.", "Instead, the concept refers to how \u201cmicrofields\u201d or the quotidian \u201cdefine the (im)possible, the (im)probable, the natural, the normal, what counts as a problem.\u201d", "65\nIn this way, discourses are sites of social relations of power because they situate ordinary practices of life and define the social fields of action that are imaginable and possible.", "66\nSecond, discursive processes and practices produce social identities and capacities as they give meaning to them.", "In Foucault's archetypical formulation, humans are not only power's intended targets, but also its effects.", "67\nDiscourse, therefore, is socially productive for all subjects, constituting the subjectivity of all social beings of diverse kinds with their contingent, though not entirely fluid, identities, practices, rights, responsibilities, and social capacities.", "68\nProductive power, therefore, differs from structural power in its approach to subjectivity.", "Because structural power concerns the co-constitution of subjects, it typically envisions hierarchical and binary relations of domination that work to the advantage of those structurally empowered, to the disadvantage of the socially weak.", "In contrast, productive power concerns the boundaries of all social identity, and the capacity and inclination for action for the socially advantaged and disadvantaged alike, as well as the myriad social subjects that are not constituted in binary hierarchical relationships.", "69\nFor a range of statements that address these differences, see Ball 1992 ; Barnes 1988 ; Benton 1981 ; Wartenberg 1992 ; and Isaac 1987 .", "\nProductive power, in this way, refuses\nto assume that some essence is at the root of human subjectivity, [and raises] the possibility that every ordering of social relations, and every ordering of

"70\nHayward 2000 , 6 (emphasis in the original).", "\nIn general, the bases and workings of productive power are the socially existing and, hence, historically contingent and changing understandings, meanings, norms, customs, and social identities that make possible, limit, and are drawn on for action.", "71\nIbid., 30.\n", "Some of the best examples of the analysis of productive power in

does more than alert scholars to the different forms of power, though, for it also encourages a consideration of their conjunction.", "To demonstrate the value of our taxonomy for seeing the distinctive forms and the linkages between them, we consider two major issues in global politics\u2014global governance, and American empire.", "\nScholars of global governance often define it as the

of cooperation and coordination, practices of international law, and the processes of collective action that they entail, are effected in and through institutions.", "Institutional power thus provides

consideration of institutional power also exposes the governing biases of institutions.", "As we noted in the conceptual discussion above, the institutional rules that establish a particular focal point also serve to generate unequal leverage or influence in determining collective outcomes.", "82\nIn short, the institutions that are established to help actors achieve pareto-superior outcomes also create \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers,\u201d to the extent that the ability to use the institution and, accordingly, collective rewards are unevenly distributed.", "83\nThis institutional context, moreover, lingers into the future, thus constraining action in ways that might not have been intended but nevertheless limit choice and shape action.", "84\nThis is precisely the point of considerable contemporary criticism of a number of formal organizations involved in governing the global economy, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).", "85\nRecent analyses of the international refugee regime also have noted how legal and normative changes have potentially come at the expense of refugees.", "86\nThird, also consistent with the biases of institutions is the ability of great powers to establish international institutions and arrangements to further or preserve their interests and positions of advantage into the future, even as they do not directly or fully control those future arrangements.", "Gruber's concept and application of \u201cgo-it-alone\u201d power suggests how strong states undertake a course of action that subsequently shapes future outcomes for others, and that weak states go along with an agreement that may actually leave them worse off, because to oppose the inevitable will only cost them more in the long run.", "87\nIn short, for Gruber, weaker states are damned if they do and doubly damned if they do not.", "Significantly, it is less important that the outcome is willfully intended than that it is an effect of asymmetrical ability to shape the context of choice or decision.", "Strange argued that while American power as defined by material resources might be in decline (at the time of her writing), the United States is the epicenter of a transnational empire that gives it the ability to shape security, financial, productive, and knowledge structures, which, in turn, operate to U.S. advantage and foreclose opportunities to other countries.", "88\nIkenberry has argued that liberal great powers have attempted to use their positions of power after war to establish international governance mechanisms that simultaneously preserve and diffuse their power.", "89\nIn sum, the institutional core of global governance, while seemingly resting on the production of joint gains through cooperation or coordination, also entails the substantial operation of institutional power.", "\nBut institutional power, alone, does not tell the whole story.", "The example of great powers attempting to shape institutions suggests more traditional senses of \u201cpower struggles,\u201d which directs attention to compulsory power.", "Here, most obviously, the concern is with how states, and largely the great powers, are able to determine the content and direction of global governance by using their decisive material advantages not only to determine what areas are to be governed, but also to directly \u201ccoordinate\u201d the actions of lesser powers so that they align with their interests.", "90\nOther examples of this form of power include the U.S. efforts to determine the terms of the International Criminal Court by manipulating incentives for particular targeted states, and the special relationship established between European states and some of their former colonies with respect to international trade regime provisions.", "\nStates, though, are not the only actors that have the ability to set and enforce the rules of global governance in ways that directly control the actions of others.", "International organizations sometimes do too, as they can be not only sites of institutional power through which other actors indirectly exercise control but also can exhibit compulsory power.", "91\nThe World Bank's considerable potential for compulsory power vis-\u00e0-vis borrowing states with respect to \u201cdevelopment policy\u201d is illustrative.", "The UN High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR) can shape the life chances of refugees and other displaced peoples.", "92\nIt is partly because of the recognition of the concentration of such resources for compulsory power in international organizations that many scholars and policymakers argue for a deconcentration of decisional authority, a substantial democratization of the institutions of global governance, or mechanisms of accountability.", "93\nEven some materially challenged actors are able to exercise compulsory power in global governance processes.", "Transnational activists, civil society organizations, and international nongovernmental organizations have demonstrated the ability to use rhetorical and symbolic tools, as well as shaming tactics, to get states, multinational corporations, and others to comply with the values and norms that they advance.", "94\nVarious transnational activists successfully used symbolic means to press the Clinton administration to sign the landmine treaty.", "95\nActivists have formed associations and deployed branding and certification techniques to try to use consumer power to compel producers to comply with labor, environmental, and human rights standards.", "96\nAnalysis of global governance needs to be attentive not only to the interactions of actors but also to the constitutive reproduction of the subjects of global social life.", "Gramscians and historical materialists have examined how global institutions help to stabilize and spread global governance that has a markedly liberal and capitalist character.", "97\nAlso prominent here are studies that examine the mutually constituted structural relations of capital and labor\u2014and of core and periphery\u2014in global activities of material production, and how these structures generate a global distribution of material well-being and organize the mechanisms that facilitate, reproduce, regulate, and guard that distribution.", "98\nThe actual workings of global governance, in this view, are reflective of the underlying global class structure, and the ideologies of global governance help to reproduce that structure by fostering a worldview among the exploited classes that either there is no alternative or the current social order is desirable.", "99\nThe concept of productive power as applied to global governance highlights how the discourses and institutions of international relations contingently produce particular kinds of actors with associated social powers, self-understandings, and performative practices.", "Consider the Global Compact, which \u201cengages the private sector to work with the UN, in partnership with international labor and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), to identify, disseminate, and promote good corporate practices based on nine universal principles\u201d that are found in various UN documents.", "100\nBecause this ambitious agenda is undertaken by a slimly funded and staffed unit attached to the secretariat-general's office, it is not an obvious place to look for evidence of power, even if the goal is to alter corporate practices.", "\nYet the architects of the Global Compact imagine two distinctive mechanisms that might foster this development, and these mechanisms are expressions of productive power.", "One, as multinational corporations sign onto a set of (evolving) standards and practices, a discursive space is opened in which various actors are produced as subjects empowered legitimately to comment on their performance.", "Those actors are thereby given social resources that enable them effectively to exercise the compulsory power of shaming corporations into changing their behavior.", "Additionally, the discourse of the Global Compact also aspires to create a new kind of actor\u2014the potentially \u201csocially responsible corporation\u201d\u2014that may adhere to these best practices not because of the manipulation of incentives, but rather because of a new self-understanding.", "101\nIn other words, the discourse is intended to produce a new \u201csocial kind\u201d that will be self-regulating and self-disciplining.", "The production of this new social kind is hypothesized to occur through various mechanisms.", "To begin, they are expected to translate pertinent UN principles, which are legitimated by the international community and draw from broader discourses of liberalism, into lessons learned that can be transformed into best practices.", "To encourage this process, the Global Compact has created a learning network that, ultimately, is \u201cintended to stimulate the internationalization of UN principles into companies' corporate cultures.\u201d", "102\nIbid.\nThis lengthy process will depend on the willingness of corporations to adopt new texts, business models, and practices that ultimately become internalized and identified with the performance of this new social identity, the socially responsible corporation.", "The Global Compact, therefore, illuminates the workings of, and connections between, different forms of power: compulsory power because of the ability of nonstate actors to deploy shaming techniques to alter corporate practices; institutional power because of the role of the UN in establishing new rules that can constrain the behavior of corporations; and productive power because of the attempt to help produce a new social kind of corporate actor.", "\nThe productive power of the Global Compact discourse, although important in its own right, is merely illustrative of the broad significance of productive power in global governance.", "Indeed, all practices of guiding and steering collective outcomes in global social life, with the possible and partial exception of instances of compulsory power effected through relations of raw coercive force and violence, derive from discourses that are productive of the social identities of the actors engaged in them.", "The human rights regime, for example, is an expression of a discursively constituted world populated by subjects normalized as human rights victims, human rights monitors, human rights violators, and human rights prosecutors.", "To analyze global governance processes adequately, then, it is necessary to address systematically the workings of productive power in setting the conditions of meaningful collective action.", "\nUnderstanding the operation of power in multiple forms makes it much more difficult to approach global governance purely in terms of cooperation, coordination, consensus, and normative progress.", "Governance is also a matter of compulsion, institutional bias, privilege, and unequal constraints on action.", "Although these different concepts of power illuminate different ways in which power operates in global governance, there is an important difference between the first two and the last two that affects how we think about governance: the first two concern who governs in global governance, whereas the latter two concern not who governs, but instead how the governing capacities of actors are produced, how those capacities shape governance processes and outcomes, and how bodies of knowledge create subjects that are to be, at least in part, self-regulating and disciplined.", "103\nOur taxonomy does more than simply illuminate the different ways power operates in global governance, for it also encourages scholars to identify connections between these forms.", "\nIf scholars of global governance have tended to underestimate the role of power in any of its forms, there is no such danger regarding the contemporary debate about the existence, nature, and consequences of U.S. empire.", "The U.S. response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, President George W. Bush's 2002 National Security Strategy, and the U.S. occupation of Iraq have caused scholars and pundits to debate whether the United States is an empire.", "104\nThe generic concern is with the informal or formal hierarchical arrangements that maintain the domination of one actor over others.", "See Shaw 2002 , 331\u201332, and Doyle 1986 for a general discussion, and Rosen 2003 for application of the concept to the contemporary United States.", "\nTheir evaluations frequently turn on sometimes loose, but certainly varied, usages of the concept.", "We do not intend to provide the definitive concept of empire and then use that concept to determine whether or not the label applies to the United States.", "Instead, our modest goal is to demonstrate that any systematic discussion of empire must consider power in multiple forms.", "\nMuch of the debate over the existence and nature of American empire pivots off of what we have called compulsory power.", "It could hardly be otherwise.", "A fundamental issue, after all, is the U.S.'s ability and willingness to use its overwhelming concentration of resources to shape directly the actions of others.", "For many observers, the decision to designate the United States as an empire rests on its apparent quest to use coercion and intimidation if and when necessary to develop and sustain its supremacy over other regions and states.", "The emphasis on direct control over others certainly corresponds to the concept of compulsory power, but our concept does raise questions regarding whether the designation of empire should be dependent on intentions and brass-knuckle tactics.", "\nMuch of the recent discussion over the United States as an empire revolves around its intentions.", "After all, although the U.S. global share of material resources has not changed significantly during the past decade, what has changed, according to many, is the Bush administration's determination to use its unrivaled position to strong-arm others and to scare away possible challengers.", "This is one reason why much is made of the Bush administration's 2002 National Security Strategy; it appears to announce loudly and boldly its goal of maintaining an empire in form if not in name.", "But, should intentionality be the metric for determining the existence of empire?", "As we have shown, compulsory power does not hinge on intentionality; it still operates even when those who directly dominate others are not conscious of how their actions are producing unintended effects.", "A state that has no intention of creating or maintaining an empire, per se, might nevertheless exercise directly controlling effects that are nearly identical to those who do.", "To the extent that compulsory power is the key, then, evidence of empire may best be found not in the intentions of the subject but instead in the consequences as viewed from the objects of the empire.", "\nThe concept of compulsory power also questions whether the reliance on coercive means is necessary for the designation of empire.", "Compulsory power concerns the direct control of others, but admits for a range of technologies that allow A to control the behavior and circumstances of B. Consequently, although empires use military means, they also can be expected to use less coercive tactics.", "Doing so might not make them any less of an empire, a point emphasized by Carr in his discussion of the colonial empires.", "105\nThe relevance of thinking about noncoercive mechanisms is quite germane to the tendency, among some scholars, to highlight the perceived willingness of the Bush administration to forgo multilateral means in favor of unilateral instruments as evidence of the bid for empire.", "106\nIn other words, for such analysts it is the shift from a grand strategy revolving around institutional power to one founded primarily on compulsory power that best signals the new status of the United States as empire.", "\nThe backdrop to this argument is an interpretation of what accounts for the longevity of American hegemony after World War II and how it differed from previous hegemonies, including the colonial empires it supplanted.", "The genius of the post\u2013World War II \u201cwise men,\u201d in this way, was to recognize that global rule through coercion was unsustainable, and that it was preferable to establish global institutions that could further American interests and spread American values.", "107\nWhat generated consent for American hegemony was not only agreement over the purpose of American power, but also the construction of multilateral institutions that were conferred legitimacy, constrained American power, and democratized the decision-making process.", "Because these global institutions had some autonomy from the United States and were partly controlled by other states, the United States could not be said to possess them, even though they reflected American interests.", "What separates American hegemony from American empire in this view, therefore, is the willingness to work jointly with others through multilateral institutions and the consent that is attended to them.", "108\nThe Bush administration's decision to shift the weight of American foreign policy from multilateral to unilateral mechanisms provides partial cause for observers to relabel the United States an imperial power.", "\nBut it is important to recognize how American hegemony, even when run through global institutions, still represented an exercise of institutional power.", "The absence of overt conflict does not mean the absence of power; institutions can mobilize bias to serve U.S. purposes and eliminate points of potential opposition to serve U.S. concerns.", "Moreover, global institutions created an asymmetrical distribution of benefits, and the United States has been a prime beneficiary.", "It is partly for this reason that Bacevich claims that the nature of the American empire since World War II has revolved around global institutions that create \u201copen spaces\u201d that the United States can dominate.", "109\nFinally, and most importantly, the United States still exercises power, but now it is indirect and mediated through institutions.", "Any consideration of the American empire, in short, must be attentive to institutional power.", "In this respect, perhaps at stake is not whether the United States is or is not an empire, but rather whether the longevity of that empire is dependent on the willingness to eschew unilateral means of control for indirect institutional means\u2014a point that echoes earlier debates over the nature of informal empires.", "110\nYet to what extent should the debate about the American empire focus exclusively on the specificity of the United States as an actor?", "Compulsory and institutional power directs attention to empire as an extension of a centralized, territorial state that maintains control over others, and thus focuses on the policies of the United States in general and the Bush administration in particular.", "Structural and productive power, however, shift the focus away from particular actors that control, directly or indirectly, others to social relations of constitution.", "In doing so, it directs attention to the underlying social relations that make possible an assumption of imperial power, give meaning to U.S. foreign policy practices, and imagine empire as having a decentralized, even deterritorialized, form.", "\nTo consider structural power in debating the existence or implications of U.S. empire means, first and foremost, exploring the structural constitution of the United States as imperial center.", "This has three interconnected aspects.", "First, the structure of social relations of material production are transnational and create functional and spatial differentiation between a world-economic core and periphery.", "Along these lines, scholars influenced by Marxism and world-system theory generally situate their discussions of U.S. foreign policy in the context of how global capitalism generates a particular set of social positions and practices for the United States in direct relationship to the structurally disadvantaged.", "111\nSuch a consideration frequently includes a claim that a partially deterritorialized global capitalism constitutes the United States as a capitalist state that is bound up with the authoritative rule of and for global capital.", "112\nThis leads to a second observation: because capitalism is global and deterritorialized, so, too, is global rule.", "113\nAlthough the United States might play an important role in regulating the world economy, opening up new territories, and ensuring that rogue countries are disciplined, it works with other states and nonstate actors to maintain and expand global capitalism.", "114\nThird, the regulation of the world economy is accomplished through a mixture of coercion and consent.", "The United States has demonstrated a willingness to use its military power to maintain global economic (and associated sociopolitical) stability.", "It also has worked hard to generate consent\u2014that is, to get those who are structurally disadvantaged because of their position in the world political economy to accept the order of things.", "Accordingly, entering into the debate on U.S. empire through the lens of structural power leads one to a focus on the structural constitution of the conditions of possibility for the Bush administration's policies in relationship to the material, political, and ideological contradictions of capitalism.", "115\nCan the social relations of constitution that generate empire be understood in the more diffuse terms of productive power?", "A most influential, recent, attempt is Hardt and Negri's definition of \u201cempire,\u201d which has been the subject of much critical attention.", "Their argument is that transformative discursive and material processes have produced \u201cempire\u201d: a \u201cdecentered and deterritorializing apparatus of rule that progressively incorporates the entire global realm within its open, expanding, frontiers.\u201d", "116\nWhat has produced this new form of global rule?", "Although they join others in identifying the expansion of global capital, they also locate an important role for the development of Western-backed institutions that maintain more consensual and participatory decision-making practices, new discourses such as human rights, equality, and democracy, and counterhegemonic struggles by labor and others that reflect the desire for \u201cliberation\u201d from the \u201cmodern machines of power.\u201d", "117\nIbid., 43.", "\nEmpire, as they conceive it, is not a system in which tribute, power, and resources flow from the outlying regions to a great metropolitan center, but instead consists of more diffuse networks of hierarchy that generate privilege for some and pacify the multitudes.", "\nHow does this deterritorialized empire constitute the United States?", "Broadly, social discourses might be viewed as productive of the specific subjectivity of the United States in relationship to imperial subjects.", "Some circles, for example, exhibit a growing romantic nostalgia for empire.", "118\nIt is not uncommon to hear the United States being urged to accept the responsibilities and burdens of empire in helping to bring progress to others.", "119\nUSA Today , 6 May 2003, A15.", "\nThis role is to be performed not only by the United States.", "A multiplicity of actors and processes are partially responsible for attempting to bring progress, development, human rights, and the rule of law\u2014in short, civilization\u2014to the non-Western world.", "Along these lines, Judis observed that while there was the formal dismantling of the colonial empires that once played a civilizing mission that stabilized the international order, that role is now shouldered by international organizations.", "120\nNew Republic , 9 June 2003, 19\u201323.", "\nHe proceeded to recommend that the United States continue to use international organizations to perform this civilizing mission, anticipating that they will be better able to bring into being new kinds of actors in world politics.", "Productive power, in this way, works to produce a particular identity for the United States\u2014a responsible and beneficent imperial actor in relation to others (imperial subjects, themselves irresponsible and in need of such help).", "\nIn general, any discussion of American empire should be attentive to all forms of power.", "Certainly there is compulsory power, which is the focus of much of the debate.", "Yet also present is institutional power and how the United States might indirectly control the behavior of others through global institutions.", "These first two approaches share, therefore, a concern with how the United States is able to sustain dominance in international affairs in ways that control, directly and indirectly, the foreign policies and even domestic political arrangements of other states.", "It is possible and desirable, though, to see the American empire as constituted by global social relations.", "Making this move requires a willingness to see the United States at the imperial center, structurally constituted and discursively produced through a complex of imperial relations that are not themselves fully under the control of the U.S. state as actor.", "To fully appreciate how power is embedded in empire, though, requires a willingness to see not only the different forms of power, but also how they combine in different ways to create structured and enduring hierarchies of control and advantage.", "\nPower is a complex and contested concept, in large part because there are important but distinctive ways to understand how social relations shape the fates and choices of actors.", "If international relations scholars have erred in their past attempts to understand power, it is by trying to identify and rely on a single conception.", "But no single concept can capture the forms of power in international politics.", "In order to better enable scholars to see the conceptual variety, we constructed a taxonomy that systematically identifies the different forms of power.", "We use that taxonomy to encourage scholars not to treat these conceptual forms as competing or vying for recognition as the important operation of power in a particular situation.", "Instead, we urge scholars to see how the multiple concepts capture the different and interrelated ways in which actors are enabled and constrained in determining their circumstances.", "\nThe inevitable question, then, is how exactly should we think about the relationship between these forms of power?", "During the past few years, there have been several important statements regarding how scholars should conceptualize the relationship between different substantive theories of international relations, such as neoliberalism and realism, and different social theories, such as constructivism and rationalism.", "121\nJupille, Caporaso, and Checkel suggest several possibilities: incommensurability; competitive testing; sequencing; incorporation (or subsumption); and some type of addition.", "122\nWith respect to analysis of power, we reject the first four in favor of the last.", "\nOne line of argument is that because these different conceptualizations of power derive, in important ways, from different social theoretic commitments, they are incommensurable.", "Because the theoretic foundations are in tension, the best that can be gotten among concepts of power is some form of conceptual pluralism.", "We certainly do not believe that a \u201cmaster\u201d theory of power is possible.", "But there is no social theoretic reason why scholars should not look for areas of connection.", "We also reject a gladiatorial competition between these conceptions; after all, they capture the different ways in which social relations shape and limit actors' ability to determine their fates.", "To permanently reject one in favor of another, therefore, would be to risk overlooking a fundamental dimension of power (and therefore return discussions of power to a state of conceptual myopia).", "\nWe also reject subsumption arguments, on the grounds that they presuppose that there is a foundational element of power that is generative of the other forms.", "We see ways in which compulsory power shapes productive power, and vice-versa; how institutional power shapes compulsory power, and vice-versa; how institutional power shapes structural power, and vice-versa, and on and on.", "So, there is no most basic form.", "On the same grounds, we reject the idea of sequencing because we see no reason to presume that one form of power necessarily and always precedes another.", "To the contrary, in most social contexts all are operating simultaneously, intersecting with and reflecting off of each other.", "\nBecause the taxonomy was designed to encourage scholars to see the different forms of power in international politics and the connections between them, we strongly encourage scholars to imagine how different forms interact to sharpen empirical analysis.", "Different forms of power have different domains of application to the extent that they illuminate different ways in which social relations affect and effect the ability of actors to control their fates.", "123\nFor a related argument, see Baldwin 2002 , 178.\n", "But, as we illustratively suggested in the discussions of global governance and American empire, these different conceptualizations are not only distinct, but also intertwined.", "\n", "Although Carr is routinely considered to be the individual most responsible for establishing the focal conceptualization of power and associating that conceptualization with realism, in our view his work in fact suggests what we are advocating.", "124\nAs expected from someone deeply influenced by Mannheim and Marx, his Twenty Years' Crisis and his analysis of international order exhibit a far-reaching understanding of what power does and how power works.", "He certainly articulated various elements of compulsory power.", "His explicit discussion of power was largely limited to its multiple instruments (for him military force, economic wealth, and public opinion or propaganda) that could be used to overcome resistance from another \u201cpolitical society.\u201d", "Yet he also attended to features of institutional power as he saw how power works through international institutions, including international law, which, in turn, shape the policies of states and help to legitimate and sustain international orders.", "In Carr's view, international organizations, such as the League of Nations and emergent principles of international law, institutionalize the interests of the powerful and work against those of the weak.", "His critique of the League of Nations, therefore, included more than the standard (but false) criticism that its architects and advocates believed that somehow it would magically erase the causes of war; it also included the claim that these international institutions that embodied so-called universal principles, in fact, maintain the international status quo at the expense of some in the service of others.", "The hubris of idealists, Carr argued, is to believe that somehow these international institutions are antidotes to power and represent a positive-sum game.", "Indeed, for Carr, it was the very fact that they mask relations of power that transforms them into stealth weapons of domination.", "\nAs a student of Marx, Carr also saw power as structural\u2014as including social processes that define state interests themselves.", "Drawing inspiration from Marxian theories of false consciousness, for example, he claimed that ideologies such as free trade are part of power politics precisely because they can lead indoctrinated states to consent to new forms of economic relations that insert them into new relations of dependence and exploitation.", "International orders are easier to sustain for the powerful if the dominated submit to their own domination, Carr acknowledged clearly and explicitly.", "Finally, as someone who was influenced by Mannheim, he was keenly aware of how broad discourses such as \u201cprogress,\u201d carried by intellectuals and established institutions, constitute what are acceptable practices and goals (always trying but never quite eradicating power) and shape broader categories of \u201ccivilized\u201d and \u201cuncivilized\u201d states.", "Carr reminds us that power exists at the surface, and also well below; he shows that to understand power means to understand its various forms.", "As scholars of international relations continue to debate the nature, role, and explanatory significance of power, they should recognize the workings of multiple concepts and systematically employ them in their research.", "After all, that is the way Carr would have wanted it.", "\nAbbott , Kenneth , and Duncan Snidal . 1998 .", "Why States Act Through Formal International Organizations .", "Journal of

Yet disciplinary discussions tend to privilege only one, albeit important, form: an actor controlling another to do what that other would not otherwise do. By showing conceptual favoritism, the discipline not only overlooks the different forms of power in international politics, but also fails to develop sophisticated understandings of how global outcomes are produced and how actors are differentially enabled and constrained to determine their fates. We argue that scholars of international relations should employ multiple conceptions of power and develop a conceptual framework that encourages rigorous attention to power in its different forms. We first begin by producing a taxonomy of power. Power is the production, in and through social relations, of effects that shape the capacities of actors to determine their circumstances and fate. This general concept entails two crucial, analytical dimensions: the kinds of social relations through which power works (in relations of interaction or in social relations of constitution); and the specificity of social relations through which effects are produced (specific/direct or diffuse/indirect). These distinctions generate our taxonomy and four concepts of power: compulsory, institutional, structural, and productive. We then illustrate how attention to the multiple forms of power matters for the analysis of global governance and American empire. We conclude by urging scholars to beware of the idea that the multiple concepts are competing, and instead to see connections between them in order to generate more robust understandings of how power works in international politics.\n\u00a9 2005 The IO Foundation and Cambridge University Press\nThe potentially system-defining attacks of September 11, the war on terrorism, and the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq have caused scholars and practitioners to refocus attention on a central concept in international politics: power. If the past is a good predictor of the future, however, debate is likely to be limited conceptually, informed primarily by a realist conception of power\u2014the ability of states to use material resources to get others to do what they otherwise would not. Indeed, this is already happening. Much of the conversation triggered by the U.S. invasion of Iraq, for instance, has focused on unipolarity, the ability of the United States to use its military and economic resources to overcome resistance by states and nonstate actors, and whether other states will balance against or bandwagon with U.S. power. Certainly, any consideration of power in international politics must include such questions. But, Mae West's views notwithstanding, too much of a good thing is not always wonderful. Instead, it can produce theoretical tunnel vision that causes scholars to overlook others forms and effects of power. In this essay we argue that scholars of international relations must work with multiple conceptions of power, suggest how they can accomplish this task, and demonstrate how a consideration of power's polymorphous character will enhance and deepen theoretic understanding of international politics.\nEver since Carr delivered his devastating rhetorical blow against the \u201cutopians\u201d and claimed power for \u201crealism,\u201d the discipline of international relations has tended to treat power as the exclusive province of realism. 1\nAccordingly, a concern with power in international politics is frequently interpreted as a disciplinary attachment to realism. Associated with this tendency, there is a widely accepted conceptualization that is viewed as the only way to understand power: how one state uses its material resources to compel another state to do something it does not want to do. Most introductory texts to international relations cleave to this formulation. Attempts by scholars to operationalize power follow from this definition. 2\nThe substantial literature on the \u201cparadoxes of power\u201d revolves around the disconnect between capabilities and outcomes. 3\nThe disciplinary tendency to associate power with realism and to work primarily with the realist conceptualization partly owes to the fact that rivals to realism typically distance themselves from \u201cpower\u201d considerations. 4\nWe recognize this narrative of the discipline necessarily overlooks other contributions that never pivoted around realism. Later in the article we introduce some of these alternative perspectives.\nThis feature has been especially visible in recent years, as neoliberal institutionalists, liberals, and constructivists have attempted to demonstrate their theoretical salience by demonstrating how \u201cpower\u201d variables are not causally consequential in their explanation of empirical outcomes. Neoliberals have argued how states with convergent interests create international institutions and arrangements that effectively tame (state) power, highlighting processes of social choice and leaving the impression that institutions are the antidote to power. 5\nScholars of liberal international relations theory typically stress that many important international outcomes cannot be adequately explained with reference to power, but instead are better understood by the salutary presence of democracy, particular configurations of domestic interests, liberal values, economic interdependence, or international institutions. 6\nMainstream constructivists, too, have pitted themselves against explanations in terms of power as they have attempted to demonstrate the causal significance of normative structures and processes of learning and persuasion. 7\nBecause these rivals to realism have juxtaposed their arguments to realism's emphasis on power, they have neglected to develop how power is conceptualized and operates within their theories. It could have been otherwise. These theoretical approaches draw from distinct social theoretic traditions that offer critical insights into the forms and effects of power. Although neoliberal institutionalists have tended to highlight how international institutions produce cooperation, they could just as easily have emphasized how institutions shape the bargaining advantage of actors, freeze asymmetries, and establish parameters for change that benefit some at the expense of others. Although liberals have tended to limit their claims to the liberalism of \u201cprogress,\u201d they could have developed the liberalism of \u201cfear\u201d that is more centrally concerned with power. 8\nAlthough constructivists have emphasized how underlying normative structures constitute actors' identities and interests, they have rarely treated these normative structures themselves as defined and infused by power, or emphasized how constitutive effects also are expressions of power. A consequence of this failure to develop alternative conceptualizations of power has been to reinforce the discipline's gravitation toward the default conception as defined by realism. Yet, as famously noted by Gallie, and as repeated by social theorists ever since, power is an essentially contested concept. 9\nIts status owes not only to the desire by scholars to agree to disagree, but also to their awareness that power works in various forms and has various expressions that cannot be captured by a single formulation.\nThe failure to develop alternative conceptualizations of power limits the ability of international relations scholars to understand how global outcomes are produced and how actors are differentially enabled and constrained to determine their fates. One certainly needs to know about the ability of actors to use resources to control the behavior of others. The United States is able to use its military power to compel others to change their foreign policies, and in the contemporary period transnational activists have been able to shame multinational corporations and abusive governments to alter their economic and human rights policies, respectively. Any discussion of power in international politics, then, must include a consideration of how, why, and when some actors have \u201cpower over\u201d others. Yet one also needs to consider the enduring structures and processes of global life that enable and constrain the ability of actors to shape their fates and their futures. The extension of sovereignty from the West to the developing world gave decolonized states the authority to voice their interests and represent themselves, and the emergence of a human rights discourse helped to make possible the very category of human rights activists who give voice to human rights norms. Analysis of power in international relations, then, must include a consideration of how social structures and processes generate differential social capacities for actors to define and pursue their interests and ideals. 10\nThe starting point for opening the conceptual aperture is to identify the critical dimensions that generate different conceptualizations of power. In general terms, power is the production, in and through social relations, of effects that shape the capacities of actors to determine their circumstances and fate. 11\nThis definition slightly amends Scott 2001 , 1\u20132, by pointing explicitly to the operation of power through social relations.\nThe general concept of power that we employ is restricted to the production of particular kinds of effects, namely those on the capacities of actors to determine the conditions of their existence. There is an alternative tradition that sees power as the production of any and all effects and thus as nearly synonymous with causality. 12\nWhat does this alternative tradition keep in that we leave out? It includes social relations of joint action through mutual agreement and interactions in which one actor is able to convince another actor to alter voluntarily and freely its beliefs, interests, or action. Persuasion, then, is social causation but falls outside of our concept of power. So, too, do processes of collective choice that produce joint action. We believe that our circumscribed conception is preferable for two reasons. It better reflects conventional understandings insofar as most scholars interested in power are concerned not simply with how effects are produced, but rather with how these effects work to the advantage of some and the disadvantage of others. We also believe that a focus on differential effects on actor capacities is, empirically, closer to the mark in most social relations. There are moments of completely voluntary persuasion and collective choice, but they are certainly rare and, on close inspection, likely to have uneven effects.\nThis definition informs our argument that conceptual distinctions of power should be represented in terms of two analytical dimensions that are at the core of the general concept: the kinds of social relations through which power works; and the specificity of social relations through which effects on actors' capacities are produced. The first dimension\u2014kinds\u2014refers to the polar positions of social relations of interaction and social relations of constitution. Accordingly, power is either an attribute of particular actors and their interactions or a social process of constituting what actors are as social beings, that is, their social identities and capacities. It can operate, for example, by pointing a gun and issuing commands, or in underlying social structures and systems of knowledge that advantage some and disadvantage others. The second dimension\u2014specificity\u2014concerns the degree to which the social relations through which power works are direct and socially specific or indirect and socially diffuse. It can operate, for example, at the very instant when the gun is brandished, or through diffuse processes embedded in international institutions that establish rules determining who gets to participate in debates and make decisions.\nThese two dimensions generate our taxonomy of four types of power. 13\nOur taxonomy bears some resemblance to, but is distinct from, the conventional \u201cfour faces\u201d approach to power because, we contend, ours is analytically more systematic and precise, and conceptually more general. Digeser nicely summarizes the differences among the four faces in the following way: \u201cUnder the first face of power the central question is, \u2018Who, if anyone, is exercising power?\u2019 Under the second face, \u2018What issues have been mobilized off the agenda and by whom?\u2019 Under the radical conception, \u2018Whose objective interests are being harmed?\u2019 Under the fourth face of power the critical issue is, \u2018What kind of subject is being produced?\u2019\u201d Digeser 1992 , 980. For other summaries of these faces, see Hayward 2000 , chap. 1; and Hay 1997 . Because the four faces developed sequentially through a progressive debate about gaps and absences in prior conceptions, they are not elements in a systematic typology. There are no analytical dimensions that distinguish across all four faces, and the faces overlap and blur into one another.\nEffective taxonomic exercises must try to \u201ccarve nature at its joints\u201d to derive critical, mutually exclusive, and exhaustive distinctions. 14\nToward this end, in the first section below we present our attempt to carve power at its joints. The first type is power as relations of interaction of direct control by one actor over another\u2014Compulsory Power; the second is the control actors exercise indirectly over others through diffuse relations of interaction\u2014Institutional Power; the third is the constitution of subjects' capacities in direct structural relation to one another\u2014Structural Power; and the fourth is the socially diffuse production of subjectivity in systems of meaning and signification\u2014Productive Power. These different conceptualizations provide distinct answers to the fundamental question: in what respects are actors able to determine their fate, and how is that ability limited or enhanced through social relations with others?\nOur taxonomy of power offers several advantages for scholars of international relations theory. First, because it is founded on an explicit and logically systematic decomposition of the general concept of power, it is able to detach discussions of power from the limitations of realism and to encourage scholars to see power's multiple forms. Realism's prominence has contributed to a situation in which scholars are often asked to choose a realist formulation to the neglect of an alternative, or vice versa. 15\nThose who want to expand the conceptualization of power frequently pose theirs as a supplement or an alternative to the realist benchmark. Nye, for example, offers his concept of \u201csoft power\u201d as a counterpoint to the realist emphasis on \u201chard power.\u201d 16\nGruber's concept of \u201cgo-it-alone power\u201d is a modification of realist-influenced approaches. 17\nAlthough these statements usefully expand the scope of the concept, their posing as an alternative to a realist formulation presumes that scholars must choose sides. Because our taxonomy alerts scholars to the fact that multiple forms of power are simultaneously present in international politics, it discourages a presumptive dismissal of other conceptual forms.\nSecond, our approach provides a framework for integration. Taxonomies not only highlight distinct types but also point to connections between them. In other words, the different types should not be seen as necessarily competing concepts, but rather as different forms in which power works in international politics. Our framework, therefore, suggests how scholars might consider how productive power makes some instances of compulsory power possible and legitimate, and, in turn, how compulsory power shapes the terms of meaning that influence how actors see what is possible and desirable.\nThird, our approach represents a decisive advantage over recent contributions to the debate about power in international relations because it incorporates both social relations of interaction and constitution, that is, both \u201cpower over\u201d and \u201cpower to.\u201d Baldwin's influential contributions have relied heavily on a Dahlian formulation\u2014in which A exercises influence over B\u2014and then attempt to incorporate a variety of concerns, including unintended effects and nonmaterial means of influence. 18\nAlthough we agree with him on many points, a fundamental problem is that his actor-oriented approach is incapable of recognizing social relations of constitution and how power inheres in structures and discourses that are not possessed or controlled by any single actor. In a series of important articles, Guzzini has urged international relations scholars to expand their understanding of power. 19\nSee Guzzini 1993 , 2000 , and 2002 .\nAlthough our approaches overlap, they nevertheless differ in two important respects. First, he insists that power be reserved for moments when an actor intentionally produces effects, and that constitutive arguments be understood as \u201cgovernance.\u201d 20\nWe believe that by limiting power to those effects that are intentionally produced, he unnecessarily overlooks the important ways in which effects on the capacities and courses of action available to actors are unintentionally produced through social relations. Also, by treating power as an \u201cagent concept\u201d and creating a new concept, \u201cgovernance,\u201d for those \u201ceffects not due to a particular agent,\u201d he establishes a false dichotomy. 21\nIbid., 443.\nGovernance necessarily entails power; the two are not in conceptual opposition. Our taxonomy, therefore, provides a systematic way of thinking about power in terms of both agency and structure, and thus allows us to incorporate the two elements of his argument in a single integrated conceptual framework.\nLast, but hardly least, our taxonomy does not map precisely onto different theories of international relations. To be sure, each theoretical tradition does favor an understanding of power that corresponds to one or another of the concepts distinguished by our taxonomy. For instance, as noted above, realists work with versions that correspond to compulsory power, and critical theorists typically work with versions that correspond to structural or productive power. But, as we show, it need not be this way. Scholars can and should draw from various conceptualizations of power that are associated with other theoretical schools. We believe that such poaching and cross-fertilization is healthy, needed, and might, in a small way, help scholars move away from perpetual rivalry in disciplinary \u201cism\u201d wars and toward dialogue across theoretical perspectives.\nIn the second section we briefly illustrate why attention to the multiple forms of power affects empirical research through reference to two domains of contemporary theoretical significance\u2014global governance and the debate over American empire. As scholars continue to consider power in international politics, they would do well not to fixate on a single rendition but instead to appreciate how the range of conceptualizations provides the basis for a better, richer, and fuller understanding of the workings of world politics. We conclude on this theme, briefly discussing how such cross-fertilization builds bridges between these concepts, and how scholars might think about the possible relationships.\nPower is the production, in and through social relations, of effects on actors that shape their capacity to control their fate. This concept has two dimensions at its core: (1) the kinds of social relations through which actors' capacities are affected (and effected); and, (2) the specificity of those social relations. Conventionally for social theorists, social relations can be viewed as being broadly of two kinds: relations of interaction among previously constituted social actors; or relations of constitution of actors as particular kinds of social beings. For the second dimension, the crucial distinction is whether the social relations of interaction or constitution through which power works are direct and specific, or indirect and socially diffuse. Below we explore each dimension, then show how the polar positions within each dimension combine to generate our taxonomy of power.\nThe first dimension concerns whether power works in interactions or social constitution. One position on this dimension treats social relations as comprised of the actions of preconstituted social actors toward one another. Here, power works through behavioral relations or interactions, which, in turn, affect the ability of others to control the circumstances of their existence. In these conceptions, power nearly becomes an attribute that an actor possesses and may use knowingly as a resource to shape the actions or conditions of action of others.\nThe other position consists of social relations of constitution. Here, power works through social relations that analytically precede the social or subject positions of actors and that constitute them as social beings with their respective capacities and interests. Constitutive relations cannot be reduced to the attributes, actions, or interactions of pregiven actors. Power, accordingly, is irreducibly social. In other words, constitutive arguments examine how particular social relations are responsible for producing particular kinds of actors. As Wendt puts it, \u201cConstitutive theories \u2026 account for the properties of things by reference to the structures in virtue of which they exist.\u201d 22\nBecause these social relations, in effect, generate different social kinds that have different self- (and other-) understandings and capacities, they have real consequences for an actor's ability to shape the conditions and processes of its existence.\nThis conceptual distinction between power working through social relations of interaction or in social relations of constitution tracks fairly closely with a distinction that frequents the literature on power: \u201cpower over\u201d and \u201cpower to.\u201d Concepts of power rooted in behavior and interaction point to actors' exercise of control over others; they are, then, \u201cpower over\u201d concepts. Concepts of power tied to social relations of constitution, in contrast, consider how social relations define who the actors are and what capacities and practices they are socially empowered to undertake; these concepts are, then, focused on the social production of actors' \u201cpower to.\u201d Some scholars, who examine how constitutive relations make possible certain types of action, focus on how community or collective action are facilitated, while others stress how the social relations of constitution can have a disciplining effect and therefore lead to self-regulation and internalized constraints. 23\nIn either case, though, the concern is with the effect of social relations of constitution on human capacity.\nThis interaction/constitutive distinction also foregrounds particular features of the effects of power. Because power is a property of actors' actions and interactions in behavioral conceptions, there is a strong tendency to see its effects primarily in terms of the behavior of the object of power. In contrast, constitutive power is generally seen as producing effects only in terms of the identities of the occupants of social positions. We want to stress, though, that there is no ontological or epistemological reason why scholars working with one of those concepts need exclude the effects identified by the other. If power works through the actions of specific actors in shaping the ways and the extent to which other actors exercise control over their fate, it can have a variety of effects, ranging from directly affecting the behavior of others to setting the terms of their very self-understandings; behavioral power, then, can have effects on actors' subjectivities and self-understandings. Similarly, if power is in social relations of constitution, it works in fixing what actors are as social beings, which, in turn, defines the meaningful practices in which they are disposed to engage as subjects; constitutive power, then, has effects on behavioral tendencies. Thus scholars examining power through social interaction can see effects on social identities, and those examining power through constitutive relations can see effects on action.\nThe second core analytical dimension concerns how specific\u2014direct and immediate\u2014are the social relations through which power works. Specific relations of power entail some immediate and generally tangible causal or constitutive connection between the subject and the object, or between two subjects. Scholars working with this conception tend to presume that connections between actors are mechanistic, flush with contact, direct, or logically necessary. A consequence of this dependence on social proximity is that it becomes more difficult to observe power in operation the greater is the social distance, the lag between stimulus and effect, or the absence of logical necessity, characterizing these connections.\nThis approach is nicely summarized by Dahl's famous claim that there is \u201cno action at a distance.\u201d 24\nAlthough Dahl intentionally left vague both what counts as \u201cdistance\u201d and the meaning of \u201cconnection\u201d between two actors, he stressed that a relation of power is knowable if and only if there is an observable and traceable connection between A and B. Consequently, while his conceptualization did not preclude the idea of power as spatially, temporally, or socially indirect or diffuse, it did work against it. But it is not only Dahl's and related behavioral conceptions that operate with a specific and direct view of power. Some constitutive analyses do so as well. For example, scholars such as Bhaskar, Giddens, and Wendt point to the structured relationship of co-constitution between social roles or structural positions (such as Marxian class categories), and how their social capacities are defined in direct and specific relation to other roles or positions. 25\nIn this way, they identify a direct and specific relationship between the social positions, which are jointly constituted structurally. 26\nAlso see Isaac 1987 .\nThis is how Marxist approaches consider, for instance, the co-constitutive social relations of capital and labor in capitalism; the capitalist class structure generates distinctive social capacities and interests of the social positions of capital and labor. In general, specific relations concern the direct causal/constitutive connection between actors that are in physical, historical, or social positional proximity.\nOther approaches see power in indirect and socially diffuse relations. Instead of insisting that power work through an immediate, direct, and specific relationship, these conceptions allow for the possibility of power even if the connections are detached and mediated, or operate at a physical, temporal, or social distance. Scholars that locate power in the rules of institutions, whether formal or informal, frequently trace its operation to such indirect mechanisms. Those examining concrete institutions have shown how evolving rules and decision-making procedures can shape outcomes in ways that favor some groups over others; these effects can operate over time and at a distance, and often in ways that were not intended or anticipated by the architects of the institution. 27\nSimilarly, scholars influenced by poststructuralism examine how historically and contingently produced discourses shape the subjectivities of actors; the very reason for genealogical and discourse-analytic methods is to demonstrate how systems of knowledge and discursive practices produce subjects through social relations that are quite indirect, socially diffuse, and temporally distant. 28\nFor instance, students of gender, race, and nation routinely recognize how socially diffuse discourses, and not isolated, direct, and proximate actions, produce the subjects of the modern world. 29\nThese two core dimensions\u2014the kinds of social relations through which power works, and the specificity of the social relations through which power's effects are produced\u2014generate a fourfold taxonomy of power as illustrated in Figure 1 . Each cell in Figure 1 represents a different conceptual type. Compulsory power exists in the direct control of one actor over the conditions of existence and/or the actions of another. Institutional power exists in actors' indirect control over the conditions of action of socially distant others. Structural power operates as the constitutive relations of a direct and specific\u2014hence, mutually constituting\u2014kind. Productive power works through diffuse constitutive relations to produce the situated social capacities of actors.\nTaxonomy of power\nBecause concepts of power are partly distinguished by the conceptualized relationship between agency and structure, our taxonomy relates to the agent-structure duality to the extent that the generic concern is with the relationship between social context and human action. We want to stress, though, that because each type of power has at least an implicit view of both agency and structure, none simply reflects an entirely agentic or structural perspective (to the neglect of the other). Nevertheless, they do vary in specific ways. Compulsory (and, to a lesser degree, institutional) power emphasizes agency to the point where structure becomes the context in which A's actions and B's reactions are set and constrained, thereby leaning heavily on agency and treating structure as constraint. In contrast, concepts of structural and productive power emphasize structure relative to purposeful agency, even while recognizing that meaningful practices, and hence, human agency, are essential in producing, reproducing and possibly transforming these structures.\nThis first concept of power focuses on a range of relations between actors that allow one to shape directly the circumstances or actions of another. Some of the most famous and widely used definitions of power fall under this concept. Weber defined power as the \u201cprobability that one actor within a social relationship will be in a position to carry out his own will despite resistance, regardless of the basis on which this probability exists.\u201d 30\nSimilarly, Blau defined it as the influence over behavior through negative sanctions. 31\nIn terms of sheer influence, especially for scholars of international relations, arguably no definition surpasses that of Dahl's earliest formulation. 32\nDahl 1957 , 202\u20133. As Baldwin 2002 , 177, claimed, \u201cnone rivals this one in widespread acceptability.\u201d Dahl modified his views in later statements. See Dahl and Stinebrickner 2003 .\nFor him, power is best understood as the ability of A to get B to do what B otherwise would not do. Dahl's concept has three defining features. One, there is intentionality on the part of Actor A. What counts is that A wants B to alter its actions in a particular direction. If B alters its actions under the mistaken impression that A wants it to, then that would not count as power because it was not A's intent that B do so. Two, there must be a conflict of desires, to the extent that B now feels compelled to alter its behavior. A and B want different outcomes, and B loses. Three, A is successful because it has material and ideational resources at its disposal that lead B to alter its actions. Although theorists have debated whether the relevant resources are an intrinsic property of actors or are better understood as part of a relationship of dependence between two or more actors, the underlying claim is that identifiable resources that are controlled and intentionally deployed by actors are what counts for thinking about power. 33\nFor the first claim, see Emerson 1962 ; Blau 1964 ; and Wrong 1988 . For the second, see Laswell and Kaplan 1980 ; and Russell 1986 , 19\u201320.\nAlthough Dahl's initial conceptualization usefully illustrates the concept of compulsory power, our taxonomy highlights how compulsory power need not hinge on intentionality. 34\nOn this point we agree with Baldwin 2002 , and disagree with Guzzini 1993 .\nCompulsory power is present whenever A's actions control B's actions or circumstances, even if unintentionally. As Bachrach and Baratz argue, power still exists even when those who dominate are not conscious of how their actions are producing unintended effects. 35\nThe victims of \u201ccollateral damage\u201d of bombing campaigns certainly experience the power of the deliverer even if it was not the latter's intention to create such damage. Because power is the production of effects, arguably compulsory power is best understood from the perspective of the recipient, not the deliverer, of the direct action.\nCompulsory power has significantly influenced thinking about power in international politics. 36\nSee Claude 1962 ; Knorr 1973 ; and Baldwin 1989 and 2002 . For a discussion and critique of power-centered analysis, see Vasquez 1998 ; and Guzzini 1993 and 1998 .\nSpecifically, its emphasis on control by identifiable actors over the objections of other actors through deployment (even if only symbolically) of resources informs much of realist thought. For many scholars\u2014both realists and their critics\u2014to study power in international relations is to consider how one state is able to use material resources to advance its interests in direct opposition to the interests of another state. This approach steers attention to the great powers. Yet major powers are not alone in the ability to deploy resources to overcome the objections of actors. Multinational corporations can use their control over capital to shape the foreign economic policies of developing states, as well as global economic policies. Nonstate networks and groups sometimes conduct campaigns of unconventional warfare that terrorize entire populations.\nCompulsory power is not limited to material resources; it also entails symbolic and normative resources. 37\nNongovernmental organizations have deployed normative resources to compel targeted states to alter their policies through a strategy of shaming. 38\nDrawing from the work of Goffman and Bourdieu, Barnett argued that Arab states have used symbolic sanctions to alter the behavior of other Arab states on a range of issues. 39\nLess powerful members of the Security Council are able to use legal norms to constrain the actions of the powerful. 40\nInternational organizations are able to use their expert, moral, delegated, and rational-legal authority as a resource to compel state and nonstate actors to change their behavior. 41\nIn general, scholars should be attentive to a range of technologies and mechanisms as they consider how one actor is able to directly control the conditions of behavior of another actor. In fact, there is a long pedigree for doing just that. Carr began this tradition when he distinguished between military, economic, and propaganda power, corresponding respectively to the threatened or actual deployment of violence, nonviolent sanctions, and normative pressure. 42\nThese distinctions do usefully refine one's understanding of how compulsory power works, but from the perspective of our taxonomy these are refinements of a specific concept of power, compulsory power, and not distinct concepts, per se.\nWhereas compulsory power entails the direct control of one actor of the conditions and actions of another, institutional power is actors' control of others in indirect ways. Specifically, the conceptual focus here is on the formal and informal institutions that mediate between A and B, as A, working through the rules and procedures that define those institutions, guides, steers, and constrains the actions (or nonactions) and conditions of existence of others. 43\nWe caution against two possible, but inapt, connotations of institutional power: the power of institutions as actors in their own right (for example, the World Bank's power over borrowing countries); and the effect of institutions in constituting social subjects (for example, the institution of sovereignty affects the constitution of state subjects). The former is best understood as compulsory power and the latter as either structural or productive power. Institutional power, in other words, does not include any and all aspects of power by, in, and through institutions. Instead, it is preconstituted actors exercising control over others indirectly through institutions.\nThus compulsory and institutional power differ in the following ways. To begin, whereas compulsory power typically rests on the resources that are deployed by A to exercise power directly over B, A cannot necessarily be said to \u201cpossess\u201d the institution that constrains and shapes B. It is certainly possible that a dominant actor maintains total control over an institution, which, in turn, lords over other actors. If so, then it is arguably best to conceptualize the institution as possessed by the actor, that is, as an instrument of compulsory power. But rare is the institution that is completely dominated by one actor. Instead, it is much more likely that an institution has some independence from specific resource-laden actors. 44\nThis provides the principal analytical grounds for making the move to the institutional context.\nSecond, the recognition of the importance of institutional arrangements highlights that A and B are socially removed from\u2014only indirectly related to\u2014one another. This distance can be spatial or temporal. Spatially, A's actions affect the behavior or conditions of others only through institutional arrangements (such as decisional rules, formalized lines of responsibility, divisions of labor, and structures of dispersed dependence); power is no longer a matter of A's direct effect on B, but works instead through socially extended, institutionally diffuse relations. In other words, A does not \u201cpossess\u201d the resources of power, but because A stands in a particular relation to the relevant institutional arrangements, its actions exercise power over B. Temporally, institutions established at one point in time can have ongoing and unintended effects at a later point. Long-standing institutions represent frozen configurations of privilege and bias that can continue to shape the future choices of actors. Third, analyses of institutional power necessarily consider the decisions that were not made (the proverbial dogs that do not bark) because of institutional arrangements that limit some opportunities and bias directions, particularly of collective action. 45\nBachrach and Baratz 1962 and 1963 . Compulsory power, too, can entail \u201cnondecision.\u201d For example, failing even to consider the possibility of distributing certain medications to populations in dire need of them can be a form of direct control of A over B.\nInstitutional arrangements can shape the agenda-setting process in ways that eliminate those very issues that are points of conflict.\nInternational relations scholars have developed a range of arguments that examine how formal and informal institutions enable some actors to shape the behavior or circumstances of socially distant others. The literature on formal and informal agenda setting focuses on who sets the agenda and how that agenda omits certain possibilities. 46\nAlso of relevance is the literature that highlights traditional notions of dependence; that is, how material processes limit the choices available to dependent actors. Hirschman, for example, famously argued that market forces can create dependent relationships that limit the weaker actor's choices. 47\nHirschman 1945 . Aspects of Hirschman's argument, of course, emphasize direct relations of dependence between two countries, and hence, compulsory power.\nAlong similar lines, Keohane and Nye considered how enduring systems of exchange and interdependence can be media of power. 48\nAlso prominent here are neoliberal institutional approaches that focus on the behavioral constraints and governing biases of institutions. The general concern is with durable solutions to games of interdependent choice and how institutions help to solve coordination and cooperation dilemmas. Yet the institutional rules that establish a particular focal point also serve to generate unequal leverage in determining collective outcomes. In short, the institutions that are established to help actors achieve mutually acceptable, even Pareto-superior, outcomes also create \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers,\u201d to the extent that the ability to use the institution and, accordingly, collective rewards\u2014material and normative\u2014are unevenly distributed long into the future and beyond the intentions of the creators. 49\nIndeed, many scholars examining how international institutions look from the vantage point of the weak tend to stress those very features. 50\nSee Murphy 1984 ; and Ayoob 1995 , chap. 7.\nStructural power concerns the structures\u2014or, more precisely, the co-constitutive, internal relations of structural positions\u2014that define what kinds of social beings actors are. It produces the very social capacities of structural, or subject, positions in direct relation to one another, and the associated interests, that underlie and dispose action. This makes this type of power quite different from institutional power. Whereas institutional power focuses on differential constraints on action, structural power concerns the determination of social capacities and interests. This important difference owes chiefly to their different theoretic understandings of structure. Scholars focusing on institutional power usually define institutions and structure in almost interchangeable terms, as sets of rules, procedures, and norms that constrain the action of already-constituted actors with fixed preferences. Scholars focusing on structural power conceive structure as an internal relation\u2014that is, a direct constitutive relation such that the structural position, A, exists only by virtue of its relation to structural position, B. 51\nThe classic examples here are master-slave and capital-labor relations. From this perspective, the kinds of social beings that are mutually constituted are directly or internally related; that is, the social relational capacities, subjectivities, and interests of actors are directly shaped by the social positions that they occupy.\nStructural power shapes the fates and conditions of existence of actors in two critical ways. One, structural positions do not necessarily generate equal social privileges; instead structures allocate differential capacities, and typically differential advantages, to different positions. Capital-labor and master-slave relations are obvious examples of how social structures constitute unequal social privileges and capacities. Two, the social structure not only constitutes actors and their capacities, it also shapes their self-understanding and subjective interests. The consequence is that structures that distribute asymmetric privileges also affect the interests of actors, often leaving them willing to \u201caccept their role in the existing order of things.\u201d 52\nIn other words, structural power can work to constrain some actors from recognizing their own domination. To the degree that it does, actors' self-understandings and dispositions for action serve to reproduce, rather than to resist, the differential capacities and privileges of structure. As Steven Lukes observed: \u201cis it not the supreme and most insidious exercise of power to prevent people, to whatever degree, from having grievances shaping their perceptions, cognitions, and preferences in such a way that they accept their role in the existing order of things?\u201d 53\nIbid. It is possible to construct a compulsory power answer to this question. For instance, A might act to alter the beliefs of B, thereby making it easier to control B, as it is always easier to maintain a social order through consent than through coercion. Baldwin 2002 , 179, gives the example of brainwashing. Related is Hurrell and Woods's 1995 concept of coercive socialization and Ikenberry and Kupchan's 1990 notion of hegemonic power.\nIn this way, structural power operates even when there are no instances of A acting to exercise control over B. 54\nThis approach relates to the distinction between objective and subjective interests. See Benton 1981 .\nVarious international relations scholars forward arguments that have strong shades of structural power. Most obviously, Marxist-influenced scholars gravitate toward this concept. 55\nMarxists are not alone in emphasizing structural power. Bourdieu 2001 focuses on the global importance of masculine domination produced through the structure of patriarchy. Strange 1989 developed a non-Marxian approach to what she calls structural power.\nExplicitly following Lukes and Gramsci, Gill and Law argue that while power exists in coercion and institutional arrangements, to understand the workings of the global capitalist economy requires recognition of global production relations as constitutive structure. 56\nFor them, as well as other Gramscians and historical materialists, the structure of global capitalism substantially determines the capacities and resources of actors. 57\nIt also shapes their ideology\u2014that is, the interpretive system through which they understand their interests and desires. This ideology, according to scholars like Gill and Law, is hegemonic in that it serves the objective interests of the capitalists and their fellow travelers at the direct expense of the objective (but not, then, recognized) interests of the world's producing classes, thereby disposing action toward the reproduction, rather than the substantial transformation, of the structure and its relations of domination. In the same spirit, Cox draws on Machiavelli's notion of power as a centaur: it operates overtly to the extent that one actor will manipulate strategic constraints for the purposes of controlling the actions of actors (the beast of compulsory and institutional power), and it operates covertly to the extent that it generates the social powers, values, and interpretations of reality that deeply structure internal control (the man that is structural power). 58\nWorld-systems theorists also draw on this conception of power to the extent that they argue that: structures of production generate particular kinds of states identified as core, semiperiphery, and periphery; the positions in the world-system generate commensurate sets of identities and interests; and those in the subordinate positions adopt (ideologically generated) conceptions of interest that support their own domination and their lesser position in that world-system. 59\nBecause many constructivists draw from structurally oriented theories of sociology, they also are sometimes attentive to structural power. Wendt, for instance, argues that \u201ca key aspect of any cultural form is its role structure, the configuration of subject positions that shared ideas make available to its holders.\u201d 60\nHe proceeds to note that the role structures can contain functional differentiation and thus generate differential privileges and capacities to the occupants of these roles. 61\nAlthough constructivists who draw from sociological institutionalism do not usually adopt a notion of structure as a set of internal relations, they make a related conceptual move, suggesting a hint of structural power, to the extent that rules, which often are associated with and can generate roles, produce the identities and interests of actors. 62\nThis tendency is especially evident among those associated with the world polity school. Boli and Thomas, for instance, argue that there is a world authority structure, a set of fundamental principles, that constitutes who are the actors of world politics, what are their identities, what are their expressive purposes, and what are their differential capacities. Consequently, they argue that the institutionalization of a world authority structure that is organized around rational-legal values increasingly privileges the voices of international nongovernmental organizations. 63\nProductive power and structural power overlap in several important respects. Both are attentive to constitutive social processes that are, themselves, not controlled by specific actors, but that are effected only through the meaningful practices of actors. Both concern how the social capacities of actors are socially produced, and how these processes shape actors' self-understandings and perceived interests. Additionally, neither concept of power depends on the existence of expressed conflict (although resistance is at the heart of the dynamics of change of them).\nYet structural and productive power differ in a critical respect: whereas the former works through direct structural relations, the latter entails more generalized and diffuse social processes. Specifically, and at the risk of gross simplification, structural power is structural constitution, that is, the production and reproduction of internally related positions of super- and subordination, or domination, that actors occupy. Productive power, by contrast, is the constitution of all social subjects with various social powers through systems of knowledge and discursive practices of broad and general social scope. Conceptually, the move is away from structures, per se, to systems of signification and meaning (which are structured, but not themselves structures), and to networks of social forces perpetually shaping one another. In that respect, attention to productive power looks beyond (or is post-) structures.\nThis difference between direct and diffuse social relations of constitution has two important implications for thinking about productive power. First, productive power concerns discourse, the social processes and the systems of knowledge through which meaning is produced, fixed, lived, experienced, and transformed. 64\nDiscourses are understood here not as dialogues among specific actors or in terms of Habermasian notions of communicative action. Instead, the concept refers to how \u201cmicrofields\u201d or the quotidian \u201cdefine the (im)possible, the (im)probable, the natural, the normal, what counts as a problem.\u201d 65\nIn this way, discourses are sites of social relations of power because they situate ordinary practices of life and define the social fields of action that are imaginable and possible. 66\nSecond, discursive processes and practices produce social identities and capacities as they give meaning to them. In Foucault's archetypical formulation, humans are not only power's intended targets, but also its effects. 67\nDiscourse, therefore, is socially productive for all subjects, constituting the subjectivity of all social beings of diverse kinds with their contingent, though not entirely fluid, identities, practices, rights, responsibilities, and social capacities. 68\nProductive power, therefore, differs from structural power in its approach to subjectivity. Because structural power concerns the co-constitution of subjects, it typically envisions hierarchical and binary relations of domination that work to the advantage of those structurally empowered, to the disadvantage of the socially weak. In contrast, productive power concerns the boundaries of all social identity, and the capacity and inclination for action for the socially advantaged and disadvantaged alike, as well as the myriad social subjects that are not constituted in binary hierarchical relationships. 69\nFor a range of statements that address these differences, see Ball 1992 ; Barnes 1988 ; Benton 1981 ; Wartenberg 1992 ; and Isaac 1987 .\nProductive power, in this way, refuses\nto assume that some essence is at the root of human subjectivity, [and raises] the possibility that every ordering of social relations, and every ordering of social selves (every inter- and intrasubjective power relation) bears some cost in the form of violence it does to \u201cwhat it might be \u2018in the self and in the social world.\u2019 \u201d 70\nHayward 2000 , 6 (emphasis in the original).\nIn general, the bases and workings of productive power are the socially existing and, hence, historically contingent and changing understandings, meanings, norms, customs, and social identities that make possible, limit, and are drawn on for action. 71\nIbid., 30.\nSome of the best examples of the analysis of productive power in international relations refer to the discursive production of the subjects, the fixing of meanings, and the terms of action, of world politics. One question concerns the kinds of subjects that are produced. Basic categories of classification, like \u201ccivilized,\u201d \u201crogue,\u201d \u201cEuropean,\u201d \u201cunstable,\u201d \u201cWestern,\u201d and \u201cdemocratic\u201d states, are representative of productive power, as they generate asymmetries of social capacities. 72\nEven categories such as \u201cweapons of mass destruction\u201d can evolve in unexpected ways and stabilize meanings that constrain policy. 73\nSee Litwak 2002 ; and The New Republic , 7 October 2002, 22.\nA related theme is how the \u201cother\u201d comes to be defined and how that definition is associated with the practices and policies that are possible, imaginable, permissible, and desirable. 74\nAlso, socially contested efforts to set and fix meanings can be expressive of productive power. 75\nA particular discourse of development orients action in one direction and away from others. 76\nThe gendered categories of \u201ccivilian\u201d and \u201ccombatant\u201d in international humanitarian law have real consequences for those on the ground, protecting some while putting others at the risk of death. 77\nThus to attend to the analysis of productive power is to focus on how diffuse and contingent social processes produce particular kinds of subjects, fix meanings and categories, and create what is taken for granted and the ordinary of world politics.\nThe four concepts of power offer distinctive views about how actors' abilities to shape and set the conditions of their existence and action are affected and effected in international relations. Although each concept offers important insights into how power operates, a full accounting of power requires a consideration of its multiple forms operating in relation to each other. Our taxonomy does more than alert scholars to the different forms of power, though, for it also encourages a consideration of their conjunction. To demonstrate the value of our taxonomy for seeing the distinctive forms and the linkages between them, we consider two major issues in global politics\u2014global governance, and American empire.\nScholars of global governance often define it as the institutionalized coordination or collaboration of people's and states' activities in ways that achieve more desirable\u2014positive sum\u2014outcomes. 78\nBecause of this tendency to tie global governance to institutionalized cooperation, coordination of convergent interests, and the production of collective goods, many scholars diminish or overlook the role of power. 79\nThis argument is developed in Hurrell 2005 .\nYet governance is part of a family of concepts, including control, guidance, and steering, which are also elements of the family of \u201cpower\u201d concepts. Therefore, the scholarly tendency to slight how power operates in global governance is conceptually and theoretically problematic. Power is central to global governance, and our taxonomy highlights the multiple and interconnected ways in which it operates.\nInternational institutions, formal and informal, are often understood to be at the heart of global governance. Relations of cooperation and coordination, practices of international law, and the processes of collective action that they entail, are effected in and through institutions. Institutional power thus provides a reasonable conceptual starting point for examining power in global governance, and shapes global governance in at least three ways.\nFirst, any concern with global governance must consider what issues are of concern and which issues are not. For decades after World War II, issues of human rights, women's rights, and children's rights never made it on the UN agenda and thus were never discussed or even deemed worthy of \u201cgovernance.\u201d That is no longer the case. 80\nToday, issues of collective responsibility for adequate employment or a livable wage for all people are institutionally excluded. One major goal of proponents of the new international economic order (NIEO) was to transform the issues that were debated and regulated in the global economy. 81\nAgendas enable some actors to further their interests and ideals, to exercise control over others, and to limit the abilities of actors to engage in effective collective action.\nSecond, a consideration of institutional power also exposes the governing biases of institutions. As we noted in the conceptual discussion above, the institutional rules that establish a particular focal point also serve to generate unequal leverage or influence in determining collective outcomes. 82\nIn short, the institutions that are established to help actors achieve pareto-superior outcomes also create \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers,\u201d to the extent that the ability to use the institution and, accordingly, collective rewards are unevenly distributed. 83\nThis institutional context, moreover, lingers into the future, thus constraining action in ways that might not have been intended but nevertheless limit choice and shape action. 84\nThis is precisely the point of considerable contemporary criticism of a number of formal organizations involved in governing the global economy, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 85\nRecent analyses of the international refugee regime also have noted how legal and normative changes have potentially come at the expense of refugees. 86\nThird, also consistent with the biases of institutions is the ability of great powers to establish international institutions and arrangements to further or preserve their interests and positions of advantage into the future, even as they do not directly or fully control those future arrangements. Gruber's concept and application of \u201cgo-it-alone\u201d power suggests how strong states undertake a course of action that subsequently shapes future outcomes for others, and that weak states go along with an agreement that may actually leave them worse off, because to oppose the inevitable will only cost them more in the long run. 87\nIn short, for Gruber, weaker states are damned if they do and doubly damned if they do not. Significantly, it is less important that the outcome is willfully intended than that it is an effect of asymmetrical ability to shape the context of choice or decision. Strange argued that while American power as defined by material resources might be in decline (at the time of her writing), the United States is the epicenter of a transnational empire that gives it the ability to shape security, financial, productive, and knowledge structures, which, in turn, operate to U.S. advantage and foreclose opportunities to other countries. 88\nIkenberry has argued that liberal great powers have attempted to use their positions of power after war to establish international governance mechanisms that simultaneously preserve and diffuse their power. 89\nIn sum, the institutional core of global governance, while seemingly resting on the production of joint gains through cooperation or coordination, also entails the substantial operation of institutional power.\nBut institutional power, alone, does not tell the whole story. The example of great powers attempting to shape institutions suggests more traditional senses of \u201cpower struggles,\u201d which directs attention to compulsory power. Here, most obviously, the concern is with how states, and largely the great powers, are able to determine the content and direction of global governance by using their decisive material advantages not only to determine what areas are to be governed, but also to directly \u201ccoordinate\u201d the actions of lesser powers so that they align with their interests. 90\nOther examples of this form of power include the U.S. efforts to determine the terms of the International Criminal Court by manipulating incentives for particular targeted states, and the special relationship established between European states and some of their former colonies with respect to international trade regime provisions.\nStates, though, are not the only actors that have the ability to set and enforce the rules of global governance in ways that directly control the actions of others. International organizations sometimes do too, as they can be not only sites of institutional power through which other actors indirectly exercise control but also can exhibit compulsory power. 91\nThe World Bank's considerable potential for compulsory power vis-\u00e0-vis borrowing states with respect to \u201cdevelopment policy\u201d is illustrative. The UN High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR) can shape the life chances of refugees and other displaced peoples. 92\nIt is partly because of the recognition of the concentration of such resources for compulsory power in international organizations that many scholars and policymakers argue for a deconcentration of decisional authority, a substantial democratization of the institutions of global governance, or mechanisms of accountability. 93\nEven some materially challenged actors are able to exercise compulsory power in global governance processes. Transnational activists, civil society organizations, and international nongovernmental organizations have demonstrated the ability to use rhetorical and symbolic tools, as well as shaming tactics, to get states, multinational corporations, and others to comply with the values and norms that they advance. 94\nVarious transnational activists successfully used symbolic means to press the Clinton administration to sign the landmine treaty. 95\nActivists have formed associations and deployed branding and certification techniques to try to use consumer power to compel producers to comply with labor, environmental, and human rights standards. 96\nAnalysis of global governance needs to be attentive not only to the interactions of actors but also to the constitutive reproduction of the subjects of global social life. Gramscians and historical materialists have examined how global institutions help to stabilize and spread global governance that has a markedly liberal and capitalist character. 97\nAlso prominent here are studies that examine the mutually constituted structural relations of capital and labor\u2014and of core and periphery\u2014in global activities of material production, and how these structures generate a global distribution of material well-being and organize the mechanisms that facilitate, reproduce, regulate, and guard that distribution. 98\nThe actual workings of global governance, in this view, are reflective of the underlying global class structure, and the ideologies of global governance help to reproduce that structure by fostering a worldview among the exploited classes that either there is no alternative or the current social order is desirable. 99\nThe concept of productive power as applied to global governance highlights how the discourses and institutions of international relations contingently produce particular kinds of actors with associated social powers, self-understandings, and performative practices. Consider the Global Compact, which \u201cengages the private sector to work with the UN, in partnership with international labor and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), to identify, disseminate, and promote good corporate practices based on nine universal principles\u201d that are found in various UN documents. 100\nBecause this ambitious agenda is undertaken by a slimly funded and staffed unit attached to the secretariat-general's office, it is not an obvious place to look for evidence of power, even if the goal is to alter corporate practices.\nYet the architects of the Global Compact imagine two distinctive mechanisms that might foster this development, and these mechanisms are expressions of productive power. One, as multinational corporations sign onto a set of (evolving) standards and practices, a discursive space is opened in which various actors are produced as subjects empowered legitimately to comment on their performance. Those actors are thereby given social resources that enable them effectively to exercise the compulsory power of shaming corporations into changing their behavior. Additionally, the discourse of the Global Compact also aspires to create a new kind of actor\u2014the potentially \u201csocially responsible corporation\u201d\u2014that may adhere to these best practices not because of the manipulation of incentives, but rather because of a new self-understanding. 101\nIn other words, the discourse is intended to produce a new \u201csocial kind\u201d that will be self-regulating and self-disciplining. The production of this new social kind is hypothesized to occur through various mechanisms. To begin, they are expected to translate pertinent UN principles, which are legitimated by the international community and draw from broader discourses of liberalism, into lessons learned that can be transformed into best practices. To encourage this process, the Global Compact has created a learning network that, ultimately, is \u201cintended to stimulate the internationalization of UN principles into companies' corporate cultures.\u201d 102\nIbid.\nThis lengthy process will depend on the willingness of corporations to adopt new texts, business models, and practices that ultimately become internalized and identified with the performance of this new social identity, the socially responsible corporation. The Global Compact, therefore, illuminates the workings of, and connections between, different forms of power: compulsory power because of the ability of nonstate actors to deploy shaming techniques to alter corporate practices; institutional power because of the role of the UN in establishing new rules that can constrain the behavior of corporations; and productive power because of the attempt to help produce a new social kind of corporate actor.\nThe productive power of the Global Compact discourse, although important in its own right, is merely illustrative of the broad significance of productive power in global governance. Indeed, all practices of guiding and steering collective outcomes in global social life, with the possible and partial exception of instances of compulsory power effected through relations of raw coercive force and violence, derive from discourses that are productive of the social identities of the actors engaged in them. The human rights regime, for example, is an expression of a discursively constituted world populated by subjects normalized as human rights victims, human rights monitors, human rights violators, and human rights prosecutors. To analyze global governance processes adequately, then, it is necessary to address systematically the workings of productive power in setting the conditions of meaningful collective action.\nUnderstanding the operation of power in multiple forms makes it much more difficult to approach global governance purely in terms of cooperation, coordination, consensus, and normative progress. Governance is also a matter of compulsion, institutional bias, privilege, and unequal constraints on action. Although these different concepts of power illuminate different ways in which power operates in global governance, there is an important difference between the first two and the last two that affects how we think about governance: the first two concern who governs in global governance, whereas the latter two concern not who governs, but instead how the governing capacities of actors are produced, how those capacities shape governance processes and outcomes, and how bodies of knowledge create subjects that are to be, at least in part, self-regulating and disciplined. 103\nOur taxonomy does more than simply illuminate the different ways power operates in global governance, for it also encourages scholars to identify connections between these forms.\nIf scholars of global governance have tended to underestimate the role of power in any of its forms, there is no such danger regarding the contemporary debate about the existence, nature, and consequences of U.S. empire. The U.S. response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, President George W. Bush's 2002 National Security Strategy, and the U.S. occupation of Iraq have caused scholars and pundits to debate whether the United States is an empire. 104\nThe generic concern is with the informal or formal hierarchical arrangements that maintain the domination of one actor over others. See Shaw 2002 , 331\u201332, and Doyle 1986 for a general discussion, and Rosen 2003 for application of the concept to the contemporary United States.\nTheir evaluations frequently turn on sometimes loose, but certainly varied, usages of the concept. We do not intend to provide the definitive concept of empire and then use that concept to determine whether or not the label applies to the United States. Instead, our modest goal is to demonstrate that any systematic discussion of empire must consider power in multiple forms.\nMuch of the debate over the existence and nature of American empire pivots off of what we have called compulsory power. It could hardly be otherwise. A fundamental issue, after all, is the U.S.'s ability and willingness to use its overwhelming concentration of resources to shape directly the actions of others. For many observers, the decision to designate the United States as an empire rests on its apparent quest to use coercion and intimidation if and when necessary to develop and sustain its supremacy over other regions and states. The emphasis on direct control over others certainly corresponds to the concept of compulsory power, but our concept does raise questions regarding whether the designation of empire should be dependent on intentions and brass-knuckle tactics.\nMuch of the recent discussion over the United States as an empire revolves around its intentions. After all, although the U.S. global share of material resources has not changed significantly during the past decade, what has changed, according to many, is the Bush administration's determination to use its unrivaled position to strong-arm others and to scare away possible challengers. This is one reason why much is made of the Bush administration's 2002 National Security Strategy; it appears to announce loudly and boldly its goal of maintaining an empire in form if not in name. But, should intentionality be the metric for determining the existence of empire? As we have shown, compulsory power does not hinge on intentionality; it still operates even when those who directly dominate others are not conscious of how their actions are producing unintended effects. A state that has no intention of creating or maintaining an empire, per se, might nevertheless exercise directly controlling effects that are nearly identical to those who do. To the extent that compulsory power is the key, then, evidence of empire may best be found not in the intentions of the subject but instead in the consequences as viewed from the objects of the empire.\nThe concept of compulsory power also questions whether the reliance on coercive means is necessary for the designation of empire. Compulsory power concerns the direct control of others, but admits for a range of technologies that allow A to control the behavior and circumstances of B. Consequently, although empires use military means, they also can be expected to use less coercive tactics. Doing so might not make them any less of an empire, a point emphasized by Carr in his discussion of the colonial empires. 105\nThe relevance of thinking about noncoercive mechanisms is quite germane to the tendency, among some scholars, to highlight the perceived willingness of the Bush administration to forgo multilateral means in favor of unilateral instruments as evidence of the bid for empire. 106\nIn other words, for such analysts it is the shift from a grand strategy revolving around institutional power to one founded primarily on compulsory power that best signals the new status of the United States as empire.\nThe backdrop to this argument is an interpretation of what accounts for the longevity of American hegemony after World War II and how it differed from previous hegemonies, including the colonial empires it supplanted. The genius of the post\u2013World War II \u201cwise men,\u201d in this way, was to recognize that global rule through coercion was unsustainable, and that it was preferable to establish global institutions that could further American interests and spread American values. 107\nWhat generated consent for American hegemony was not only agreement over the purpose of American power, but also the construction of multilateral institutions that were conferred legitimacy, constrained American power, and democratized the decision-making process. Because these global institutions had some autonomy from the United States and were partly controlled by other states, the United States could not be said to possess them, even though they reflected American interests. What separates American hegemony from American empire in this view, therefore, is the willingness to work jointly with others through multilateral institutions and the consent that is attended to them. 108\nThe Bush administration's decision to shift the weight of American foreign policy from multilateral to unilateral mechanisms provides partial cause for observers to relabel the United States an imperial power.\nBut it is important to recognize how American hegemony, even when run through global institutions, still represented an exercise of institutional power. The absence of overt conflict does not mean the absence of power; institutions can mobilize bias to serve U.S. purposes and eliminate points of potential opposition to serve U.S. concerns. Moreover, global institutions created an asymmetrical distribution of benefits, and the United States has been a prime beneficiary. It is partly for this reason that Bacevich claims that the nature of the American empire since World War II has revolved around global institutions that create \u201copen spaces\u201d that the United States can dominate. 109\nFinally, and most importantly, the United States still exercises power, but now it is indirect and mediated through institutions. Any consideration of the American empire, in short, must be attentive to institutional power. In this respect, perhaps at stake is not whether the United States is or is not an empire, but rather whether the longevity of that empire is dependent on the willingness to eschew unilateral means of control for indirect institutional means\u2014a point that echoes earlier debates over the nature of informal empires. 110\nYet to what extent should the debate about the American empire focus exclusively on the specificity of the United States as an actor? Compulsory and institutional power directs attention to empire as an extension of a centralized, territorial state that maintains control over others, and thus focuses on the policies of the United States in general and the Bush administration in particular. Structural and productive power, however, shift the focus away from particular actors that control, directly or indirectly, others to social relations of constitution. In doing so, it directs attention to the underlying social relations that make possible an assumption of imperial power, give meaning to U.S. foreign policy practices, and imagine empire as having a decentralized, even deterritorialized, form.\nTo consider structural power in debating the existence or implications of U.S. empire means, first and foremost, exploring the structural constitution of the United States as imperial center. This has three interconnected aspects. First, the structure of social relations of material production are transnational and create functional and spatial differentiation between a world-economic core and periphery. Along these lines, scholars influenced by Marxism and world-system theory generally situate their discussions of U.S. foreign policy in the context of how global capitalism generates a particular set of social positions and practices for the United States in direct relationship to the structurally disadvantaged. 111\nSuch a consideration frequently includes a claim that a partially deterritorialized global capitalism constitutes the United States as a capitalist state that is bound up with the authoritative rule of and for global capital. 112\nThis leads to a second observation: because capitalism is global and deterritorialized, so, too, is global rule. 113\nAlthough the United States might play an important role in regulating the world economy, opening up new territories, and ensuring that rogue countries are disciplined, it works with other states and nonstate actors to maintain and expand global capitalism. 114\nThird, the regulation of the world economy is accomplished through a mixture of coercion and consent. The United States has demonstrated a willingness to use its military power to maintain global economic (and associated sociopolitical) stability. It also has worked hard to generate consent\u2014that is, to get those who are structurally disadvantaged because of their position in the world political economy to accept the order of things. Accordingly, entering into the debate on U.S. empire through the lens of structural power leads one to a focus on the structural constitution of the conditions of possibility for the Bush administration's policies in relationship to the material, political, and ideological contradictions of capitalism. 115\nCan the social relations of constitution that generate empire be understood in the more diffuse terms of productive power? A most influential, recent, attempt is Hardt and Negri's definition of \u201cempire,\u201d which has been the subject of much critical attention. Their argument is that transformative discursive and material processes have produced \u201cempire\u201d: a \u201cdecentered and deterritorializing apparatus of rule that progressively incorporates the entire global realm within its open, expanding, frontiers.\u201d 116\nWhat has produced this new form of global rule? Although they join others in identifying the expansion of global capital, they also locate an important role for the development of Western-backed institutions that maintain more consensual and participatory decision-making practices, new discourses such as human rights, equality, and democracy, and counterhegemonic struggles by labor and others that reflect the desire for \u201cliberation\u201d from the \u201cmodern machines of power.\u201d 117\nIbid., 43.\nEmpire, as they conceive it, is not a system in which tribute, power, and resources flow from the outlying regions to a great metropolitan center, but instead consists of more diffuse networks of hierarchy that generate privilege for some and pacify the multitudes.\nHow does this deterritorialized empire constitute the United States? Broadly, social discourses might be viewed as productive of the specific subjectivity of the United States in relationship to imperial subjects. Some circles, for example, exhibit a growing romantic nostalgia for empire. 118\nIt is not uncommon to hear the United States being urged to accept the responsibilities and burdens of empire in helping to bring progress to others. 119\nUSA Today , 6 May 2003, A15.\nThis role is to be performed not only by the United States. A multiplicity of actors and processes are partially responsible for attempting to bring progress, development, human rights, and the rule of law\u2014in short, civilization\u2014to the non-Western world. Along these lines, Judis observed that while there was the formal dismantling of the colonial empires that once played a civilizing mission that stabilized the international order, that role is now shouldered by international organizations. 120\nNew Republic , 9 June 2003, 19\u201323.\nHe proceeded to recommend that the United States continue to use international organizations to perform this civilizing mission, anticipating that they will be better able to bring into being new kinds of actors in world politics. Productive power, in this way, works to produce a particular identity for the United States\u2014a responsible and beneficent imperial actor in relation to others (imperial subjects, themselves irresponsible and in need of such help).\nIn general, any discussion of American empire should be attentive to all forms of power. Certainly there is compulsory power, which is the focus of much of the debate. Yet also present is institutional power and how the United States might indirectly control the behavior of others through global institutions. These first two approaches share, therefore, a concern with how the United States is able to sustain dominance in international affairs in ways that control, directly and indirectly, the foreign policies and even domestic political arrangements of other states. It is possible and desirable, though, to see the American empire as constituted by global social relations. Making this move requires a willingness to see the United States at the imperial center, structurally constituted and discursively produced through a complex of imperial relations that are not themselves fully under the control of the U.S. state as actor. To fully appreciate how power is embedded in empire, though, requires a willingness to see not only the different forms of power, but also how they combine in different ways to create structured and enduring hierarchies of control and advantage.\nPower is a complex and contested concept, in large part because there are important but distinctive ways to understand how social relations shape the fates and choices of actors. If international relations scholars have erred in their past attempts to understand power, it is by trying to identify and rely on a single conception. But no single concept can capture the forms of power in international politics. In order to better enable scholars to see the conceptual variety, we constructed a taxonomy that systematically identifies the different forms of power. We use that taxonomy to encourage scholars not to treat these conceptual forms as competing or vying for recognition as the important operation of power in a particular situation. Instead, we urge scholars to see how the multiple concepts capture the different and interrelated ways in which actors are enabled and constrained in determining their circumstances.\nThe inevitable question, then, is how exactly should we think about the relationship between these forms of power? During the past few years, there have been several important statements regarding how scholars should conceptualize the relationship between different substantive theories of international relations, such as neoliberalism and realism, and different social theories, such as constructivism and rationalism. 121\nJupille, Caporaso, and Checkel suggest several possibilities: incommensurability; competitive testing; sequencing; incorporation (or subsumption); and some type of addition. 122\nWith respect to analysis of power, we reject the first four in favor of the last.\nOne line of argument is that because these different conceptualizations of power derive, in important ways, from different social theoretic commitments, they are incommensurable. Because the theoretic foundations are in tension, the best that can be gotten among concepts of power is some form of conceptual pluralism. We certainly do not believe that a \u201cmaster\u201d theory of power is possible. But there is no social theoretic reason why scholars should not look for areas of connection. We also reject a gladiatorial competition between these conceptions; after all, they capture the different ways in which social relations shape and limit actors' ability to determine their fates. To permanently reject one in favor of another, therefore, would be to risk overlooking a fundamental dimension of power (and therefore return discussions of power to a state of conceptual myopia).\nWe also reject subsumption arguments, on the grounds that they presuppose that there is a foundational element of power that is generative of the other forms. We see ways in which compulsory power shapes productive power, and vice-versa; how institutional power shapes compulsory power, and vice-versa; how institutional power shapes structural power, and vice-versa, and on and on. So, there is no most basic form. On the same grounds, we reject the idea of sequencing because we see no reason to presume that one form of power necessarily and always precedes another. To the contrary, in most social contexts all are operating simultaneously, intersecting with and reflecting off of each other.\nBecause the taxonomy was designed to encourage scholars to see the different forms of power in international politics and the connections between them, we strongly encourage scholars to imagine how different forms interact to sharpen empirical analysis. Different forms of power have different domains of application to the extent that they illuminate different ways in which social relations affect and effect the ability of actors to control their fates. 123\nFor a related argument, see Baldwin 2002 , 178.\nBut, as we illustratively suggested in the discussions of global governance and American empire, these different conceptualizations are not only distinct, but also intertwined.\nAlthough Carr is routinely considered to be the individual most responsible for establishing the focal conceptualization of power and associating that conceptualization with realism, in our view his work in fact suggests what we are advocating. 124\nAs expected from someone deeply influenced by Mannheim and Marx, his Twenty Years' Crisis and his analysis of international order exhibit a far-reaching understanding of what power does and how power works. He certainly articulated various elements of compulsory power. His explicit discussion of power was largely limited to its multiple instruments (for him military force, economic wealth, and public opinion or propaganda) that could be used to overcome resistance from another \u201cpolitical society.\u201d Yet he also attended to features of institutional power as he saw how power works through international institutions, including international law, which, in turn, shape the policies of states and help to legitimate and sustain international orders. In Carr's view, international organizations, such as the League of Nations and emergent principles of international law, institutionalize the interests of the powerful and work against those of the weak. His critique of the League of Nations, therefore, included more than the standard (but false) criticism that its architects and advocates believed that somehow it would magically erase the causes of war; it also included the claim that these international institutions that embodied so-called universal principles, in fact, maintain the international status quo at the expense of some in the service of others. The hubris of idealists, Carr argued, is to believe that somehow these international institutions are antidotes to power and represent a positive-sum game. Indeed, for Carr, it was the very fact that they mask relations of power that transforms them into stealth weapons of domination.\nAs a student of Marx, Carr also saw power as structural\u2014as including social processes that define state interests themselves. Drawing inspiration from Marxian theories of false consciousness, for example, he claimed that ideologies such as free trade are part of power politics precisely because they can lead indoctrinated states to consent to new forms of economic relations that insert them into new relations of dependence and exploitation. International orders are easier to sustain for the powerful if the dominated submit to their own domination, Carr acknowledged clearly and explicitly. Finally, as someone who was influenced by Mannheim, he was keenly aware of how broad discourses such as \u201cprogress,\u201d carried by intellectuals and established institutions, constitute what are acceptable practices and goals (always trying but never quite eradicating power) and shape broader categories of \u201ccivilized\u201d and \u201cuncivilized\u201d states. Carr reminds us that power exists at the surface, and also well below; he shows that to understand power means to understand its various forms. As scholars of international relations continue to debate the nature, role, and explanatory significance of power, they should recognize the workings of multiple concepts and systematically employ them in their research. After all, that is the way Carr would have wanted it.\nAbbott , Kenneth , and Duncan Snidal . 1998 . Why States Act Through Formal International Organizations .

Yet disciplinary discussions tend to privilege only one, albeit important, form: an actor controlling another to do what that other would not otherwise do. By showing conceptual favoritism, the discipline not only overlooks the different forms of power in international politics, but also fails to develop sophisticated understandings of how global outcomes are produced and how actors are differentially enabled and constrained to determine their fates. We argue that scholars of international relations should employ multiple conceptions of power and develop a conceptual framework that encourages rigorous attention to power in its different forms. We first begin by producing a taxonomy of power. Power is the production, in and through social relations, of effects that shape the capacities of actors to determine their circumstances and fate. This general concept entails two crucial, analytical dimensions: the kinds of social relations through which power works (in relations of interaction or in social relations of constitution); and the specificity of social relations through which effects are produced (specific/direct or diffuse/indirect). These distinctions generate our taxonomy and four concepts of power: compulsory, institutional, structural, and productive. We then illustrate how attention to the multiple forms of power matters for the analysis of global governance and American empire. We conclude by urging scholars to beware of the idea that the multiple concepts are competing, and instead to see connections between them in order to generate more robust understandings of how power works in international politics.  \u00a9 2005 The IO Foundation and Cambridge University Press The potentially system-defining attacks of September 11, the war on terrorism, and the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq have caused scholars and practitioners to refocus attention on a central concept in international politics: power. If the past is a good predictor of the future, however, debate is likely to be limited conceptually, informed primarily by a realist conception of power\u2014the ability of states to use material resources to get others to do what they otherwise would not. Indeed, this is already happening. Much of the conversation triggered by the U.S. invasion of Iraq, for instance, has focused on unipolarity, the ability of the United States to use its military and economic resources to overcome resistance by states and nonstate actors, and whether other states will balance against or bandwagon with U.S. power. Certainly, any consideration of power in international politics must include such questions. But, Mae West's views notwithstanding, too much of a good thing is not always wonderful. Instead, it can produce theoretical tunnel vision that causes scholars to overlook others forms and effects of power. In this essay we argue that scholars of international relations must work with multiple conceptions of power, suggest how they can accomplish this task, and demonstrate how a consideration of power's polymorphous character will enhance and deepen theoretic understanding of international politics. Ever since Carr delivered his devastating rhetorical blow against the \u201cutopians\u201d and claimed power for \u201crealism,\u201d the discipline of international relations has tended to treat power as the exclusive province of realism. 1 Accordingly, a concern with power in international politics is frequently interpreted as a disciplinary attachment to realism. Associated with this tendency, there is a widely accepted conceptualization that is viewed as the only way to understand power: how one state uses its material resources to compel another state to do something it does not want to do. Most introductory texts to international relations cleave to this formulation. Attempts by scholars to operationalize power follow from this definition. 2 The substantial literature on the \u201cparadoxes of power\u201d revolves around the disconnect between capabilities and outcomes. 3 The disciplinary tendency to associate power with realism and to work primarily with the realist conceptualization partly owes to the fact that rivals to realism typically distance themselves from \u201cpower\u201d considerations. 4 We recognize this narrative of the discipline necessarily overlooks other contributions that never pivoted around realism. Later in the article we introduce some of these alternative perspectives. This feature has been especially visible in recent years, as neoliberal institutionalists, liberals, and constructivists have attempted to demonstrate their theoretical salience by demonstrating how \u201cpower\u201d variables are not causally consequential in their explanation of empirical outcomes. Neoliberals have argued how states with convergent interests create international institutions and arrangements that effectively tame (state) power, highlighting processes of social choice and leaving the impression that institutions are the antidote to power. 5 Scholars of liberal international relations theory typically stress that many important international outcomes cannot be adequately explained with reference to power, but instead are better understood by the salutary presence of democracy, particular configurations of domestic interests, liberal values, economic interdependence, or international institutions. 6 Mainstream constructivists, too, have pitted themselves against explanations in terms of power as they have attempted to demonstrate the causal significance of normative structures and processes of learning and persuasion. 7 Because these rivals to realism have juxtaposed their arguments to realism's emphasis on power, they have neglected to develop how power is conceptualized and operates within their theories. It could have been otherwise. These theoretical approaches draw from distinct social theoretic traditions that offer critical insights into the forms and effects of power. Although neoliberal institutionalists have tended to highlight how international institutions produce cooperation, they could just as easily have emphasized how institutions shape the bargaining advantage of actors, freeze asymmetries, and establish parameters for change that benefit some at the expense of others. Although liberals have tended to limit their claims to the liberalism of \u201cprogress,\u201d they could have developed the liberalism of \u201cfear\u201d that is more centrally concerned with power. 8 Although constructivists have emphasized how underlying normative structures constitute actors' identities and interests, they have rarely treated these normative structures themselves as defined and infused by power, or emphasized how constitutive effects also are expressions of power. A consequence of this failure to develop alternative conceptualizations of power has been to reinforce the discipline's gravitation toward the default conception as defined by realism. Yet, as famously noted by Gallie, and as repeated by social theorists ever since, power is an essentially contested concept. 9 Its status owes not only to the desire by scholars to agree to disagree, but also to their awareness that power works in various forms and has various expressions that cannot be captured by a single formulation. The failure to develop alternative conceptualizations of power limits the ability of international relations scholars to understand how global outcomes are produced and how actors are differentially enabled and constrained to determine their fates. One certainly needs to know about the ability of actors to use resources to control the behavior of others. The United States is able to use its military power to compel others to change their foreign policies, and in the contemporary period transnational activists have been able to shame multinational corporations and abusive governments to alter their economic and human rights policies, respectively. Any discussion of power in international politics, then, must include a consideration of how, why, and when some actors have \u201cpower over\u201d others. Yet one also needs to consider the enduring structures and processes of global life that enable and constrain the ability of actors to shape their fates and their futures. The extension of sovereignty from the West to the developing world gave decolonized states the authority to voice their interests and represent themselves, and the emergence of a human rights discourse helped to make possible the very category of human rights activists who give voice to human rights norms. Analysis of power in international relations, then, must include a consideration of how social structures and processes generate differential social capacities for actors to define and pursue their interests and ideals. 10 The starting point for opening the conceptual aperture is to identify the critical dimensions that generate different conceptualizations of power. In general terms, power is the production, in and through social relations, of effects that shape the capacities of actors to determine their circumstances and fate. 11 This definition slightly amends Scott 2001 , 1\u20132, by pointing explicitly to the operation of power through social relations. The general concept of power that we employ is restricted to the production of particular kinds of effects, namely those on the capacities of actors to determine the conditions of their existence. There is an alternative tradition that sees power as the production of any and all effects and thus as nearly synonymous with causality. 12 What does this alternative tradition keep in that we leave out? It includes social relations of joint action through mutual agreement and interactions in which one actor is able to convince another actor to alter voluntarily and freely its beliefs, interests, or action. Persuasion, then, is social causation but falls outside of our concept of power. So, too, do processes of collective choice that produce joint action. We believe that our circumscribed conception is preferable for two reasons. It better reflects conventional understandings insofar as most scholars interested in power are concerned not simply with how effects are produced, but rather with how these effects work to the advantage of some and the disadvantage of others. We also believe that a focus on differential effects on actor capacities is, empirically, closer to the mark in most social relations. There are moments of completely voluntary persuasion and collective choice, but they are certainly rare and, on close inspection, likely to have uneven effects. This definition informs our argument that conceptual distinctions of power should be represented in terms of two analytical dimensions that are at the core of the general concept: the kinds of social relations through which power works; and the specificity of social relations through which effects on actors' capacities are produced. The first dimension\u2014kinds\u2014refers to the polar positions of social relations of interaction and social relations of constitution. Accordingly, power is either an attribute of particular actors and their interactions or a social process of constituting what actors are as social beings, that is, their social identities and capacities. It can operate, for example, by pointing a gun and issuing commands, or in underlying social structures and systems of knowledge that advantage some and disadvantage others. The second dimension\u2014specificity\u2014concerns the degree to which the social relations through which power works are direct and socially specific or indirect and socially diffuse. It can operate, for example, at the very instant when the gun is brandished, or through diffuse processes embedded in international institutions that establish rules determining who gets to participate in debates and make decisions. These two dimensions generate our taxonomy of four types of power. 13 Our taxonomy bears some resemblance to, but is distinct from, the conventional \u201cfour faces\u201d approach to power because, we contend, ours is analytically more systematic and precise, and conceptually more general. Digeser nicely summarizes the differences among the four faces in the following way: \u201cUnder the first face of power the central question is, \u2018Who, if anyone, is exercising power?\u2019 Under the second face, \u2018What issues have been mobilized off the agenda and by whom?\u2019 Under the radical conception, \u2018Whose objective interests are being harmed?\u2019 Under the fourth face of power the critical issue is, \u2018What kind of subject is being produced?\u2019\u201d Digeser 1992 , 980. For other summaries of these faces, see Hayward 2000 , chap. 1; and Hay 1997 . Because the four faces developed sequentially through a progressive debate about gaps and absences in prior conceptions, they are not elements in a systematic typology. There are no analytical dimensions that distinguish across all four faces, and the faces overlap and blur into one another. Effective taxonomic exercises must try to \u201ccarve nature at its joints\u201d to derive critical, mutually exclusive, and exhaustive distinctions. 14 Toward this end, in the first section below we present our attempt to carve power at its joints. The first type is power as relations of interaction of direct control by one actor over another\u2014Compulsory Power; the second is the control actors exercise indirectly over others through diffuse relations of interaction\u2014Institutional Power; the third is the constitution of subjects' capacities in direct structural relation to one another\u2014Structural Power; and the fourth is the socially diffuse production of subjectivity in systems of meaning and signification\u2014Productive Power. These different conceptualizations provide distinct answers to the fundamental question: in what respects are actors able to determine their fate, and how is that ability limited or enhanced through social relations with others? Our taxonomy of power offers several advantages for scholars of international relations theory. First, because it is founded on an explicit and logically systematic decomposition of the general concept of power, it is able to detach discussions of power from the limitations of realism and to encourage scholars to see power's multiple forms. Realism's prominence has contributed to a situation in which scholars are often asked to choose a realist formulation to the neglect of an alternative, or vice versa. 15 Those who want to expand the conceptualization of power frequently pose theirs as a supplement or an alternative to the realist benchmark. Nye, for example, offers his concept of \u201csoft power\u201d as a counterpoint to the realist emphasis on \u201chard power.\u201d 16 Gruber's concept of \u201cgo-it-alone power\u201d is a modification of realist-influenced approaches. 17 Although these statements usefully expand the scope of the concept, their posing as an alternative to a realist formulation presumes that scholars must choose sides. Because our taxonomy alerts scholars to the fact that multiple forms of power are simultaneously present in international politics, it discourages a presumptive dismissal of other conceptual forms. Second, our approach provides a framework for integration. Taxonomies not only highlight distinct types but also point to connections between them. In other words, the different types should not be seen as necessarily competing concepts, but rather as different forms in which power works in international politics. Our framework, therefore, suggests how scholars might consider how productive power makes some instances of compulsory power possible and legitimate, and, in turn, how compulsory power shapes the terms of meaning that influence how actors see what is possible and desirable. Third, our approach represents a decisive advantage over recent contributions to the debate about power in international relations because it incorporates both social relations of interaction and constitution, that is, both \u201cpower over\u201d and \u201cpower to.\u201d Baldwin's influential contributions have relied heavily on a Dahlian formulation\u2014in which A exercises influence over B\u2014and then attempt to incorporate a variety of concerns, including unintended effects and nonmaterial means of influence. 18 Although we agree with him on many points, a fundamental problem is that his actor-oriented approach is incapable of recognizing social relations of constitution and how power inheres in structures and discourses that are not possessed or controlled by any single actor. In a series of important articles, Guzzini has urged international relations scholars to expand their understanding of power. 19 See Guzzini 1993 , 2000 , and 2002 . Although our approaches overlap, they nevertheless differ in two important respects. First, he insists that power be reserved for moments when an actor intentionally produces effects, and that constitutive arguments be understood as \u201cgovernance.\u201d 20 We believe that by limiting power to those effects that are intentionally produced, he unnecessarily overlooks the important ways in which effects on the capacities and courses of action available to actors are unintentionally produced through social relations. Also, by treating power as an \u201cagent concept\u201d and creating a new concept, \u201cgovernance,\u201d for those \u201ceffects not due to a particular agent,\u201d he establishes a false dichotomy. 21 Ibid., 443. Governance necessarily entails power; the two are not in conceptual opposition. Our taxonomy, therefore, provides a systematic way of thinking about power in terms of both agency and structure, and thus allows us to incorporate the two elements of his argument in a single integrated conceptual framework. Last, but hardly least, our taxonomy does not map precisely onto different theories of international relations. To be sure, each theoretical tradition does favor an understanding of power that corresponds to one or another of the concepts distinguished by our taxonomy. For instance, as noted above, realists work with versions that correspond to compulsory power, and critical theorists typically work with versions that correspond to structural or productive power. But, as we show, it need not be this way. Scholars can and should draw from various conceptualizations of power that are associated with other theoretical schools. We believe that such poaching and cross-fertilization is healthy, needed, and might, in a small way, help scholars move away from perpetual rivalry in disciplinary \u201cism\u201d wars and toward dialogue across theoretical perspectives. In the second section we briefly illustrate why attention to the multiple forms of power affects empirical research through reference to two domains of contemporary theoretical significance\u2014global governance and the debate over American empire. As scholars continue to consider power in international politics, they would do well not to fixate on a single rendition but instead to appreciate how the range of conceptualizations provides the basis for a better, richer, and fuller understanding of the workings of world politics. We conclude on this theme, briefly discussing how such cross-fertilization builds bridges between these concepts, and how scholars might think about the possible relationships. Power is the production, in and through social relations, of effects on actors that shape their capacity to control their fate. This concept has two dimensions at its core: (1) the kinds of social relations through which actors' capacities are affected (and effected); and, (2) the specificity of those social relations. Conventionally for social theorists, social relations can be viewed as being broadly of two kinds: relations of interaction among previously constituted social actors; or relations of constitution of actors as particular kinds of social beings. For the second dimension, the crucial distinction is whether the social relations of interaction or constitution through which power works are direct and specific, or indirect and socially diffuse. Below we explore each dimension, then show how the polar positions within each dimension combine to generate our taxonomy of power. The first dimension concerns whether power works in interactions or social constitution. One position on this dimension treats social relations as comprised of the actions of preconstituted social actors toward one another. Here, power works through behavioral relations or interactions, which, in turn, affect the ability of others to control the circumstances of their existence. In these conceptions, power nearly becomes an attribute that an actor possesses and may use knowingly as a resource to shape the actions or conditions of action of others. The other position consists of social relations of constitution. Here, power works through social relations that analytically precede the social or subject positions of actors and that constitute them as social beings with their respective capacities and interests. Constitutive relations cannot be reduced to the attributes, actions, or interactions of pregiven actors. Power, accordingly, is irreducibly social. In other words, constitutive arguments examine how particular social relations are responsible for producing particular kinds of actors. As Wendt puts it, \u201cConstitutive theories \u2026 account for the properties of things by reference to the structures in virtue of which they exist.\u201d 22 Because these social relations, in effect, generate different social kinds that have different self- (and other-) understandings and capacities, they have real consequences for an actor's ability to shape the conditions and processes of its existence. This conceptual distinction between power working through social relations of interaction or in social relations of constitution tracks fairly closely with a distinction that frequents the literature on power: \u201cpower over\u201d and \u201cpower to.\u201d Concepts of power rooted in behavior and interaction point to actors' exercise of control over others; they are, then, \u201cpower over\u201d concepts. Concepts of power tied to social relations of constitution, in contrast, consider how social relations define who the actors are and what capacities and practices they are socially empowered to undertake; these concepts are, then, focused on the social production of actors' \u201cpower to.\u201d Some scholars, who examine how constitutive relations make possible certain types of action, focus on how community or collective action are facilitated, while others stress how the social relations of constitution can have a disciplining effect and therefore lead to self-regulation and internalized constraints. 23 In either case, though, the concern is with the effect of social relations of constitution on human capacity. This interaction/constitutive distinction also foregrounds particular features of the effects of power. Because power is a property of actors' actions and interactions in behavioral conceptions, there is a strong tendency to see its effects primarily in terms of the behavior of the object of power. In contrast, constitutive power is generally seen as producing effects only in terms of the identities of the occupants of social positions. We want to stress, though, that there is no ontological or epistemological reason why scholars working with one of those concepts need exclude the effects identified by the other. If power works through the actions of specific actors in shaping the ways and the extent to which other actors exercise control over their fate, it can have a variety of effects, ranging from directly affecting the behavior of others to setting the terms of their very self-understandings; behavioral power, then, can have effects on actors' subjectivities and self-understandings. Similarly, if power is in social relations of constitution, it works in fixing what actors are as social beings, which, in turn, defines the meaningful practices in which they are disposed to engage as subjects; constitutive power, then, has effects on behavioral tendencies. Thus scholars examining power through social interaction can see effects on social identities, and those examining power through constitutive relations can see effects on action. The second core analytical dimension concerns how specific\u2014direct and immediate\u2014are the social relations through which power works. Specific relations of power entail some immediate and generally tangible causal or constitutive connection between the subject and the object, or between two subjects. Scholars working with this conception tend to presume that connections between actors are mechanistic, flush with contact, direct, or logically necessary. A consequence of this dependence on social proximity is that it becomes more difficult to observe power in operation the greater is the social distance, the lag between stimulus and effect, or the absence of logical necessity, characterizing these connections. This approach is nicely summarized by Dahl's famous claim that there is \u201cno action at a distance.\u201d 24 Although Dahl intentionally left vague both what counts as \u201cdistance\u201d and the meaning of \u201cconnection\u201d between two actors, he stressed that a relation of power is knowable if and only if there is an observable and traceable connection between A and B. Consequently, while his conceptualization did not preclude the idea of power as spatially, temporally, or socially indirect or diffuse, it did work against it. But it is not only Dahl's and related behavioral conceptions that operate with a specific and direct view of power. Some constitutive analyses do so as well. For example, scholars such as Bhaskar, Giddens, and Wendt point to the structured relationship of co-constitution between social roles or structural positions (such as Marxian class categories), and how their social capacities are defined in direct and specific relation to other roles or positions. 25 In this way, they identify a direct and specific relationship between the social positions, which are jointly constituted structurally. 26 Also see Isaac 1987 . This is how Marxist approaches consider, for instance, the co-constitutive social relations of capital and labor in capitalism; the capitalist class structure generates distinctive social capacities and interests of the social positions of capital and labor. In general, specific relations concern the direct causal/constitutive connection between actors that are in physical, historical, or social positional proximity. Other approaches see power in indirect and socially diffuse relations. Instead of insisting that power work through an immediate, direct, and specific relationship, these conceptions allow for the possibility of power even if the connections are detached and mediated, or operate at a physical, temporal, or social distance. Scholars that locate power in the rules of institutions, whether formal or informal, frequently trace its operation to such indirect mechanisms. Those examining concrete institutions have shown how evolving rules and decision-making procedures can shape outcomes in ways that favor some groups over others; these effects can operate over time and at a distance, and often in ways that were not intended or anticipated by the architects of the institution. 27 Similarly, scholars influenced by poststructuralism examine how historically and contingently produced discourses shape the subjectivities of actors; the very reason for genealogical and discourse-analytic methods is to demonstrate how systems of knowledge and discursive practices produce subjects through social relations that are quite indirect, socially diffuse, and temporally distant. 28 For instance, students of gender, race, and nation routinely recognize how socially diffuse discourses, and not isolated, direct, and proximate actions, produce the subjects of the modern world. 29 These two core dimensions\u2014the kinds of social relations through which power works, and the specificity of the social relations through which power's effects are produced\u2014generate a fourfold taxonomy of power as illustrated in Figure 1 . Each cell in Figure 1 represents a different conceptual type. Compulsory power exists in the direct control of one actor over the conditions of existence and/or the actions of another. Institutional power exists in actors' indirect control over the conditions of action of socially distant others. Structural power operates as the constitutive relations of a direct and specific\u2014hence, mutually constituting\u2014kind. Productive power works through diffuse constitutive relations to produce the situated social capacities of actors. Taxonomy of power Because concepts of power are partly distinguished by the conceptualized relationship between agency and structure, our taxonomy relates to the agent-structure duality to the extent that the generic concern is with the relationship between social context and human action. We want to stress, though, that because each type of power has at least an implicit view of both agency and structure, none simply reflects an entirely agentic or structural perspective (to the neglect of the other). Nevertheless, they do vary in specific ways. Compulsory (and, to a lesser degree, institutional) power emphasizes agency to the point where structure becomes the context in which A's actions and B's reactions are set and constrained, thereby leaning heavily on agency and treating structure as constraint. In contrast, concepts of structural and productive power emphasize structure relative to purposeful agency, even while recognizing that meaningful practices, and hence, human agency, are essential in producing, reproducing and possibly transforming these structures. This first concept of power focuses on a range of relations between actors that allow one to shape directly the circumstances or actions of another. Some of the most famous and widely used definitions of power fall under this concept. Weber defined power as the \u201cprobability that one actor within a social relationship will be in a position to carry out his own will despite resistance, regardless of the basis on which this probability exists.\u201d 30 Similarly, Blau defined it as the influence over behavior through negative sanctions. 31 In terms of sheer influence, especially for scholars of international relations, arguably no definition surpasses that of Dahl's earliest formulation. 32 Dahl 1957 , 202\u20133. As Baldwin 2002 , 177, claimed, \u201cnone rivals this one in widespread acceptability.\u201d Dahl modified his views in later statements. See Dahl and Stinebrickner 2003 . For him, power is best understood as the ability of A to get B to do what B otherwise would not do. Dahl's concept has three defining features. One, there is intentionality on the part of Actor A. What counts is that A wants B to alter its actions in a particular direction. If B alters its actions under the mistaken impression that A wants it to, then that would not count as power because it was not A's intent that B do so. Two, there must be a conflict of desires, to the extent that B now feels compelled to alter its behavior. A and B want different outcomes, and B loses. Three, A is successful because it has material and ideational resources at its disposal that lead B to alter its actions. Although theorists have debated whether the relevant resources are an intrinsic property of actors or are better understood as part of a relationship of dependence between two or more actors, the underlying claim is that identifiable resources that are controlled and intentionally deployed by actors are what counts for thinking about power. 33 For the first claim, see Emerson 1962 ; Blau 1964 ; and Wrong 1988 . For the second, see Laswell and Kaplan 1980 ; and Russell 1986 , 19\u201320. Although Dahl's initial conceptualization usefully illustrates the concept of compulsory power, our taxonomy highlights how compulsory power need not hinge on intentionality. 34 On this point we agree with Baldwin 2002 , and disagree with Guzzini 1993 . Compulsory power is present whenever A's actions control B's actions or circumstances, even if unintentionally. As Bachrach and Baratz argue, power still exists even when those who dominate are not conscious of how their actions are producing unintended effects. 35 The victims of \u201ccollateral damage\u201d of bombing campaigns certainly experience the power of the deliverer even if it was not the latter's intention to create such damage. Because power is the production of effects, arguably compulsory power is best understood from the perspective of the recipient, not the deliverer, of the direct action. Compulsory power has significantly influenced thinking about power in international politics. 36 See Claude 1962 ; Knorr 1973 ; and Baldwin 1989 and 2002 . For a discussion and critique of power-centered analysis, see Vasquez 1998 ; and Guzzini 1993 and 1998 . Specifically, its emphasis on control by identifiable actors over the objections of other actors through deployment (even if only symbolically) of resources informs much of realist thought. For many scholars\u2014both realists and their critics\u2014to study power in international relations is to consider how one state is able to use material resources to advance its interests in direct opposition to the interests of another state. This approach steers attention to the great powers. Yet major powers are not alone in the ability to deploy resources to overcome the objections of actors. Multinational corporations can use their control over capital to shape the foreign economic policies of developing states, as well as global economic policies. Nonstate networks and groups sometimes conduct campaigns of unconventional warfare that terrorize entire populations. Compulsory power is not limited to material resources; it also entails symbolic and normative resources. 37 Nongovernmental organizations have deployed normative resources to compel targeted states to alter their policies through a strategy of shaming. 38 Drawing from the work of Goffman and Bourdieu, Barnett argued that Arab states have used symbolic sanctions to alter the behavior of other Arab states on a range of issues. 39 Less powerful members of the Security Council are able to use legal norms to constrain the actions of the powerful. 40 International organizations are able to use their expert, moral, delegated, and rational-legal authority as a resource to compel state and nonstate actors to change their behavior. 41 In general, scholars should be attentive to a range of technologies and mechanisms as they consider how one actor is able to directly control the conditions of behavior of another actor. In fact, there is a long pedigree for doing just that. Carr began this tradition when he distinguished between military, economic, and propaganda power, corresponding respectively to the threatened or actual deployment of violence, nonviolent sanctions, and normative pressure. 42 These distinctions do usefully refine one's understanding of how compulsory power works, but from the perspective of our taxonomy these are refinements of a specific concept of power, compulsory power, and not distinct concepts, per se. Whereas compulsory power entails the direct control of one actor of the conditions and actions of another, institutional power is actors' control of others in indirect ways. Specifically, the conceptual focus here is on the formal and informal institutions that mediate between A and B, as A, working through the rules and procedures that define those institutions, guides, steers, and constrains the actions (or nonactions) and conditions of existence of others. 43 We caution against two possible, but inapt, connotations of institutional power: the power of institutions as actors in their own right (for example, the World Bank's power over borrowing countries); and the effect of institutions in constituting social subjects (for example, the institution of sovereignty affects the constitution of state subjects). The former is best understood as compulsory power and the latter as either structural or productive power. Institutional power, in other words, does not include any and all aspects of power by, in, and through institutions. Instead, it is preconstituted actors exercising control over others indirectly through institutions. Thus compulsory and institutional power differ in the following ways. To begin, whereas compulsory power typically rests on the resources that are deployed by A to exercise power directly over B, A cannot necessarily be said to \u201cpossess\u201d the institution that constrains and shapes B. It is certainly possible that a dominant actor maintains total control over an institution, which, in turn, lords over other actors. If so, then it is arguably best to conceptualize the institution as possessed by the actor, that is, as an instrument of compulsory power. But rare is the institution that is completely dominated by one actor. Instead, it is much more likely that an institution has some independence from specific resource-laden actors. 44 This provides the principal analytical grounds for making the move to the institutional context. Second, the recognition of the importance of institutional arrangements highlights that A and B are socially removed from\u2014only indirectly related to\u2014one another. This distance can be spatial or temporal. Spatially, A's actions affect the behavior or conditions of others only through institutional arrangements (such as decisional rules, formalized lines of responsibility, divisions of labor, and structures of dispersed dependence); power is no longer a matter of A's direct effect on B, but works instead through socially extended, institutionally diffuse relations. In other words, A does not \u201cpossess\u201d the resources of power, but because A stands in a particular relation to the relevant institutional arrangements, its actions exercise power over B. Temporally, institutions established at one point in time can have ongoing and unintended effects at a later point. Long-standing institutions represent frozen configurations of privilege and bias that can continue to shape the future choices of actors. Third, analyses of institutional power necessarily consider the decisions that were not made (the proverbial dogs that do not bark) because of institutional arrangements that limit some opportunities and bias directions, particularly of collective action. 45 Bachrach and Baratz 1962 and 1963 . Compulsory power, too, can entail \u201cnondecision.\u201d For example, failing even to consider the possibility of distributing certain medications to populations in dire need of them can be a form of direct control of A over B. Institutional arrangements can shape the agenda-setting process in ways that eliminate those very issues that are points of conflict. International relations scholars have developed a range of arguments that examine how formal and informal institutions enable some actors to shape the behavior or circumstances of socially distant others. The literature on formal and informal agenda setting focuses on who sets the agenda and how that agenda omits certain possibilities. 46 Also of relevance is the literature that highlights traditional notions of dependence; that is, how material processes limit the choices available to dependent actors. Hirschman, for example, famously argued that market forces can create dependent relationships that limit the weaker actor's choices. 47 Hirschman 1945 . Aspects of Hirschman's argument, of course, emphasize direct relations of dependence between two countries, and hence, compulsory power. Along similar lines, Keohane and Nye considered how enduring systems of exchange and interdependence can be media of power. 48 Also prominent here are neoliberal institutional approaches that focus on the behavioral constraints and governing biases of institutions. The general concern is with durable solutions to games of interdependent choice and how institutions help to solve coordination and cooperation dilemmas. Yet the institutional rules that establish a particular focal point also serve to generate unequal leverage in determining collective outcomes. In short, the institutions that are established to help actors achieve mutually acceptable, even Pareto-superior, outcomes also create \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers,\u201d to the extent that the ability to use the institution and, accordingly, collective rewards\u2014material and normative\u2014are unevenly distributed long into the future and beyond the intentions of the creators. 49 Indeed, many scholars examining how international institutions look from the vantage point of the weak tend to stress those very features. 50 See Murphy 1984 ; and Ayoob 1995 , chap. 7. Structural power concerns the structures\u2014or, more precisely, the co-constitutive, internal relations of structural positions\u2014that define what kinds of social beings actors are. It produces the very social capacities of structural, or subject, positions in direct relation to one another, and the associated interests, that underlie and dispose action. This makes this type of power quite different from institutional power. Whereas institutional power focuses on differential constraints on action, structural power concerns the determination of social capacities and interests. This important difference owes chiefly to their different theoretic understandings of structure. Scholars focusing on institutional power usually define institutions and structure in almost interchangeable terms, as sets of rules, procedures, and norms that constrain the action of already-constituted actors with fixed preferences. Scholars focusing on structural power conceive structure as an internal relation\u2014that is, a direct constitutive relation such that the structural position, A, exists only by virtue of its relation to structural position, B. 51 The classic examples here are master-slave and capital-labor relations. From this perspective, the kinds of social beings that are mutually constituted are directly or internally related; that is, the social relational capacities, subjectivities, and interests of actors are directly shaped by the social positions that they occupy. Structural power shapes the fates and conditions of existence of actors in two critical ways. One, structural positions do not necessarily generate equal social privileges; instead structures allocate differential capacities, and typically differential advantages, to different positions. Capital-labor and master-slave relations are obvious examples of how social structures constitute unequal social privileges and capacities. Two, the social structure not only constitutes actors and their capacities, it also shapes their self-understanding and subjective interests. The consequence is that structures that distribute asymmetric privileges also affect the interests of actors, often leaving them willing to \u201caccept their role in the existing order of things.\u201d 52 In other words, structural power can work to constrain some actors from recognizing their own domination. To the degree that it does, actors' self-understandings and dispositions for action serve to reproduce, rather than to resist, the differential capacities and privileges of structure. As Steven Lukes observed: \u201cis it not the supreme and most insidious exercise of power to prevent people, to whatever degree, from having grievances shaping their perceptions, cognitions, and preferences in such a way that they accept their role in the existing order of things?\u201d 53 Ibid. It is possible to construct a compulsory power answer to this question. For instance, A might act to alter the beliefs of B, thereby making it easier to control B, as it is always easier to maintain a social order through consent than through coercion. Baldwin 2002 , 179, gives the example of brainwashing. Related is Hurrell and Woods's 1995 concept of coercive socialization and Ikenberry and Kupchan's 1990 notion of hegemonic power. In this way, structural power operates even when there are no instances of A acting to exercise control over B. 54 This approach relates to the distinction between objective and subjective interests. See Benton 1981 . Various international relations scholars forward arguments that have strong shades of structural power. Most obviously, Marxist-influenced scholars gravitate toward this concept. 55 Marxists are not alone in emphasizing structural power. Bourdieu 2001 focuses on the global importance of masculine domination produced through the structure of patriarchy. Strange 1989 developed a non-Marxian approach to what she calls structural power. Explicitly following Lukes and Gramsci, Gill and Law argue that while power exists in coercion and institutional arrangements, to understand the workings of the global capitalist economy requires recognition of global production relations as constitutive structure. 56 For them, as well as other Gramscians and historical materialists, the structure of global capitalism substantially determines the capacities and resources of actors. 57 It also shapes their ideology\u2014that is, the interpretive system through which they understand their interests and desires. This ideology, according to scholars like Gill and Law, is hegemonic in that it serves the objective interests of the capitalists and their fellow travelers at the direct expense of the objective (but not, then, recognized) interests of the world's producing classes, thereby disposing action toward the reproduction, rather than the substantial transformation, of the structure and its relations of domination. In the same spirit, Cox draws on Machiavelli's notion of power as a centaur: it operates overtly to the extent that one actor will manipulate strategic constraints for the purposes of controlling the actions of actors (the beast of compulsory and institutional power), and it operates covertly to the extent that it generates the social powers, values, and interpretations of reality that deeply structure internal control (the man that is structural power). 58 World-systems theorists also draw on this conception of power to the extent that they argue that: structures of production generate particular kinds of states identified as core, semiperiphery, and periphery; the positions in the world-system generate commensurate sets of identities and interests; and those in the subordinate positions adopt (ideologically generated) conceptions of interest that support their own domination and their lesser position in that world-system. 59 Because many constructivists draw from structurally oriented theories of sociology, they also are sometimes attentive to structural power. Wendt, for instance, argues that \u201ca key aspect of any cultural form is its role structure, the configuration of subject positions that shared ideas make available to its holders.\u201d 60 He proceeds to note that the role structures can contain functional differentiation and thus generate differential privileges and capacities to the occupants of these roles. 61 Although constructivists who draw from sociological institutionalism do not usually adopt a notion of structure as a set of internal relations, they make a related conceptual move, suggesting a hint of structural power, to the extent that rules, which often are associated with and can generate roles, produce the identities and interests of actors. 62 This tendency is especially evident among those associated with the world polity school. Boli and Thomas, for instance, argue that there is a world authority structure, a set of fundamental principles, that constitutes who are the actors of world politics, what are their identities, what are their expressive purposes, and what are their differential capacities. Consequently, they argue that the institutionalization of a world authority structure that is organized around rational-legal values increasingly privileges the voices of international nongovernmental organizations. 63 Productive power and structural power overlap in several important respects. Both are attentive to constitutive social processes that are, themselves, not controlled by specific actors, but that are effected only through the meaningful practices of actors. Both concern how the social capacities of actors are socially produced, and how these processes shape actors' self-understandings and perceived interests. Additionally, neither concept of power depends on the existence of expressed conflict (although resistance is at the heart of the dynamics of change of them). Yet structural and productive power differ in a critical respect: whereas the former works through direct structural relations, the latter entails more generalized and diffuse social processes. Specifically, and at the risk of gross simplification, structural power is structural constitution, that is, the production and reproduction of internally related positions of super- and subordination, or domination, that actors occupy. Productive power, by contrast, is the constitution of all social subjects with various social powers through systems of knowledge and discursive practices of broad and general social scope. Conceptually, the move is away from structures, per se, to systems of signification and meaning (which are structured, but not themselves structures), and to networks of social forces perpetually shaping one another. In that respect, attention to productive power looks beyond (or is post-) structures. This difference between direct and diffuse social relations of constitution has two important implications for thinking about productive power. First, productive power concerns discourse, the social processes and the systems of knowledge through which meaning is produced, fixed, lived, experienced, and transformed. 64 Discourses are understood here not as dialogues among specific actors or in terms of Habermasian notions of communicative action. Instead, the concept refers to how \u201cmicrofields\u201d or the quotidian \u201cdefine the (im)possible, the (im)probable, the natural, the normal, what counts as a problem.\u201d 65 In this way, discourses are sites of social relations of power because they situate ordinary practices of life and define the social fields of action that are imaginable and possible. 66 Second, discursive processes and practices produce social identities and capacities as they give meaning to them. In Foucault's archetypical formulation, humans are not only power's intended targets, but also its effects. 67 Discourse, therefore, is socially productive for all subjects, constituting the subjectivity of all social beings of diverse kinds with their contingent, though not entirely fluid, identities, practices, rights, responsibilities, and social capacities. 68 Productive power, therefore, differs from structural power in its approach to subjectivity. Because structural power concerns the co-constitution of subjects, it typically envisions hierarchical and binary relations of domination that work to the advantage of those structurally empowered, to the disadvantage of the socially weak. In contrast, productive power concerns the boundaries of all social identity, and the capacity and inclination for action for the socially advantaged and disadvantaged alike, as well as the myriad social subjects that are not constituted in binary hierarchical relationships. 69 For a range of statements that address these differences, see Ball 1992 ; Barnes 1988 ; Benton 1981 ; Wartenberg 1992 ; and Isaac 1987 . Productive power, in this way, refuses to assume that some essence is at the root of human subjectivity, [and raises] the possibility that every ordering of social relations, and every ordering of social selves (every inter- and intrasubjective power relation) bears some cost in the form of violence it does to \u201cwhat it might be \u2018in the self and in the social world.\u2019 \u201d 70 Hayward 2000 , 6 (emphasis in the original). In general, the bases and workings of productive power are the socially existing and, hence, historically contingent and changing understandings, meanings, norms, customs, and social identities that make possible, limit, and are drawn on for action. 71 Ibid., 30. Some of the best examples of the analysis of productive power in international relations refer to the discursive production of the subjects, the fixing of meanings, and the terms of action, of world politics. One question concerns the kinds of subjects that are produced. Basic categories of classification, like \u201ccivilized,\u201d \u201crogue,\u201d \u201cEuropean,\u201d \u201cunstable,\u201d \u201cWestern,\u201d and \u201cdemocratic\u201d states, are representative of productive power, as they generate asymmetries of social capacities. 72 Even categories such as \u201cweapons of mass destruction\u201d can evolve in unexpected ways and stabilize meanings that constrain policy. 73 See Litwak 2002 ; and The New Republic , 7 October 2002, 22. A related theme is how the \u201cother\u201d comes to be defined and how that definition is associated with the practices and policies that are possible, imaginable, permissible, and desirable. 74 Also, socially contested efforts to set and fix meanings can be expressive of productive power. 75 A particular discourse of development orients action in one direction and away from others. 76 The gendered categories of \u201ccivilian\u201d and \u201ccombatant\u201d in international humanitarian law have real consequences for those on the ground, protecting some while putting others at the risk of death. 77 Thus to attend to the analysis of productive power is to focus on how diffuse and contingent social processes produce particular kinds of subjects, fix meanings and categories, and create what is taken for granted and the ordinary of world politics. The four concepts of power offer distinctive views about how actors' abilities to shape and set the conditions of their existence and action are affected and effected in international relations. Although each concept offers important insights into how power operates, a full accounting of power requires a consideration of its multiple forms operating in relation to each other. Our taxonomy does more than alert scholars to the different forms of power, though, for it also encourages a consideration of their conjunction. To demonstrate the value of our taxonomy for seeing the distinctive forms and the linkages between them, we consider two major issues in global politics\u2014global governance, and American empire. Scholars of global governance often define it as the institutionalized coordination or collaboration of people's and states' activities in ways that achieve more desirable\u2014positive sum\u2014outcomes. 78 Because of this tendency to tie global governance to institutionalized cooperation, coordination of convergent interests, and the production of collective goods, many scholars diminish or overlook the role of power. 79 This argument is developed in Hurrell 2005 . Yet governance is part of a family of concepts, including control, guidance, and steering, which are also elements of the family of \u201cpower\u201d concepts. Therefore, the scholarly tendency to slight how power operates in global governance is conceptually and theoretically problematic. Power is central to global governance, and our taxonomy highlights the multiple and interconnected ways in which it operates. International institutions, formal and informal, are often understood to be at the heart of global governance. Relations of cooperation and coordination, practices of international law, and the processes of collective action that they entail, are effected in and through institutions. Institutional power thus provides a reasonable conceptual starting point for examining power in global governance, and shapes global governance in at least three ways. First, any concern with global governance must consider what issues are of concern and which issues are not. For decades after World War II, issues of human rights, women's rights, and children's rights never made it on the UN agenda and thus were never discussed or even deemed worthy of \u201cgovernance.\u201d That is no longer the case. 80 Today, issues of collective responsibility for adequate employment or a livable wage for all people are institutionally excluded. One major goal of proponents of the new international economic order (NIEO) was to transform the issues that were debated and regulated in the global economy. 81 Agendas enable some actors to further their interests and ideals, to exercise control over others, and to limit the abilities of actors to engage in effective collective action. Second, a consideration of institutional power also exposes the governing biases of institutions. As we noted in the conceptual discussion above, the institutional rules that establish a particular focal point also serve to generate unequal leverage or influence in determining collective outcomes. 82 In short, the institutions that are established to help actors achieve pareto-superior outcomes also create \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers,\u201d to the extent that the ability to use the institution and, accordingly, collective rewards are unevenly distributed. 83 This institutional context, moreover, lingers into the future, thus constraining action in ways that might not have been intended but nevertheless limit choice and shape action. 84 This is precisely the point of considerable contemporary criticism of a number of formal organizations involved in governing the global economy, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 85 Recent analyses of the international refugee regime also have noted how legal and normative changes have potentially come at the expense of refugees. 86 Third, also consistent with the biases of institutions is the ability of great powers to establish international institutions and arrangements to further or preserve their interests and positions of advantage into the future, even as they do not directly or fully control those future arrangements. Gruber's concept and application of \u201cgo-it-alone\u201d power suggests how strong states undertake a course of action that subsequently shapes future outcomes for others, and that weak states go along with an agreement that may actually leave them worse off, because to oppose the inevitable will only cost them more in the long run. 87 In short, for Gruber, weaker states are damned if they do and doubly damned if they do not. Significantly, it is less important that the outcome is willfully intended than that it is an effect of asymmetrical ability to shape the context of choice or decision. Strange argued that while American power as defined by material resources might be in decline (at the time of her writing), the United States is the epicenter of a transnational empire that gives it the ability to shape security, financial, productive, and knowledge structures, which, in turn, operate to U.S. advantage and foreclose opportunities to other countries. 88 Ikenberry has argued that liberal great powers have attempted to use their positions of power after war to establish international governance mechanisms that simultaneously preserve and diffuse their power. 89 In sum, the institutional core of global governance, while seemingly resting on the production of joint gains through cooperation or coordination, also entails the substantial operation of institutional power. But institutional power, alone, does not tell the whole story. The example of great powers attempting to shape institutions suggests more traditional senses of \u201cpower struggles,\u201d which directs attention to compulsory power. Here, most obviously, the concern is with how states, and largely the great powers, are able to determine the content and direction of global governance by using their decisive material advantages not only to determine what areas are to be governed, but also to directly \u201ccoordinate\u201d the actions of lesser powers so that they align with their interests. 90 Other examples of this form of power include the U.S. efforts to determine the terms of the International Criminal Court by manipulating incentives for particular targeted states, and the special relationship established between European states and some of their former colonies with respect to international trade regime provisions. States, though, are not the only actors that have the ability to set and enforce the rules of global governance in ways that directly control the actions of others. International organizations sometimes do too, as they can be not only sites of institutional power through which other actors indirectly exercise control but also can exhibit compulsory power. 91 The World Bank's considerable potential for compulsory power vis-\u00e0-vis borrowing states with respect to \u201cdevelopment policy\u201d is illustrative. The UN High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR) can shape the life chances of refugees and other displaced peoples. 92 It is partly because of the recognition of the concentration of such resources for compulsory power in international organizations that many scholars and policymakers argue for a deconcentration of decisional authority, a substantial democratization of the institutions of global governance, or mechanisms of accountability. 93 Even some materially challenged actors are able to exercise compulsory power in global governance processes. Transnational activists, civil society organizations, and international nongovernmental organizations have demonstrated the ability to use rhetorical and symbolic tools, as well as shaming tactics, to get states, multinational corporations, and others to comply with the values and norms that they advance. 94 Various transnational activists successfully used symbolic means to press the Clinton administration to sign the landmine treaty. 95 Activists have formed associations and deployed branding and certification techniques to try to use consumer power to compel producers to comply with labor, environmental, and human rights standards. 96 Analysis of global governance needs to be attentive not only to the interactions of actors but also to the constitutive reproduction of the subjects of global social life. Gramscians and historical materialists have examined how global institutions help to stabilize and spread global governance that has a markedly liberal and capitalist character. 97 Also prominent here are studies that examine the mutually constituted structural relations of capital and labor\u2014and of core and periphery\u2014in global activities of material production, and how these structures generate a global distribution of material well-being and organize the mechanisms that facilitate, reproduce, regulate, and guard that distribution. 98 The actual workings of global governance, in this view, are reflective of the underlying global class structure, and the ideologies of global governance help to reproduce that structure by fostering a worldview among the exploited classes that either there is no alternative or the current social order is desirable. 99 The concept of productive power as applied to global governance highlights how the discourses and institutions of international relations contingently produce particular kinds of actors with associated social powers, self-understandings, and performative practices. Consider the Global Compact, which \u201cengages the private sector to work with the UN, in partnership with international labor and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), to identify, disseminate, and promote good corporate practices based on nine universal principles\u201d that are found in various UN documents. 100 Because this ambitious agenda is undertaken by a slimly funded and staffed unit attached to the secretariat-general's office, it is not an obvious place to look for evidence of power, even if the goal is to alter corporate practices. Yet the architects of the Global Compact imagine two distinctive mechanisms that might foster this development, and these mechanisms are expressions of productive power. One, as multinational corporations sign onto a set of (evolving) standards and practices, a discursive space is opened in which various actors are produced as subjects empowered legitimately to comment on their performance. Those actors are thereby given social resources that enable them effectively to exercise the compulsory power of shaming corporations into changing their behavior. Additionally, the discourse of the Global Compact also aspires to create a new kind of actor\u2014the potentially \u201csocially responsible corporation\u201d\u2014that may adhere to these best practices not because of the manipulation of incentives, but rather because of a new self-understanding. 101 In other words, the discourse is intended to produce a new \u201csocial kind\u201d that will be self-regulating and self-disciplining. The production of this new social kind is hypothesized to occur through various mechanisms. To begin, they are expected to translate pertinent UN principles, which are legitimated by the international community and draw from broader discourses of liberalism, into lessons learned that can be transformed into best practices. To encourage this process, the Global Compact has created a learning network that, ultimately, is \u201cintended to stimulate the internationalization of UN principles into companies' corporate cultures.\u201d 102 Ibid. This lengthy process will depend on the willingness of corporations to adopt new texts, business models, and practices that ultimately become internalized and identified with the performance of this new social identity, the socially responsible corporation. The Global Compact, therefore, illuminates the workings of, and connections between, different forms of power: compulsory power because of the ability of nonstate actors to deploy shaming techniques to alter corporate practices; institutional power because of the role of the UN in establishing new rules that can constrain the behavior of corporations; and productive power because of the attempt to help produce a new social kind of corporate actor. The productive power of the Global Compact discourse, although important in its own right, is merely illustrative of the broad significance of productive power in global governance. Indeed, all practices of guiding and steering collective outcomes in global social life, with the possible and partial exception of instances of compulsory power effected through relations of raw coercive force and violence, derive from discourses that are productive of the social identities of the actors engaged in them. The human rights regime, for example, is an expression of a discursively constituted world populated by subjects normalized as human rights victims, human rights monitors, human rights violators, and human rights prosecutors. To analyze global governance processes adequately, then, it is necessary to address systematically the workings of productive power in setting the conditions of meaningful collective action. Understanding the operation of power in multiple forms makes it much more difficult to approach global governance purely in terms of cooperation, coordination, consensus, and normative progress. Governance is also a matter of compulsion, institutional bias, privilege, and unequal constraints on action. Although these different concepts of power illuminate different ways in which power operates in global governance, there is an important difference between the first two and the last two that affects how we think about governance: the first two concern who governs in global governance, whereas the latter two concern not who governs, but instead how the governing capacities of actors are produced, how those capacities shape governance processes and outcomes, and how bodies of knowledge create subjects that are to be, at least in part, self-regulating and disciplined. 103 Our taxonomy does more than simply illuminate the different ways power operates in global governance, for it also encourages scholars to identify connections between these forms. If scholars of global governance have tended to underestimate the role of power in any of its forms, there is no such danger regarding the contemporary debate about the existence, nature, and consequences of U.S. empire. The U.S. response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, President George W. Bush's 2002 National Security Strategy, and the U.S. occupation of Iraq have caused scholars and pundits to debate whether the United States is an empire. 104 The generic concern is with the informal or formal hierarchical arrangements that maintain the domination of one actor over others. See Shaw 2002 , 331\u201332, and Doyle 1986 for a general discussion, and Rosen 2003 for application of the concept to the contemporary United States. Their evaluations frequently turn on sometimes loose, but certainly varied, usages of the concept. We do not intend to provide the definitive concept of empire and then use that concept to determine whether or not the label applies to the United States. Instead, our modest goal is to demonstrate that any systematic discussion of empire must consider power in multiple forms. Much of the debate over the existence and nature of American empire pivots off of what we have called compulsory power. It could hardly be otherwise. A fundamental issue, after all, is the U.S.'s ability and willingness to use its overwhelming concentration of resources to shape directly the actions of others. For many observers, the decision to designate the United States as an empire rests on its apparent quest to use coercion and intimidation if and when necessary to develop and sustain its supremacy over other regions and states. The emphasis on direct control over others certainly corresponds to the concept of compulsory power, but our concept does raise questions regarding whether the designation of empire should be dependent on intentions and brass-knuckle tactics. Much of the recent discussion over the United States as an empire revolves around its intentions. After all, although the U.S. global share of material resources has not changed significantly during the past decade, what has changed, according to many, is the Bush administration's determination to use its unrivaled position to strong-arm others and to scare away possible challengers. This is one reason why much is made of the Bush administration's 2002 National Security Strategy; it appears to announce loudly and boldly its goal of maintaining an empire in form if not in name. But, should intentionality be the metric for determining the existence of empire? As we have shown, compulsory power does not hinge on intentionality; it still operates even when those who directly dominate others are not conscious of how their actions are producing unintended effects. A state that has no intention of creating or maintaining an empire, per se, might nevertheless exercise directly controlling effects that are nearly identical to those who do. To the extent that compulsory power is the key, then, evidence of empire may best be found not in the intentions of the subject but instead in the consequences as viewed from the objects of the empire. The concept of compulsory power also questions whether the reliance on coercive means is necessary for the designation of empire. Compulsory power concerns the direct control of others, but admits for a range of technologies that allow A to control the behavior and circumstances of B. Consequently, although empires use military means, they also can be expected to use less coercive tactics. Doing so might not make them any less of an empire, a point emphasized by Carr in his discussion of the colonial empires. 105 The relevance of thinking about noncoercive mechanisms is quite germane to the tendency, among some scholars, to highlight the perceived willingness of the Bush administration to forgo multilateral means in favor of unilateral instruments as evidence of the bid for empire. 106 In other words, for such analysts it is the shift from a grand strategy revolving around institutional power to one founded primarily on compulsory power that best signals the new status of the United States as empire. The backdrop to this argument is an interpretation of what accounts for the longevity of American hegemony after World War II and how it differed from previous hegemonies, including the colonial empires it supplanted. The genius of the post\u2013World War II \u201cwise men,\u201d in this way, was to recognize that global rule through coercion was unsustainable, and that it was preferable to establish global institutions that could further American interests and spread American values. 107 What generated consent for American hegemony was not only agreement over the purpose of American power, but also the construction of multilateral institutions that were conferred legitimacy, constrained American power, and democratized the decision-making process. Because these global institutions had some autonomy from the United States and were partly controlled by other states, the United States could not be said to possess them, even though they reflected American interests. What separates American hegemony from American empire in this view, therefore, is the willingness to work jointly with others through multilateral institutions and the consent that is attended to them. 108 The Bush administration's decision to shift the weight of American foreign policy from multilateral to unilateral mechanisms provides partial cause for observers to relabel the United States an imperial power. But it is important to recognize how American hegemony, even when run through global institutions, still represented an exercise of institutional power. The absence of overt conflict does not mean the absence of power; institutions can mobilize bias to serve U.S. purposes and eliminate points of potential opposition to serve U.S. concerns. Moreover, global institutions created an asymmetrical distribution of benefits, and the United States has been a prime beneficiary. It is partly for this reason that Bacevich claims that the nature of the American empire since World War II has revolved around global institutions that create \u201copen spaces\u201d that the United States can dominate. 109 Finally, and most importantly, the United States still exercises power, but now it is indirect and mediated through institutions. Any consideration of the American empire, in short, must be attentive to institutional power. In this respect, perhaps at stake is not whether the United States is or is not an empire, but rather whether the longevity of that empire is dependent on the willingness to eschew unilateral means of control for indirect institutional means\u2014a point that echoes earlier debates over the nature of informal empires. 110 Yet to what extent should the debate about the American empire focus exclusively on the specificity of the United States as an actor? Compulsory and institutional power directs attention to empire as an extension of a centralized, territorial state that maintains control over others, and thus focuses on the policies of the United States in general and the Bush administration in particular. Structural and productive power, however, shift the focus away from particular actors that control, directly or indirectly, others to social relations of constitution. In doing so, it directs attention to the underlying social relations that make possible an assumption of imperial power, give meaning to U.S. foreign policy practices, and imagine empire as having a decentralized, even deterritorialized, form. To consider structural power in debating the existence or implications of U.S. empire means, first and foremost, exploring the structural constitution of the United States as imperial center. This has three interconnected aspects. First, the structure of social relations of material production are transnational and create functional and spatial differentiation between a world-economic core and periphery. Along these lines, scholars influenced by Marxism and world-system theory generally situate their discussions of U.S. foreign policy in the context of how global capitalism generates a particular set of social positions and practices for the United States in direct relationship to the structurally disadvantaged. 111 Such a consideration frequently includes a claim that a partially deterritorialized global capitalism constitutes the United States as a capitalist state that is bound up with the authoritative rule of and for global capital. 112 This leads to a second observation: because capitalism is global and deterritorialized, so, too, is global rule. 113 Although the United States might play an important role in regulating the world economy, opening up new territories, and ensuring that rogue countries are disciplined, it works with other states and nonstate actors to maintain and expand global capitalism. 114 Third, the regulation of the world economy is accomplished through a mixture of coercion and consent. The United States has demonstrated a willingness to use its military power to maintain global economic (and associated sociopolitical) stability. It also has worked hard to generate consent\u2014that is, to get those who are structurally disadvantaged because of their position in the world political economy to accept the order of things. Accordingly, entering into the debate on U.S. empire through the lens of structural power leads one to a focus on the structural constitution of the conditions of possibility for the Bush administration's policies in relationship to the material, political, and ideological contradictions of capitalism. 115 Can the social relations of constitution that generate empire be understood in the more diffuse terms of productive power? A most influential, recent, attempt is Hardt and Negri's definition of \u201cempire,\u201d which has been the subject of much critical attention. Their argument is that transformative discursive and material processes have produced \u201cempire\u201d: a \u201cdecentered and deterritorializing apparatus of rule that progressively incorporates the entire global realm within its open, expanding, frontiers.\u201d 116 What has produced this new form of global rule? Although they join others in identifying the expansion of global capital, they also locate an important role for the development of Western-backed institutions that maintain more consensual and participatory decision-making practices, new discourses such as human rights, equality, and democracy, and counterhegemonic struggles by labor and others that reflect the desire for \u201cliberation\u201d from the \u201cmodern machines of power.\u201d 117 Ibid., 43. Empire, as they conceive it, is not a system in which tribute, power, and resources flow from the outlying regions to a great metropolitan center, but instead consists of more diffuse networks of hierarchy that generate privilege for some and pacify the multitudes. How does this deterritorialized empire constitute the United States? Broadly, social discourses might be viewed as productive of the specific subjectivity of the United States in relationship to imperial subjects. Some circles, for example, exhibit a growing romantic nostalgia for empire. 118 It is not uncommon to hear the United States being urged to accept the responsibilities and burdens of empire in helping to bring progress to others. 119 USA Today , 6 May 2003, A15. This role is to be performed not only by the United States. A multiplicity of actors and processes are partially responsible for attempting to bring progress, development, human rights, and the rule of law\u2014in short, civilization\u2014to the non-Western world. Along these lines, Judis observed that while there was the formal dismantling of the colonial empires that once played a civilizing mission that stabilized the international order, that role is now shouldered by international organizations. 120 New Republic , 9 June 2003, 19\u201323. He proceeded to recommend that the United States continue to use international organizations to perform this civilizing mission, anticipating that they will be better able to bring into being new kinds of actors in world politics. Productive power, in this way, works to produce a particular identity for the United States\u2014a responsible and beneficent imperial actor in relation to others (imperial subjects, themselves irresponsible and in need of such help). In general, any discussion of American empire should be attentive to all forms of power. Certainly there is compulsory power, which is the focus of much of the debate. Yet also present is institutional power and how the United States might indirectly control the behavior of others through global institutions. These first two approaches share, therefore, a concern with how the United States is able to sustain dominance in international affairs in ways that control, directly and indirectly, the foreign policies and even domestic political arrangements of other states. It is possible and desirable, though, to see the American empire as constituted by global social relations. Making this move requires a willingness to see the United States at the imperial center, structurally constituted and discursively produced through a complex of imperial relations that are not themselves fully under the control of the U.S. state as actor. To fully appreciate how power is embedded in empire, though, requires a willingness to see not only the different forms of power, but also how they combine in different ways to create structured and enduring hierarchies of control and advantage. Power is a complex and contested concept, in large part because there are important but distinctive ways to understand how social relations shape the fates and choices of actors. If international relations scholars have erred in their past attempts to understand power, it is by trying to identify and rely on a single conception. But no single concept can capture the forms of power in international politics. In order to better enable scholars to see the conceptual variety, we constructed a taxonomy that systematically identifies the different forms of power. We use that taxonomy to encourage scholars not to treat these conceptual forms as competing or vying for recognition as the important operation of power in a particular situation. Instead, we urge scholars to see how the multiple concepts capture the different and interrelated ways in which actors are enabled and constrained in determining their circumstances. The inevitable question, then, is how exactly should we think about the relationship between these forms of power? During the past few years, there have been several important statements regarding how scholars should conceptualize the relationship between different substantive theories of international relations, such as neoliberalism and realism, and different social theories, such as constructivism and rationalism. 121 Jupille, Caporaso, and Checkel suggest several possibilities: incommensurability; competitive testing; sequencing; incorporation (or subsumption); and some type of addition. 122 With respect to analysis of power, we reject the first four in favor of the last. One line of argument is that because these different conceptualizations of power derive, in important ways, from different social theoretic commitments, they are incommensurable. Because the theoretic foundations are in tension, the best that can be gotten among concepts of power is some form of conceptual pluralism. We certainly do not believe that a \u201cmaster\u201d theory of power is possible. But there is no social theoretic reason why scholars should not look for areas of connection. We also reject a gladiatorial competition between these conceptions; after all, they capture the different ways in which social relations shape and limit actors' ability to determine their fates. To permanently reject one in favor of another, therefore, would be to risk overlooking a fundamental dimension of power (and therefore return discussions of power to a state of conceptual myopia). We also reject subsumption arguments, on the grounds that they presuppose that there is a foundational element of power that is generative of the other forms. We see ways in which compulsory power shapes productive power, and vice-versa; how institutional power shapes compulsory power, and vice-versa; how institutional power shapes structural power, and vice-versa, and on and on. So, there is no most basic form. On the same grounds, we reject the idea of sequencing because we see no reason to presume that one form of power necessarily and always precedes another. To the contrary, in most social contexts all are operating simultaneously, intersecting with and reflecting off of each other. Because the taxonomy was designed to encourage scholars to see the different forms of power in international politics and the connections between them, we strongly encourage scholars to imagine how different forms interact to sharpen empirical analysis. Different forms of power have different domains of application to the extent that they illuminate different ways in which social relations affect and effect the ability of actors to control their fates. 123 For a related argument, see Baldwin 2002 , 178. But, as we illustratively suggested in the discussions of global governance and American empire, these different conceptualizations are not only distinct, but also intertwined. Although Carr is routinely considered to be the individual most responsible for establishing the focal conceptualization of power and associating that conceptualization with realism, in our view his work in fact suggests what we are advocating. 124 As expected from someone deeply influenced by Mannheim and Marx, his Twenty Years' Crisis and his analysis of international order exhibit a far-reaching understanding of what power does and how power works. He certainly articulated various elements of compulsory power. His explicit discussion of power was largely limited to its multiple instruments (for him military force, economic wealth, and public opinion or propaganda) that could be used to overcome resistance from another \u201cpolitical society.\u201d Yet he also attended to features of institutional power as he saw how power works through international institutions, including international law, which, in turn, shape the policies of states and help to legitimate and sustain international orders. In Carr's view, international organizations, such as the League of Nations and emergent principles of international law, institutionalize the interests of the powerful and work against those of the weak. His critique of the League of Nations, therefore, included more than the standard (but false) criticism that its architects and advocates believed that somehow it would magically erase the causes of war; it also included the claim that these international institutions that embodied so-called universal principles, in fact, maintain the international status quo at the expense of some in the service of others. The hubris of idealists, Carr argued, is to believe that somehow these international institutions are antidotes to power and represent a positive-sum game. Indeed, for Carr, it was the very fact that they mask relations of power that transforms them into stealth weapons of domination. As a student of Marx, Carr also saw power as structural\u2014as including social processes that define state interests themselves. Drawing inspiration from Marxian theories of false consciousness, for example, he claimed that ideologies such as free trade are part of power politics precisely because they can lead indoctrinated states to consent to new forms of economic relations that insert them into new relations of dependence and exploitation. International orders are easier to sustain for the powerful if the dominated submit to their own domination, Carr acknowledged clearly and explicitly. Finally, as someone who was influenced by Mannheim, he was keenly aware of how broad discourses such as \u201cprogress,\u201d carried by intellectuals and established institutions, constitute what are acceptable practices and goals (always trying but never quite eradicating power) and shape broader categories of \u201ccivilized\u201d and \u201cuncivilized\u201d states. Carr reminds us that power exists at the surface, and also well below; he shows that to understand power means to understand its various forms. As scholars of international relations continue to debate the nature, role, and explanatory significance of power, they should recognize the workings of multiple concepts and systematically employ them in their research. After all, that is the way Carr would have wanted it. Abbott , Kenneth , and Duncan Snidal . 1998 . Why States Act Through Formal International Organizations .

I felt that under the circumstances, it was the only thing I could do. I had long felt that she had damaged me with emotional abuse while I was growing up, and during my adulthood she continued to treat me in ways I didn't like. I became so emotionally and physically stressed when I was with her that it affected my health. So I made the difficult yet necessary decision to stop seeing her. The estrangement lasted three years. During that time, I wrote a book titled Divorcing a Parent , in which I told about the experience of divorcing my mother and encouraged others in similar situations to consider doing the same. Then one day the phone rang. When I picked it up the person on the other end of the line said, \"I'm sorry.\" It was my mother. Waves of relief washed over me. Resentment, fear and anger drained out. Much to my surprise, those two simple words seemed to wipe away years of pain and bitterness. They were the words I had been waiting to hear most of my life.\nI knew that it had taken all the courage my extremely proud mother could muster to say them, so I didn't have to belabor the point. The important thing was that she was saying she was sorry\u2014something she'd never done before. I could tell by the tone of her voice that she truly regretted the way she had treated me.\nOf course, this was only the beginning of the story. Although I believed her apology, I didn't yet know if her behavior toward me would be different. This I tested over time. But by apologizing she had acknowledged that I had a reason to be hurt and angry, and that was extremely empowering for me.\nApology changed my life. I believe it can change yours, as well. Almost like magic, apology has the power to repair harm, mend relationships, soothe wounds and heal broken hearts.\nApology is not just a social nicety. It is an important ritual, a way of showing respect and empathy for the wronged person. It is also a way of acknowledging an act that, if otherwise left unnoticed, might compromise the relationship. Apology has the ability to disarm others of their anger and to prevent further misunderstandings. While an apology cannot undo harmful past actions, if done sincerely and effectively, it can undo the negative effects of those actions.\nApology is crucial to our mental and even physical health. Research shows that receiving an apology has a noticeable, positive physical effect on the body. An apology actually affects the bodily functions of the person receiving it\u2014blood pressure decreases, heart rate slows and breathing becomes steadier.\n- A person who has been harmed feels emotional healing when he is acknowledged by the wrongdoer.\n- When we receive an apology, we no longer perceive the wrongdoer as a personal threat.\n- Apology helps us to move past our anger and prevents us from being stuck in the past.\n- Apology opens the door to forgiveness by allowing us to have empathy for the wrongdoer.\n- The debilitating effects of the remorse and shame we may feel when we've hurt another person can eat away at us until we become emotionally and physically ill. By apologizing and taking responsibility for our actions we help rid ourselves of esteem-robbing self-reproach and guilt .\n- Apology has the power to humble even the most arrogant. When we develop the courage to admit we are wrong and work past our resistance to apologizing, we develop a deep sense of self-respect.\n- Apologizing helps us remain emotionally connected to our friends and loved ones. Knowing we have wronged someone may cause us to distance ourselves from the person, but once we have apologized we feel freer to be vulnerable and intimate.\n- And there is another little-talked-about benefit: Since apologizing usually causes us to feel humiliated, it can also act as a deterrent, reminding us to not repeat the act.\nTo forgive, most people need to gain some empathy and compassion for the wrongdoer. This is where apology comes in. When someone apologizes, it is a lot easier to view him or her in a compassionate way. When wrongdoers apologize, we find it easier to forgive them.\nThis is likely because when someone confesses to and apologizes for hurting us, we are then able to develop a new image of that person. Instead of seeing him through anger and bitterness, the person's humility and apology cause us to see him as a fallible, vulnerable human being. We see the wrongdoer as more human, more like ourselves and this moves us.\nMichael E. McCullough, Ph.D., Steven J. Sandage, M.S., and Everett L. Worthington Jr., Ph.D., examined whether the effect of apology on our capacity to forgive is due to our increased empathy toward an apologetic offender. They discovered that much of why people find it easy to forgive an apologetic wrongdoer is that apology and confession increase empathy, which heightens the ability to forgive.\nMcCullough, who is the director of research at the privately funded National Institute for Healthcare Research in Rockville, Maryland, believes that apology encourages forgiveness by eliciting sympathy. He and his colleagues published research in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology that supports this hypothesis.\nThe first study, of 131 female and 108 male college students, looked at whether people who forgave are more conciliatory toward, and less avoidant of, their offender. Participants filled out questionnaires describing an event in which someone had hurt them, how they were hurt, how wrong they felt the offender was and the extent to which the offender apologized.\nMcCullough and his colleagues then measured the degree of empathy participants felt toward the offending person, the degree to which they'd forgiven the offender, the degree to which participants had tried to reconcile with the offender and the degree to which participants avoided the offender.\nThe data supported the hypothesis that an apology leads to empathy and empathy mediates forgiveness.\nThere are also two important underlying aspects of an apology\u2014intention and attitude. These are communicated nonverbally to the person to whom you are apologizing. If your apology does not come sincerely, it will not feel meaningful to the other person.\nFor the person you have wronged to feel this sincerity, the desire to apologize must come from within. You should never attempt an apology because someone else tells you it is the right thing to do, because the other person is expecting it or because it will get you what you want. Apologies that are used as manipulations or mere social gestures will come across as empty and meaningless.\nApology, when sincere and intentional, is a powerful, perhaps even life-altering, tool for both the giver and the receiver.\nApology has indeed changed my life. My mother lived only three more years. But because she was able to offer an apology, and because I was able to accept her apology, we were closer in those three years than we had ever been. Our time together was extremely healing for both of us.\nIf you have difficulties apologizing, the following will teach you the most effective way to go about it. A meaningful apology communicates the three R's: regret, responsibility and remedy.\nRegret : statement of regret for having caused the hurt or damage\nWhile your intention may not have been to cause harm, you recognize that your action or inaction nevertheless did hurt this person. This regret needs to be communicated. This includes an expression of empathy with an acknowledgement of the injustice you caused.\nResponsibility : an acceptance of responsibility for your actions\nThis means not blaming anyone else and not making excuses for what you did. For an apology to be effective it must be clear that you are accepting total responsibility for your action or inaction. Therefore, your apology needs to include a statement of responsibility.\nRemedy : a statement of willingness to remedy the situation\nWhile you can't undo the past, you can repair the harm you caused. Therefore, a meaningful apology needs to include a statement in which you offer restitution, or a promise to take action so that you will not repeat the behavior.\nUnless all three of these elements are present, the other person will sense that something is missing in your apology and he or she may feel shortchanged.\nWith permission of the publisher, John Wiley & Sons, from The Power of Apology , by Beverly Engel.", "source_raw_text": "By Beverly Engel published July 1, 2002 - last reviewed on June 9, 2016 When I was 35 years old, I divorced my mother.

I knew that it had taken all the courage my extremely proud mother could muster to say them, so I didn't have to belabor the point. The important thing was that she was saying she was sorry\u2014something she'd never done before. I could tell by the tone of her voice that she truly regretted the way she had treated me. Of course, this was only the beginning of the story. Although I believed her apology, I didn't yet know if her behavior toward me would be different. This I tested over time. But by apologizing she had acknowledged that I had a reason to be hurt and angry, and that was extremely empowering for me. Apology changed my life. I believe it can change yours, as well. Almost like magic, apology has the power to repair harm, mend relationships, soothe wounds and heal broken hearts. Apology is not just a social nicety. It is an important ritual, a way of showing respect and empathy for the wronged person. It is also a way of acknowledging an act that, if otherwise left unnoticed, might compromise the relationship. Apology has the ability to disarm others of their anger and to prevent further misunderstandings. While an apology cannot undo harmful past actions, if done sincerely and effectively, it can undo the negative effects of those actions. Apology is crucial to our mental and even physical health. Research shows that receiving an apology has a noticeable, positive physical effect on the body. An apology actually affects the bodily functions of the person receiving it\u2014blood pressure decreases, heart rate slows and breathing becomes steadier. A person who has been harmed feels emotional healing when he is acknowledged by the wrongdoer. When we receive an apology, we no longer perceive the wrongdoer as a personal threat. Apology helps us to move past our anger and prevents us from being stuck in the past. Apology opens the door to forgiveness by allowing us to have empathy for the wrongdoer. The debilitating effects of the remorse and shame we may feel when we've hurt another person can eat away at us until we become emotionally and physically ill. By apologizing and taking responsibility for our actions we help rid ourselves of esteem-robbing self-reproach and guilt . Apology has the power to humble even the most arrogant. When we develop the courage to admit we are wrong and work past our resistance to apologizing, we develop a deep sense of self-respect. Apologizing helps us remain emotionally connected to our friends and loved ones. Knowing we have wronged someone may cause us to distance ourselves from the person, but once we have apologized we feel freer to be vulnerable and intimate. And there is another little-talked-about benefit: Since apologizing usually causes us to feel humiliated, it can also act as a deterrent, reminding us to not repeat the act. To forgive, most people need to gain some empathy and compassion for the wrongdoer. This is where apology comes in. When someone apologizes, it is a lot easier to view him or her in a compassionate way. When wrongdoers apologize, we find it easier to forgive them. This is likely because when someone confesses to and apologizes for hurting us, we are then able to develop a new image of that person. Instead of seeing him through anger and bitterness, the person's humility and apology cause us to see him as a fallible, vulnerable human being. We see the wrongdoer as more human, more like ourselves and this moves us. Michael E. McCullough, Ph.D., Steven J. Sandage, M.S., and Everett L. Worthington Jr., Ph.D., examined whether the effect of apology on our capacity to forgive is due to our increased empathy toward an apologetic offender. They discovered that much of why people find it easy to forgive an apologetic wrongdoer is that apology and confession increase empathy, which heightens the ability to forgive. McCullough, who is the director of research at the privately funded National Institute for Healthcare Research in Rockville, Maryland, believes that apology encourages forgiveness by eliciting sympathy. He and his colleagues published research in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology that supports this hypothesis. The first study, of 131 female and 108 male college students, looked at whether people who forgave are more conciliatory toward, and less avoidant of, their offender. Participants filled out questionnaires describing an event in which someone had hurt them, how they were hurt, how wrong they felt the offender was and the extent to which the offender apologized. McCullough and his colleagues then measured the degree of empathy participants felt toward the offending person, the degree to which they'd forgiven the offender, the degree to which participants had tried to reconcile with the offender and the degree to which participants avoided the offender. The data supported the hypothesis that an apology leads to empathy and empathy mediates forgiveness. There are also two important underlying aspects of an apology\u2014intention and attitude. These are communicated nonverbally to the person to whom you are apologizing. If your apology does not come sincerely, it will not feel meaningful to the other person. For the person you have wronged to feel this sincerity, the desire to apologize must come from within. You should never attempt an apology because someone else tells you it is the right thing to do, because the other person is expecting it or because it will get you what you want. Apologies that are used as manipulations or mere social gestures will come across as empty and meaningless. Apology, when sincere and intentional, is a powerful, perhaps even life-altering, tool for both the giver and the receiver. Apology has indeed changed my life. My mother lived only three more years. But because she was able to offer an apology, and because I was able to accept her apology, we were closer in those three years than we had ever been. Our time together was extremely healing for both of us. If you have difficulties apologizing, the following will teach you the most effective way to go about it. A meaningful apology communicates the three R's: regret, responsibility and remedy. Regret : statement of regret for having caused the hurt or damage While your intention may not have been to cause harm, you recognize that your action or inaction nevertheless did hurt this person. This regret needs to be communicated. This includes an expression of empathy with an acknowledgement of the injustice you caused. Responsibility : an acceptance of responsibility for your actions This means not blaming anyone else and not making excuses for what you did. For an apology to be effective it must be clear that you are accepting total responsibility for your action or inaction. Therefore, your apology needs to include a statement of responsibility. Remedy : a statement of willingness to remedy the situation While you can't undo the past, you can repair the harm you caused. Therefore, a meaningful apology needs to include a statement in which you offer restitution, or a promise to take action so that you will not repeat the behavior. Unless all three of these elements are present, the other person will sense that something is missing in your apology and he or she may feel shortchanged.

She\u2019d had an email from an investigative journalist accusing her of taking drugs, being drunk and dancing with a famous violinist, all \u201cin front of journalists\u201d. It was done to shame her. Instead of running away from it, she published the email, adding that the incident sounded \u201chighly probable\u201d and that she was pretty sure it was not the \u201conly incident of the kind\u201d. She apologised \u201cto any and all journalists who were forced to watch me dance that night\u201d. A little bit of humour did her no harm, but the power was in her ownership of the incident, leaving no ammunition with which to take further aim at her.\nSorrys are not dissimilar to thank-yous. Both are small but mighty. So much grace and joy can be handed over if you use them with meaning, and they can both deliver much misery and hurt if misused, or not used at all.\nSometimes, however, people make an apology but it comes too late or is too small, and it can feel hard to accept or move on. Questions to ask yourself here would be: instead of making the sorry the end of something, could it be the beginning of a bigger discussion, along the lines of, \u201cWhat do I need to do to make it better?\u201d or \u201cCan anything make it better?\u201d If the answer to the latter is \u201cno\u201d, perhaps the sorry is being asked to do too much heavy lifting right then. Time may be needed for healing. But can it start without sorry? I don\u2019t think so.\nI\u2019m writing a series of children\u2019s books. One is about saying sorry: the protagonist fears that every time they do so, a piece of them goes with the apology and they will lose themselves. The opposite is true \u2013 with every genuine sorry, we grow, the other person grows, and so does the connection between us.\nSeries two of the Conversations with Annalisa Barbieri podcast is out now\nI hope you appreciated this article.

Thank you.\nBetsy Reed\nEditor, Guardian US", "source_raw_text": "From the kneejerk to the insincere, there are many kinds of apologies. But which ones count? Here\u2019s how to get it right \u2013 and why it matters I t had been 20 years since I\u2019d seen my aunt. In that time I\u2019d lived a full life, written a book and had a baby, but as she stared at my bottom, I knew what she was thinking. Then she said it: \u201cAre you competing with Mary?\u201d There was some skill here: in a few words, she\u2019d deftly managed to insult both my cousin and me. The subtext was: you\u2019ve got as fat as her. Fuelled by post-partum hormones, I decided to tell my aunt, for the first time, how insulting I found this. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, \u201cif you chose to take offence at what I said.\u201d Ah. The apology rendered immediately void by the word if . Expecting any apology at all was ambitious, because I come from a family who largely can\u2019t and don\u2019t apologise (strange, given we are all Catholics). The sorrys are either histrionic and overplayed, or never manifest \u2013 the idea being, I guess, that if you don\u2019t say sorry, did it even happen? I\u2019ve also always been confused at the very English \u201cnever apologise never explain,\u201d maxim, supposedly a sign of status. Because of all this, I\u2019ve had a lifelong fascination with apologies, and a lot of them, including my own, are sometimes lacking. Why is this? Why is it so hard to say sorry? There are several types of apology. The automatic \u201cSorry I bumped into you\u201d; the \u201cSorry, after you\u201d in a queue; and the very British sorry for someone else\u2019s misdemeanour, like when they stand on your toe. We say a lot of these silly sorrys. There\u2019s also sorry said in sympathy or sorry to sympathise: \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sorry: that sounds hard.\u201d But the sorry that matters is the one aimed at healing hurt \u2013 when we recognise we\u2019ve done wrong and want to make amends. This is not an easy sorry. It requires more than mere vocabulary, which is why teaching children to say sorry by saying \u201cSay sorry\u201d is not a robust parenting tool. The ingredients for a good apology are: authenticity, recognition, empathy, ability to take responsibility, and, finally, a good dose of vulnerability and humble pie. It\u2019s a grownups\u2019 word, yet few grownups use it well. If it lacks these things, it doesn\u2019t \u201cland\u201d, said child and adolescent psychotherapist Alison Roy. This is why we so often feel short-changed after an apology, especially an official one: we were wronged with the original fault, and wronged again in the supposed apology. In fact, we can end up feeling manipulated. Corporate-speak is now so clever: we are apologised to with such regularity, yet never feel anyone has really said sorry. Train companies: I\u2019m looking at you. \u201cAn apology has to be meaningful if anyone, but especially children, is going to make sense of it,\u201d said Roy. \u201cIt should be a way to reconnect [with the person you\u2019ve wronged]. But coping with feelings of shame, of having got something wrong, of being a flawed human being, is quite a sophisticated thing. These are not easy emotions and experiences, so we can\u2019t just expect our children to understand by giving them a word. We have to model it for them.\u201d In other words, we need to practise what we preach. It\u2019s important to start with children because it is usually in childhood that most of us learn to say sorry, or not. It tends to be either modelled well, or not at all. We realise how it leaves us feeling \u2013 wretched \u2013 and resolve to do better.If we learn to say sorry without thought, all we learn is that sorry is a quick way to get off the hook. There\u2019s no reflection. This often leads to an apology with no change in behaviour, which is pointless and infuriating. And forcing anyone, especially a child, to say sorry to an audience without first finding out what happened can lead to resentment and humiliation: never good in a growing brain. I once taught a writing workshop in a secondary school. One day I did something wrong and said: \u201cGosh, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d The class fell silent. \u201cTeachers never say sorry to us, miss,\u201d they told me. This is a common lament among young people: \u201cAdults expect us to say sorry but they never do.\u201d You have only to listen to debates in parliament to tell the good apologies from the bad, and hear how very \u201cplayground\u201d some of them sound. In the past 12 months there have been 1,812 \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201ds from both houses, and counting (the House of Commons tips the Lords at 1090/722), and 1,273 \u201cI apologise\u201ds. Most of these are mere punctuation, and in the case of Boris Johnson, even when he does apologise \u2013 and he apologises more than people think \u2013 and uses good phrases such as \u201cI take full responsibility\u201d and \u201cI am truly sorry\u201d, it just doesn\u2019t \u201cland\u201d. I often wonder how Johnson was taught to apologise as a child. It\u2019s rather shocking how many of these apologies try to shift the real responsibility: \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d followed by a conjunction (if/but/that). Examples include: \u201cI\u2019m sorry that you feel that way,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sorry if you took offence.\u201d Familiar, aren\u2019t they? That\u2019s because they are everywhere. Hansard is full of things like, \u201cI\u2019m very sorry to the noble Baroness \u2026 that she feels that way.\u201dIs that really being sorry? \u201cIt\u2019s the worst kind of apology,\u201d said mediator and conflict resolution expert Gabrielle Rifkind. \u201cSaying \u2018I\u2019m sorry you feel that way\u2019 is not a genuine apology. It\u2019s not taking responsibility for your actions; it\u2019s putting the blame back to [the wronged person].\u201d Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind the scenes look at the making of the magazine\u2019s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights. Rifkind once gave me a wonderful tip about building bridges. It involved starting with words to the effect of: \u201cYou really matter to me and I want to work out what has gone wrong, so I\u2019m going to do nothing but listen to you for the next 15 minutes.\u201d When was the last time someone said that to you? Exactly, but it\u2019s seductive isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m not sure I would even need an apology with that sort of starter. But it is hard to apologise if we fear reprisals: fear and shame are the enemies of a confident apology. To bloom, apologies need safety and the prospect of being understood. Safety is often lacking because we fear that saying sorry could cost us our relationship, our job or a heap of money. One of the things we\u2019re taught as new drivers is \u201cdon\u2019t admit fault\u201d if there\u2019s an accident, even if it is your fault. Psychoanalyst Stephen Blumenthal thinks authentic apologies are more likely in \u201chorizontal, more democratic relationships\u201d \u2013 if the person saying sorry and the person wronged are on the same level \u2013 than in a more vertical relationship such as boss and employee. This is why siblings and co-workers are more likely to admit to wrongdoing to each other than to parents or bosses, unless of course, they fear being ratted out. \u201cA genuine sorry,\u201d he said, \u201cemanates from a place of wanting to validate and care for the other person, not shame them. We live in a culture of inquisition rather than inquiry, more concerned with identifying a person with an action [of wrongdoing] than curiosity about what\u2019s gone wrong or why.\u201d Some people see it as a sign of power to not say sorry. But the inverse is true. At some point I realised that a good apology, confidently delivered, was like having a superpower. Even something short like \u201cI got it wrong \u2013 I\u2019m sorry\u201d can be potent and calming. Or, if you want to go longer: \u201cI can see I\u2019ve upset you and I\u2019m very sorry. I made a mistake. It won\u2019t happen again. What can I do to make it a bit better for you? What do you need?\u201d Notice the use of the \u201cI\u201d word, and \u201cyou\u201d only in terms of needs. It isn\u2019t an apology if you shift the blame. One of my favourite apologies of all time was given by former MP Louise Mensch in 2011. She not only owned her behaviour and apologised , but killed any further discussion stone dead. She\u2019d had an email from an investigative journalist accusing her of taking drugs, being drunk and dancing with a famous violinist, all \u201cin front of journalists\u201d.

Some of the good things that come from a sincere apology:\n- Apologizing establishes relationship rules : When you've broken a rule of social conduct\u2014from cutting in line to breaking the law\u2014re-establishes that you know what the \"rules\" are and agree that they should be upheld. This makes others feel safe knowing you agree that hurtful behavior isn't OK.\n- Apologizing re-establish dignity for those you hurt : Letting the injured party know that you know it was your fault, not theirs, helps them feel better, and it helps them save face.\n- Apologizing helps repair relationships : By getting people talking again, an apology makes them feel comfortable with each other again. It also helps convey the value that you place on the relationship. 1\n- Apologizing mends trust : A sincere apology allows you to let people know you're not proud of what you did, and won't be repeating the behavior. 2 That lets people know you're the kind of person who is generally careful not to hurt others and focuses on your better virtues, rather than on your worst mistakes.\nRelationships can be great sources of stress relief , but conflict can cause considerable stress , which takes a toll. Learning the art of apologizing effectively can significantly reduce the negative effects of conflict and relationship stress. Apologies help us put the conflict behind us and move on more easily.\nMany benefits come from forgiveness in terms of happiness and stress relief. 3 Being adept at apologizing when appropriate can strengthen relationships, reduce conflict, and bring forgiveness. It can be hard, but it's well worth the effort.\nHosted by Editor-in-Chief and therapist Amy Morin, LCSW, this episode of The Verywell Mind Podcast shares why it's OK to give second chances, featuring Purple Heart recipient Craig Rossi and Fred.\nApologizing can be difficult for a variety of reasons.

You just have to know when and how to deliver your apology.\nIf something you've done has caused pain for another person, it's a good idea to apologize, even if whatever you did was unintentional. This is because apologizing opens up the doors to communication, which allows you to reconnect with the person who was hurt.\nReasons you should consider apologizing include when:\n- You hurt or insulted someone\n- You behaved in a disrespectful way\n- You judged someone too harshly or unfairly\n- You engaged in behavior you knew was wrong, unfair, or hurtful\n- You failed to keep a promise\nIt also allows you to express regret that they have been hurt, which lets them know you care about their feelings.

If you care about the other person and the relationship, and you can avoid offending behavior in the future, an apology is usually a good idea.\nIt is important to note that apologies that involve empty promises are a bad idea. One of the important functions of an apology is that it affords the opportunity to re-establish trust; resolving not to repeat the offending behavior\u2014or to make whatever change is possible\u2014is an important part of an apology.\nIf you promise to change but then don't, the apology merely calls attention to the fact that you've done something even you agree is wrong, but refuse to change. 5\nDon't make promises you can't keep, but do try to make reasonable promises to avoid hurting the person in the future, and the follow through on those promises. If the other person is expecting something unreasonable or impossible, perhaps you're taking responsibility for more than you need to.\nAn insincere apology can often do more damage than no apology at all. When you are apologizing, it is important to include a few key ingredients so you can apologize sincerely . 5 They should help you to maintain healthy, happy relationships with your friends, family and loved ones.\nApologizing doesn't mean you need to take responsibility for things that were not your fault. You can express regret at unintentionally hurting someone's feelings, but you don't have to say you \"should have known better\" if you truly feel there is no way you could have known your actions would hurt them. In this situation, creating a new rule can help.\n\"I'm sorry I woke you! Now that I know you don't want people to call you after 8 p.m., I will be careful not to do so.\"\nTaking responsibility also means specifying what you did that you believe was wrong, but can entail gently mentioning what you believe was not wrong on your part.

Some of the good things that come from a sincere apology: Apologizing establishes relationship rules : When you've broken a rule of social conduct\u2014from cutting in line to breaking the law\u2014re-establishes that you know what the \"rules\" are and agree that they should be upheld. This makes others feel safe knowing you agree that hurtful behavior isn't OK. Apologizing re-establish dignity for those you hurt : Letting the injured party know that you know it was your fault, not theirs, helps them feel better, and it helps them save face. Apologizing helps repair relationships : By getting people talking again, an apology makes them feel comfortable with each other again. It also helps convey the value that you place on the relationship. 1 Apologizing mends trust : A sincere apology allows you to let people know you're not proud of what you did, and won't be repeating the behavior. 2 That lets people know you're the kind of person who is generally careful not to hurt others and focuses on your better virtues, rather than on your worst mistakes.  Relationships can be great sources of  stress relief  , but  conflict can cause considerable stress  , which takes a toll. Learning the art of apologizing effectively can significantly reduce the negative effects of conflict and relationship stress. Apologies help us put the conflict behind us and move on more easily.   Many benefits come  from forgiveness  in terms of  happiness  and stress relief.  3  Being adept at apologizing when appropriate can strengthen relationships, reduce conflict, and bring forgiveness. It can be hard, but it's well worth the effort.  Hosted by Editor-in-Chief and therapist Amy Morin, LCSW, this episode of The Verywell Mind Podcast shares why it's OK to give second chances, featuring Purple Heart recipient Craig Rossi and Fred. Apologizing can be difficult for a variety of reasons. How people interpret the need for an apology can play a significant role: Apologizing can create feelings of inadequacy : For some people, an apology often feels like an admission that they are inadequate\u2014that, rather than having made a mistake, there is something inherently wrong with them. Apologizing may imply guilt : Others believe that offering the first apology after an argument is an admission of guilt and responsibility for the entirety of a conflict that involved wrongs on the part of both parties; they think an apology from them will allow the other person to take no responsibility for their own part in the conflict. 4 Sometimes an apology seems to call attention to a mistake that may have gone unnoticed. However, in the right circumstances, a well-delivered, appropriately sincere apology will generally avoid all of these issues, and will merely serve to usher in a resolution, reaffirm shared values, and restore positive feelings. You just have to know when and how to deliver your apology. If something you've done has caused pain for another person, it's a good idea to apologize, even if whatever you did was unintentional. This is because apologizing opens up the doors to communication, which allows you to reconnect with the person who was hurt. Reasons you should consider apologizing include when: You hurt or insulted someone You behaved in a disrespectful way You judged someone too harshly or unfairly You engaged in behavior you knew was wrong, unfair, or hurtful You failed to keep a promise It also allows you to express regret that they have been hurt, which lets them know you care about their feelings. This can help them feel safer with you again. Apologizing also allows you to discuss what the \"rules\" should be in the future, especially if a new one needs to be made, which is often the case when you didn't hurt the other person intentionally.  Creating new rules for the relationship can help you be protected from getting hurt in the future. If you care about the other person and the relationship, and you can avoid offending behavior in the future, an apology is usually a good idea.  It is important to note that apologies that involve empty promises are a bad idea. One of the important functions of an apology is that it affords the opportunity to re-establish trust; resolving not to repeat the offending behavior\u2014or to make whatever change is possible\u2014is an important part of an apology. If you promise to change but then don't, the apology merely calls attention to the fact that you've done something even you agree is wrong, but refuse to change. 5 Don't make promises you can't keep, but do try to make reasonable promises to avoid hurting the person in the future, and the follow through on those promises. If the other person is expecting something unreasonable or impossible, perhaps you're taking responsibility for more than you need to. An insincere apology can often do more damage than no apology at all. When you are apologizing, it is important to include a few key ingredients so you can apologize sincerely . 5 They should help you to maintain healthy, happy relationships with your friends, family and loved ones.  Apologizing doesn't mean you need to take responsibility for things that were not your fault. You can express regret at unintentionally hurting someone's feelings, but you don't have to say you \"should have known better\" if you truly feel there is no way you could have known your actions would hurt them. In this situation, creating a new rule can help.  \"I'm sorry I woke you! Now that I know you don't want people to call you after 8 p.m., I will be careful not to do so.\" Taking responsibility also means specifying what you did that you believe was wrong, but can entail gently mentioning what you believe was not wrong on your part. In this way, you protect yourself from the feeling that if you are the first to apologize, you are taking responsibility for the whole conflict or for the bulk of it. Don't make excuses or try to qualify your apology. Instead, just say, \"I'm sorry.\" Avoid turning the apology into an opportunity to criticize or continue an argument. An apology can include a simple statement such as \"I am sorry that you felt that way.\" An apology does not necessarily involve stating that you did something wrong. Instead, it may be an acknowledgment that you hurt another person. Sometimes when you don't see eye to eye with another individual, an apology will turn into another argument. (\"I am sorry but ....\"). You can avoid this kind of circular argument by acknowledging someone else's feelings and that you hurt them. Apologies are not always easy , but saying your sorry can be important for healthy interpersonal relationships. If you've hurt someone, whether unintentionally or intentionally, consider how apologizing might help mend the pain and help you both move forward.", "documentFile": "https://www.verywellmind.com/the-importance-of-apologizing-3144986"}], "set_of_highlights_in_context": [{"source_supports_statement": "complete_support", "docSentText": "A meaningful apology communicates the three R's: regret, responsibility and remedy.", "docSpanText": "A meaningful apology communicates the three R's: regret, responsibility and remedy.", "docSentCharIdx": 7193.0, "problematic_instance": "no", "is_split": "no", "docSpanOffsets": [[7193, 7276]], "sent_idx": 71.0, "scuSentence": "Apologies can be meaningful when they communicate regret, responsibility and a remedy for the hurt or damage caused.", "scuSentCharIdx": 0, "documentFile": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/200207/the-power-apology#:~:text=A%20meaningful%20apology%20communicates%20the%20three%20R%27s%3A%20regret%2C,this%20person.%20This%20regret%20needs%20to%20be%20communicated.", "statement_supported": "Yes", "prefix": ""}, {"source_supports_statement": "partial_support", "docSentText": "You can express regret at unintentionally hurting someone's feelings, but you don't have to say you \"should have known better\" if you truly feel there is no way you could have known your actions would hurt them.", "docSpanText": "You can express regret at unintentionally hurting someone's feelings,", "docSentCharIdx": 6105.0, "problematic_instance": "no", "is_split": "no", "docSpanOffsets": [[6105, 6174]], "sent_idx": 45.0, "scuSentence": "Apologies can be meaningful when they communicate regret, responsibility and a remedy for the hurt or damage caused.", "scuSentCharIdx": 0, "documentFile": "https://www.verywellmind.com/the-importance-of-apologizing-3144986", "statement_supported": "Yes", "prefix": ""}, {"source_supports_statement": "complete_support", "docSentText": "\u201cIt should be a way to reconnect [with the person you\u2019ve wronged].", "docSpanText": "\u201cIt should be a way to reconnect [with the person you\u2019ve wronged].", "docSentCharIdx": 2781.0, "problematic_instance": "no", "is_split": "no", "docSpanOffsets": [[2781, 2847]], "sent_idx": 32.0, "scuSentence": "An apology should be a way to reconnect with the person who was wronged.", "scuSentCharIdx": 117, "documentFile": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/11/an-apology-has-to-be-meaningful-how-to-say-sorry-and-how-not-to", "statement_supported": "Yes", "prefix": "Apologies can be meaningful when they communicate regret, responsibility and a remedy for the hurt or damage caused.

Originally a treaty, ' Geneva Convention of Road Traffic' was signed, this treaty says that all traffic going in one direction should travel on the same side of the road.

Hope this helps Answer #3 In general cars in Europe have the driver's seat on the left side and drive on the right. Most of the world drives on the right side of the road while UK, Australia, India, South Africa, Japan and a handful of other countries drive on the left. The story behind this is that originally all drivers drove on the left side of the road going all the way back to Roman chariots. Over time most places have changed to driving on the right side of the road though there are still several places in the world that haven't. Answer #4 because there aredifferent cars in diffewrent countries. i guess some, somewhere thought it would be easier to drive with the drivers seat on the right side of the car. Answer #5 Cars from Europe the ones with the driver seat on the right, while the North American cars are made with the driver's seat built in on the left side. Answer #6 It would look silly putting a half-bench seat (you can't fit a full one, after all) beside the driver's seat, don't you think? Answer #7 Because oppsite side of traffic drives off to the left in places that have drivers on the right? That's my take on it. Answer #8 so the driver gets hit instead of the passanger and is more responsible for his or her driveing Answer #9 Continental European cars are just like north American cars.

Sometimes, it can be tough to know what to say in order to calm her down and make things okay again.

These tips will help you avoid making things worse and hopefully repair the relationship before it\u2019s too late. Saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d is always a good place to start. It may not seem like a big deal, but it is. And not just a perfunctory \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d\u2014actually take the time to reflect on what you did wrong and communicate that to your partner. Not only will this make her feel heard and understood, but it\u2019ll also help you understand where you went wrong so you can avoid making the same mistake again. Plus, it shows that you care about her feelings and want to work on your relationship together. Whether or not she accepts your apology as soon as you say it, what matters is that you did. It may not fix everything, but it\u2019s a good way to show that you\u2019re willing to take responsibility for your mistakes. If you\u2019re wondering what to do when your girlfriend is upset, then the first step is to take responsibility for your own actions. Admitting that you\u2019re wrong about the misunderstanding can be tough, but it\u2019s an important step in repairing your relationship. Plus, it\u2019ll show your girlfriend that you\u2019re taking ownership of your actions and serious about making things better. When you admit you\u2019re at fault, you allow your girlfriend to see that you\u2019re human and that you make mistakes just like everyone else. This can help her forgive you more easily and move on from the situation. Moreover, this will also make your girlfriend feel more inclined to listen to you and see things from your perspective. Whatever the reason is, charge it to experience. This will help you avoid the same mistakes in the future. If your girlfriend is annoyed with you, one way to defuse the situation is by changing your behavior. Defusing a situation is when you take action to calm a person or group down. This can be done in a number of ways, such as by speaking slowly and calmly, using reassuring language, or physically separating the people involved. It\u2019s important to remember that defusing a situation isn\u2019t the same as addressing and solving the issues. It\u2019s simply about creating emotional safety to ensure both of you aren\u2019t in any danger of harming each other. In other words, don\u2019t just say sorry\u2014show her through your actions that you\u2019re serious about making things right. And remember: She may want to communicate when she yells at you or is mad at you. According to the Considered Man , a girlfriend yelling at you is sometimes a way for a woman to communicate her feelings. \u201cIf your girlfriend is yelling at you to get your attention and make you see her, then she probably just needs you to see her at that moment, and she wants you to know how she feels about something.\u201d Humor is an essential part of any relationship. When things get tough, throwing in a few jokes is a good idea to help lighten the mood and calm your girlfriend down. Using humor to diffuse an angry girlfriend will not only show her that you\u2019re trying to make things better, but it\u2019ll also help her laugh off the situation and move on. Think of funny things to say when your girlfriend is mad. Maybe use text messages and emojis to communicate. The thing is, angry situations are emotionally charged . And when your girlfriend\u2019s upset, voicing your opinion about the matters at hand can only make matters worse. Just be careful not to go too far with your quirks and jokes\u2014you don\u2019t want to make her feel uncomfortable or like you\u2019re trying to downplay what\u2019s going on. Show that you\u2019re taking her seriously and trying to understand where she is coming from. Keep in mind the goal of calming her down and talking, not distracting her. Having a temper tantrum is a normal, healthy way for kids to express their anger. The same goes for your girlfriend\u2014 she might need some time to vent out her anger before she\u2019s ready to talk things through. You see, venting is a way of expressing frustration and anger to others. And letting someone vent is a way to help them get that frustration out. Hurtful things about your relationship problems are often said during this kind of tantrum, and it would be best if you just let her get it all out. Don\u2019t take anything she says during a tantrum personally. Just let her know that you\u2019re there for her and that you\u2019re willing to talk things through when she\u2019s ready. You\u2019ll be glad to know that tantrums usually don\u2019t last very long. The solution is to just wait it out and be there for her when she\u2019s ready to talk. Just sticking to listening and not trying to fix anything can make her feel better. Did your girlfriend get mad because you cancelled plans with her because of work? Has she been giving you the cold shoulder because you blew her off for a night out with your friends? There could be millions of reasons why your girlfriend is mad at you, but the most important thing is to acknowledge her feelings. Don\u2019t try to downplay what she\u2019s feeling or make excuses for your behavior. Just let her know that you hear her and understand why she\u2019s upset. This will show her that you respect how she feels , which can help diffuse the situation. Plus, it\u2019ll give you a chance to start repairing whatever damage that\u2019s been done. Conflicts are challenging in themselves, but they\u2019re even harder when only one person is acknowledging that there\u2019s a problem. So next time, try to make things easier on both of you by being the first to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was wrong.\u201d It\u2019s one thing to apologize when your girlfriend\u2019s mad at you, it\u2019s another to show her you\u2019re sorry. When a woman gets mad at you, she feels all sorts of emotions aside from anger. If you\u2019re thinking of what to text your girlfriend when she\u2019s sad and angry, why not send love quotes when she\u2019s upset? These quotes are a caring way to convince your angry girlfriend that you\u2019re truly sorry for what you did wrong. Peace offerings are always a good way to make amends. And if you\u2019re thinking of what to buy your girlfriend when she\u2019s mad at you, an easy win would be flowers. Flowers have a way of making people feel better, and your girlfriend is likely no different. So go ahead and buy her some flowers the next time she\u2019s mad at you. You can also take her out on a dinner date. It\u2019s always a good thing to add a little romance with an intimate dinner for two. And if you want to make things extra special, write her a heartfelt apology letter. Pour your heart out and talk about your feelings of love for her. She\u2019ll definitely appreciate your efforts, and it might just help smooth things over between the two of you. It\u2019s not that you want to distract her from being mad, but complimenting your girlfriend could go a long way. Tell her how beautiful she looks when she\u2019s angry, and that you still find her attractive even though she\u2019s mad. Remember, framing of words and timing is critical when your girlfriend is angry. Doing it at the wrong moment could make things worse. But if you compliment her with the right words at the right time , it could show that you really do care about her and want to make things better between the two of you. It would be easy to just fight back and get into a big argument with your girlfriend. Besides, your girlfriend gets mad at everything anyway, right? Here\u2019s a piece of advice: even if your girlfriend\u2019s always mad, snapping back at her when she\u2019s angry is only going to make things worse. If you want to respond to her, do it in a way that\u2019ll be constructive and will actually lead to a productive conversation. Instead of getting defensive, try to listen to what she has to say and see if there\u2019s any truth to her anger. It\u2019s possible that your girlfriend is actually mad about something else entirely and she\u2019s taking it out on you. If you can manage to stay calm and listen to your girlfriend\u2019s point of view, you\u2019ll be able to de-escalate the situation pretty quickly. But if you don\u2019t have anything nice to say, it would be best to keep quiet. You have the ability to hold your tongue and think about what you want to say before you blurt out something that you\u2019ll only regret. If your girlfriend seems to always get annoyed and angry over everything, consider giving her some space. Let her know that both of you need some time to cool off and you\u2019ll talk to her when things have settled down. This will give both of you a chance to calm down and think about what may have led to the argument in the first place. Remember, space is good not just for her own mental health, but also for yours. When you\u2019re in the middle of an argument, it can be difficult to think clearly and make rational decisions. Out of respect, give her the silent treatment by holding off the phone calls and social media reactions for a while. More important than that, be available when she\u2019s ready to talk. This will show her that you\u2019re taking the argument seriously and that you still want to work things out. Having an angry girlfriend can be really daunting, especially if you don\u2019t know how to respond correctly. The key is to remember that her anger isn\u2019t always directed at you. Sometimes things happen in life that can cause her emotions to flare up, and she takes it out on the people she loves the most. Even if your girlfriend makes you angry because of this, or even when she\u2019s mad at you for no reason, you\u2019d still want to express your love for her. Remind yourself that she\u2019s angry, not you. If you don\u2019t know what to say to make up with your girlfriend to make her feel loved and appreciated, just listen to her. She\u2019ll feel better if she can get everything off her chest. Aside from buying her gifts and setting romantic night-outs together, it isn\u2019t a bad thing to define your relationship by resorting to makeup sex . To be honest, it can make her feel wanted and appreciated, especially if she knows that you still love her despite her anger. The best thing about this is that it helps relieve some of the tension and hopefully end the fight altogether. Just try not to go too overboard with this one \u2013 save the sex for when things have truly been smoothed over. You don\u2019t want your girlfriend to think that you\u2019re only interested in her body and not her feelings. If things don\u2019t work out after trying everything, you might want to consider seeking help from a relationship expert. They can help you get to the root of the problem and find long-term solutions. Have you ever asked yourself why love is so hard? When you\u2019re dealing with an angry girlfriend, it\u2019s easy to become frustrated and even feel helpless. You may even be tempted to throw in the towel and give up on love. I want to suggest doing something different. It\u2019s something I learned from the world-renowned shaman Rud\u00e1 Iand\u00ea. He taught me and my partner that the way to find love and intimacy isn\u2019t what we\u2019ve been culturally conditioned to believe. In fact, many of us self-sabotage and trick ourselves for years, getting in the way of meeting a partner who can truly fulfill us. As Rud\u00e1 explains in this mind-blowing free video , many of us chase love in a toxic way that ends up stabbing us in the back. We get stuck in awful relationships or empty encounters, never really finding what we\u2019re looking for, and continuing to feel horrible about things like the issue of responding to your angry girlfriend. We fall in love with an ideal version of someone instead of the real person. We try to \u201cfix\u201d our partners and end up destroying relationships. We try to find someone who \u201ccompletes\u201d us, only to fall apart with them next to us and feel twice as bad. Rud\u00e1\u2019s teachings show a whole new perspective. While watching, I felt like someone understood my struggles to find and nurture love for the first time \u2013 and finally offered an actual, practical solution on how my partner responded to me when I\u2019m upset. If you\u2019re done with unsatisfying dating , empty hookups, frustrating relationships, and having your hopes dashed over and over, then this is a message you need to hear. I guarantee you will not be disappointed. If you\u2019re wondering what words to tell your girlfriend and calm her down when she\u2019s mad at you, look no further.

This article was originally published in May 2016.\nHave you ever had someone come to you crying?\nMaybe your wife had a brutal day at work and fell apart when she came through the door.\nOr your mom lost it while reminiscing about your deceased dad.\nOr your usually stoic buddy broke down about his girlfriend dumping him.\nInteracting with someone who\u2019s sad and hurting can be awkward; you want to be there for them, show your empathy, and strengthen your relationship, but it\u2019s hard to know how to act and what to say. A lot of us end up sitting there uncomfortably, offering some awkward back pats, while saying, \u201cThere, there, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\nI know a lot of guys out there struggle with this scenario, because I\u2019ve gotten more requests to cover this topic than any other.\nI held off on doing so, because while I thought I did a pretty good job in this area myself, I wanted to see if there was real research out there concerning best practices. Fortunately, I recently came across some great tips from Dr. John Gottman , a professor of psychology and arguably the foremost relationship expert in the country. Today I\u2019ll share his advice, as well as the tips I\u2019ve gleaned from personal experience, on how to comfort someone who\u2019s sad, so you can help them in their time of need and be a better son, friend, and husband/boyfriend.\n\u201cWitness\u201d their feelings. One of the most difficult things about trying to comfort someone who\u2019s hurting is feeling like you don\u2019t know what to say. Fortunately, most of the time people aren\u2019t actually looking for you to offer specific advice or pearls of wisdom; the most comforting thing in the world isn\u2019t an inspiring platitude, but feeling like someone else gets what you\u2019re going through, and that you\u2019re not alone in the world. The thing people want most when they\u2019re hurting is for you to act as a sounding board and to show understanding and empathy. Gottman calls this \u201cwitnessing\u201d your loved one\u2019s distress.\nSo to start off comforting someone, simply describe what you\u2019re seeing/sensing. Say something like, \u201cI know you\u2019re having such a hard time with this,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re hurting so much.\u201d\nAlso affirm that you hear what they\u2019re saying by saying it back to them in your own words.\nSo if your wife, who\u2019s in tears, says:\n\u201cMy boss told me I wasn\u2019t cut out for my job, and that if I make one more mistake he\u2019s going to fire me.\u201d\nYou would say back:\n\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re upset because you haven\u2019t been doing as well as you\u2019d like at work, and you\u2019re worried that you\u2019re going to lose your job. Is that right?\u201d\nAffirm that their feelings make sense. You want to not only acknowledge that you hear the person\u2019s feelings, but that they make sense to you. It\u2019s lonely to feel like you\u2019re coming at something from out of left field.\nSo you might say to your friend who\u2019s going through a bad break-up: \u201cOf course you\u2019re devastated. I honestly was depressed for months after Emily and I ended things.\u201d\nKeep in mind that while sharing your similar experiences shows empathy, you want to be careful not to pivot the focus of the conversation onto you . Don\u2019t try to one-up the person by sharing a story of how you\u2019ve had it worse, and don\u2019t go on and on about your own experience. Instead, briefly share how you\u2019ve been through something similar, and then return the focus to the other person by asking them questions and eliciting more details (see the next point). Even if you haven\u2019t experienced the same thing, you can still say, \u201cThat\u2019s never happened to me, but I can really get why you\u2019re feeling that way.\u201d\nIf the person\u2019s feelings don\u2019t make sense to you, that makes the next step all the more important.\nShow the person you understand their feelings, and facilitate the deepening of his or her own understanding of them. Sometimes people do want advice or a proposed solution to their problem, but even then, they usually first simply want to vent their feelings; as has often been observed, this is especially true of women. So hold off on going into problem-solving mode at first, and just listen. See your job not as talking, but as getting the other person to talk, so that they can sort through their feelings themselves; they may not even be able to articulate why they\u2019re feeling down, unless you draw it out of them.\nIn getting your friend/partner/relative to open up, you demonstrate your genuine support and interest, enhance your understanding of their suffering, and let them know that you know why they\u2019re sad; as the philosopher Soren Kierkegaard ( he the advocate for indirect communication ) advises, that last part is important even if you think you already understand, and already know how to solve their problem:\n\u201cIf real success is to attend the effort to bring another person to a definite position, one must first of all take the pains to find that person where he or she is and begin there. This is the secret of the art of helping others. Anyone who has not mastered this is himself deluded when he proposes to help others. In order to help another effectively, I must understand more than he \u2014 yet first of all surely I must understand what he understands. If I do not know that, my greater understanding will be of no help to him. If, however, I am disposed to plume myself on my greater understanding, it is because I am vain or proud, so that at the bottom, instead of benefiting him, I want to be admired . . . To help does not mean to be a sovereign but a servant . . . not to be ambitious but to be patient.\u201d\nOr as the minister Fred B. Craddock puts it so well:\n\u201c To understand what is understood and how it is understood means not only that you understand but that the listener understands that you do .\u201d\nTo facilitate this drawing out process, Gottman recommends using \u201cexploratory statements and open-ended questions\u201d like:\n- Tell me what happened.\n- Tell me everything that\u2019s bothering/worrying you.\n- Tell me all of your concerns.\n- Tell me everything that\u2019s led up to this.\n- Help me understand more about what you\u2019re feeling.\n- What set off these feelings?\n- What\u2019s the thing that\u2019s worrying you the most?\n- What\u2019s the worst that could happen? (If you feel like someone is catastrophizing \u2014 believing something is much worse than it is \u2014 try working through this exercise with them )\nGottman recommends against asking any \u201cwhy\u201d questions since, no matter how well-intended, they tend to come off as criticism:\n\u201cWhen you ask, \u2018Why do you think like that?\u2019 the other person is likely to hear, \u2018Stop thinking that, you\u2019re wrong!\u2019 A more successful approach would be, \u2018What leads you to think that?\u2019 or, \u2018Help me understand how you decided that.\u2019\u201d\nBy working through these exploratory statements and questions, you\u2019ll hopefully not only get a better understanding of the person\u2019s suffering, but help them come to understand it better themselves too. They may come up with their own solution, realize that things really aren\u2019t so bad, or simply feel better having gotten their worries or grief off their chest.\nDon\u2019t minimize their pain or try to cheer them up. When faced with tears, it\u2019s natural to want to try to snap the person out of it with smiles and jokes, or by insisting that whatever they\u2019re upset about is \u201cno big deal.\u201d But someone who\u2019s upset wants to take you on a tour of their melancholic landscape, pointing out the blue-tinged landmarks they\u2019re seeing; it doesn\u2019t help to say, \u201cNope, there\u2019s nothing out there!\u201d or \u201cLook, there\u2019s a dog riding a unicycle!\u201d Something may not feel like a big deal to you, but it does feel like a big deal to them. Don\u2019t trivialize their experience, but walk through it with them.\nBut what if someone\u2019s reason for feeling sad really is no big deal? If you don\u2019t think their deprecating feelings about an event, or themselves, are justified, ask, \u201cCan you think of any evidence that\u2019s contrary to the conclusion you\u2019ve reached?\u201d If they can\u2019t, ask if you can suggest your own and share an alternative way of seeing things (it\u2019s nice to ask permission here, because offering a contrarian view, unsolicited, tends to come off as critical and antagonistic).\nIf someone\u2019s feelings are habitually irrational and grossly disproportionate to their cause, or they\u2019re constant complainers who get upset about everything, that\u2019s probably someone you simply want to minimize contact with if possible.\nOffer physical affection if appropriate. Sometimes people don\u2019t want to talk, and don\u2019t want you to talk either \u2014 they just want to be held in silence. But one of the things I think guys struggle with when trying to comfort someone is knowing how much physical affection to offer. The gestures you make should generally match whatever you give the person on a normal basis. If you\u2019ve never hugged the person you\u2019re comforting, then don\u2019t go beyond putting a hand on their shoulder, or an arm around it. If they\u2019re someone you hug regularly, then give them an embrace. If you\u2019re intimate partners, offer a snuggle.\nNow this just goes for gestures you initiate; in gauging the level of needed physical affection, you should really let the other person take the lead \u2014 they may lean in to that arm you drape over their shoulder, and if they do, you should reciprocate.\nJust be careful about the messages you send; if a girl is crying because you\u2019re breaking up with her, or she just confessed feelings that aren\u2019t requited, physical affection could send a mixed message. Also, if you make your affection towards your significant other too sensual, rather than comforting, they could be offended that you\u2019re trying to make a play for sex, when they\u2019re trying to work through a tough issue.\nSuggest action steps. As mentioned above, there are times when people just want to be heard and comforted, and don\u2019t want a solution to their feelings of sadness (often there is no solution; you can\u2019t bring your dead dad back \u2014 grief is just grief). In such cases, after going through the above steps, the person typically feels better for having shared the burden on their heart, and the sadness runs its course. Ask if there\u2019s anything else they want to tell you. If it\u2019s nighttime, when these feelings tend to come out, suggest they go to bed; everyone feels better in the morning.\nOther times, the upset person still feels unresolved, and wants advice on what to do. First, ask them if they have any ideas as to steps they could take to improve the situation \u2014 solutions are more likely to be adopted if the person comes up with them on their own. If they\u2019ve got big, macro ideas, help break those down into next-action steps. If they\u2019re at a loss as to how to proceed, offer your suggestions.\nWith someone who\u2019s sad not because of an isolated event, but because they suffer from depression , pivot as quickly as possible to talking about an action step, or just inviting them to do something else besides talking \u2014 e.g., take a walk or go for a drive together. Excess rumination is not only ineffective in alleviating depressed feelings, it can actually make them worse.\nAffirm your support and commitment.

But one of the things I think guys struggle with when trying to comfort someone is knowing how much physical affection to offer. The gestures you make should generally match whatever you give the person on a normal basis. If you\u2019ve never hugged the person you\u2019re comforting, then don\u2019t go beyond putting a hand on their shoulder, or an arm around it. If they\u2019re someone you hug regularly, then give them an embrace. If you\u2019re intimate partners, offer a snuggle. Now this just goes for gestures you initiate; in gauging the level of needed physical affection, you should really let the other person take the lead \u2014 they may lean in to that arm you drape over their shoulder, and if they do, you should reciprocate. Just be careful about the messages you send; if a girl is crying because you\u2019re breaking up with her, or she just confessed feelings that aren\u2019t requited, physical affection could send a mixed message. Also, if you make your affection towards your significant other too sensual, rather than comforting, they could be offended that you\u2019re trying to make a play for sex, when they\u2019re trying to work through a tough issue. Suggest action steps. As mentioned above, there are times when people just want to be heard and comforted, and don\u2019t want a solution to their feelings of sadness (often there is no solution; you can\u2019t bring your dead dad back \u2014 grief is just grief). In such cases, after going through the above steps, the person typically feels better for having shared the burden on their heart, and the sadness runs its course. Ask if there\u2019s anything else they want to tell you. If it\u2019s nighttime, when these feelings tend to come out, suggest they go to bed; everyone feels better in the morning. Other times, the upset person still feels unresolved, and wants advice on what to do. First, ask them if they have any ideas as to steps they could take to improve the situation \u2014 solutions are more likely to be adopted if the person comes up with them on their own. If they\u2019ve got big, macro ideas, help break those down into next-action steps. If they\u2019re at a loss as to how to proceed, offer your suggestions. With someone who\u2019s sad not because of an isolated event, but because they suffer from depression , pivot as quickly as possible to talking about an action step, or just inviting them to do something else besides talking \u2014 e.g., take a walk or go for a drive together. Excess rumination is not only ineffective in alleviating depressed feelings, it can actually make them worse. Affirm your support and commitment. As a comfort-driven conversation winds down, let the person know that you understand what they\u2019re going through, that you\u2019re sorry they\u2019re going through it, and that your shoulder is always available for crying on.", "documentFile": "https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/social-skills/how-to-comfort-someone-whos-sad-crying/"}, {"source_title": "How to Comfort Your Girlfriend when She Is Upset: 12 Steps", "source_content_title": null, "source_date": null, "source_author": null, "documentText": ["When your girlfriend is upset, there are two parts to comforting her.", "She will need to feel emotional support through the things you say.", "Also, she will need to feel secured through the physical support that you give her.", "If you combine these correctly, she\u2019ll feel better in no time.", "\nPart\n1\n- 1Ask her what\u2019s wrong.", "No matter what your opinion is, keep it to yourself.", "Let her vent and get the story out, just nodding and adding a small comment when necessary.", "If she doesn\u2019t want to tell you, don\u2019t pressure her.", "Some girls don\u2019t like to talk about why they\u2019re so upset.", "If this is the case, just tell her that you care and let her cry it out.", "[1]\n- 2Be supportive , not dismissive.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if you don't agree with her issues.", "Reassure her that you\u2019re there for her.", "Take her to a private spot and tell her that it", "\u2019s alright to cry .", "Ensure her that you\u2019re on her side.", "\n- \"I know that this must feel terrible right now.", "I'm so sorry.", "\"\n- \"I can't imagine how you feel.", "I know this can't be easy.", "\"\n- \"I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re upset.", "Please let me know if I can do anything to make it better.", "\u201d\n- 3Acknowledge the issue and briefly express your feelings .", "Just showing someone that you see and understand their problem means the world.", "Keep it short and simple.\n- \"I am so sad to hear that your mom is sick.", "\"\n- \"I know you really deserved that promotion.", "I'm sorry it didn't work out.", "\"\n- \"She was a great friend, and I'm upset she's moving away too.\"", "[3]\n- 4Stay away from giving advice.", "Most people are upset because there is no easy solution.", "So don't try to offer her one.", "She's more than likely thought it all out before, and your advice will just keep her circling around how \"hopeless\" her problems are.", "Instead, say:\n- \"This must be really hard for you.", "\"\n- \"I wish I had an answer or solution.", "Just know that I'm here for you no matter what.", "\"\n- \"What do you think comes next?\"\n- \"How do you want to handle this?\"", "[4]\n- If you're the cause of the problem, do not try to explain yourself right now.", "Let her vent and open up first.", "[5]\n- 5Empathize and validate her emotions.", "This one can be hard, but as long as you let her take the lead you can help her get a hold of her feelings.", "Get her to open up about how she feels instead of the situation or the outcome by drawing on your personal experience.", "Labeling the feelings will help her control them:\n- \"I know you really wanted that job.", "I would be really let down in your shoes.", "\"\n- \"You absolutely have a right to be sad;

This article was originally published in May 2016.\nHave you ever had someone come to you crying?\nMaybe your wife had a brutal day at work and fell apart when she came through the door.\nOr your mom lost it while reminiscing about your deceased dad.\nOr your usually stoic buddy broke down about his girlfriend dumping him.\nInteracting with someone who\u2019s sad and hurting can be awkward; you want to be there for them, show your empathy, and strengthen your relationship, but it\u2019s hard to know how to act and what to say. A lot of us end up sitting there uncomfortably, offering some awkward back pats, while saying, \u201cThere, there, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\nI know a lot of guys out there struggle with this scenario, because I\u2019ve gotten more requests to cover this topic than any other.\nI held off on doing so, because while I thought I did a pretty good job in this area myself, I wanted to see if there was real research out there concerning best practices. Fortunately, I recently came across some great tips from Dr. John Gottman , a professor of psychology and arguably the foremost relationship expert in the country. Today I\u2019ll share his advice, as well as the tips I\u2019ve gleaned from personal experience, on how to comfort someone who\u2019s sad, so you can help them in their time of need and be a better son, friend, and husband/boyfriend.\n\u201cWitness\u201d their feelings. One of the most difficult things about trying to comfort someone who\u2019s hurting is feeling like you don\u2019t know what to say. Fortunately, most of the time people aren\u2019t actually looking for you to offer specific advice or pearls of wisdom; the most comforting thing in the world isn\u2019t an inspiring platitude, but feeling like someone else gets what you\u2019re going through, and that you\u2019re not alone in the world. The thing people want most when they\u2019re hurting is for you to act as a sounding board and to show understanding and empathy. Gottman calls this \u201cwitnessing\u201d your loved one\u2019s distress.\nSo to start off comforting someone, simply describe what you\u2019re seeing/sensing. Say something like, \u201cI know you\u2019re having such a hard time with this,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re hurting so much.\u201d\nAlso affirm that you hear what they\u2019re saying by saying it back to them in your own words.\nSo if your wife, who\u2019s in tears, says:\n\u201cMy boss told me I wasn\u2019t cut out for my job, and that if I make one more mistake he\u2019s going to fire me.\u201d\nYou would say back:\n\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re upset because you haven\u2019t been doing as well as you\u2019d like at work, and you\u2019re worried that you\u2019re going to lose your job. Is that right?\u201d\nAffirm that their feelings make sense. You want to not only acknowledge that you hear the person\u2019s feelings, but that they make sense to you. It\u2019s lonely to feel like you\u2019re coming at something from out of left field.\nSo you might say to your friend who\u2019s going through a bad break-up: \u201cOf course you\u2019re devastated. I honestly was depressed for months after Emily and I ended things.\u201d\nKeep in mind that while sharing your similar experiences shows empathy, you want to be careful not to pivot the focus of the conversation onto you . Don\u2019t try to one-up the person by sharing a story of how you\u2019ve had it worse, and don\u2019t go on and on about your own experience. Instead, briefly share how you\u2019ve been through something similar, and then return the focus to the other person by asking them questions and eliciting more details (see the next point). Even if you haven\u2019t experienced the same thing, you can still say, \u201cThat\u2019s never happened to me, but I can really get why you\u2019re feeling that way.\u201d\nIf the person\u2019s feelings don\u2019t make sense to you, that makes the next step all the more important.\nShow the person you understand their feelings, and facilitate the deepening of his or her own understanding of them. Sometimes people do want advice or a proposed solution to their problem, but even then, they usually first simply want to vent their feelings; as has often been observed, this is especially true of women. So hold off on going into problem-solving mode at first, and just listen. See your job not as talking, but as getting the other person to talk, so that they can sort through their feelings themselves; they may not even be able to articulate why they\u2019re feeling down, unless you draw it out of them.\nIn getting your friend/partner/relative to open up, you demonstrate your genuine support and interest, enhance your understanding of their suffering, and let them know that you know why they\u2019re sad; as the philosopher Soren Kierkegaard ( he the advocate for indirect communication ) advises, that last part is important even if you think you already understand, and already know how to solve their problem:\n\u201cIf real success is to attend the effort to bring another person to a definite position, one must first of all take the pains to find that person where he or she is and begin there. This is the secret of the art of helping others. Anyone who has not mastered this is himself deluded when he proposes to help others. In order to help another effectively, I must understand more than he \u2014 yet first of all surely I must understand what he understands. If I do not know that, my greater understanding will be of no help to him. If, however, I am disposed to plume myself on my greater understanding, it is because I am vain or proud, so that at the bottom, instead of benefiting him, I want to be admired . . . To help does not mean to be a sovereign but a servant . . . not to be ambitious but to be patient.\u201d\nOr as the minister Fred B. Craddock puts it so well:\n\u201c To understand what is understood and how it is understood means not only that you understand but that the listener understands that you do .\u201d\nTo facilitate this drawing out process, Gottman recommends using \u201cexploratory statements and open-ended questions\u201d like:\n- Tell me what happened.\n- Tell me everything that\u2019s bothering/worrying you.\n- Tell me all of your concerns.\n- Tell me everything that\u2019s led up to this.\n- Help me understand more about what you\u2019re feeling.\n- What set off these feelings?\n- What\u2019s the thing that\u2019s worrying you the most?\n- What\u2019s the worst that could happen? (If you feel like someone is catastrophizing \u2014 believing something is much worse than it is \u2014 try working through this exercise with them )\nGottman recommends against asking any \u201cwhy\u201d questions since, no matter how well-intended, they tend to come off as criticism:\n\u201cWhen you ask, \u2018Why do you think like that?\u2019 the other person is likely to hear, \u2018Stop thinking that, you\u2019re wrong!\u2019 A more successful approach would be, \u2018What leads you to think that?\u2019 or, \u2018Help me understand how you decided that.\u2019\u201d\nBy working through these exploratory statements and questions, you\u2019ll hopefully not only get a better understanding of the person\u2019s suffering, but help them come to understand it better themselves too. They may come up with their own solution, realize that things really aren\u2019t so bad, or simply feel better having gotten their worries or grief off their chest.\nDon\u2019t minimize their pain or try to cheer them up. When faced with tears, it\u2019s natural to want to try to snap the person out of it with smiles and jokes, or by insisting that whatever they\u2019re upset about is \u201cno big deal.\u201d But someone who\u2019s upset wants to take you on a tour of their melancholic landscape, pointing out the blue-tinged landmarks they\u2019re seeing; it doesn\u2019t help to say, \u201cNope, there\u2019s nothing out there!\u201d or \u201cLook, there\u2019s a dog riding a unicycle!\u201d Something may not feel like a big deal to you, but it does feel like a big deal to them. Don\u2019t trivialize their experience, but walk through it with them.\nBut what if someone\u2019s reason for feeling sad really is no big deal? If you don\u2019t think their deprecating feelings about an event, or themselves, are justified, ask, \u201cCan you think of any evidence that\u2019s contrary to the conclusion you\u2019ve reached?\u201d If they can\u2019t, ask if you can suggest your own and share an alternative way of seeing things (it\u2019s nice to ask permission here, because offering a contrarian view, unsolicited, tends to come off as critical and antagonistic).\nIf someone\u2019s feelings are habitually irrational and grossly disproportionate to their cause, or they\u2019re constant complainers who get upset about everything, that\u2019s probably someone you simply want to minimize contact with if possible.\nOffer physical affection if appropriate. Sometimes people don\u2019t want to talk, and don\u2019t want you to talk either \u2014 they just want to be held in silence. But one of the things I think guys struggle with when trying to comfort someone is knowing how much physical affection to offer. The gestures you make should generally match whatever you give the person on a normal basis. If you\u2019ve never hugged the person you\u2019re comforting, then don\u2019t go beyond putting a hand on their shoulder, or an arm around it. If they\u2019re someone you hug regularly, then give them an embrace. If you\u2019re intimate partners, offer a snuggle.\nNow this just goes for gestures you initiate; in gauging the level of needed physical affection, you should really let the other person take the lead \u2014 they may lean in to that arm you drape over their shoulder, and if they do, you should reciprocate.\nJust be careful about the messages you send; if a girl is crying because you\u2019re breaking up with her, or she just confessed feelings that aren\u2019t requited, physical affection could send a mixed message. Also, if you make your affection towards your significant other too sensual, rather than comforting, they could be offended that you\u2019re trying to make a play for sex, when they\u2019re trying to work through a tough issue.\nSuggest action steps. As mentioned above, there are times when people just want to be heard and comforted, and don\u2019t want a solution to their feelings of sadness (often there is no solution; you can\u2019t bring your dead dad back \u2014 grief is just grief). In such cases, after going through the above steps, the person typically feels better for having shared the burden on their heart, and the sadness runs its course. Ask if there\u2019s anything else they want to tell you. If it\u2019s nighttime, when these feelings tend to come out, suggest they go to bed; everyone feels better in the morning.\nOther times, the upset person still feels unresolved, and wants advice on what to do. First, ask them if they have any ideas as to steps they could take to improve the situation \u2014 solutions are more likely to be adopted if the person comes up with them on their own. If they\u2019ve got big, macro ideas, help break those down into next-action steps. If they\u2019re at a loss as to how to proceed, offer your suggestions.\nWith someone who\u2019s sad not because of an isolated event, but because they suffer from depression , pivot as quickly as possible to talking about an action step, or just inviting them to do something else besides talking \u2014 e.g., take a walk or go for a drive together. Excess rumination is not only ineffective in alleviating depressed feelings, it can actually make them worse.\nAffirm your support and commitment. As a comfort-driven conversation winds down, let the person know that you understand what they\u2019re going through, that you\u2019re sorry they\u2019re going through it, and that your shoulder is always available for crying on.", "source_raw_text": "With our archives now 3,500+ articles deep, we\u2019ve decided to republish a classic piece each Sunday to help our newer readers discover some of the best, evergreen gems from the past.

Stroud second overall, the Texans traded up nine slots, from 12 to three in the first round, to take Alabama defensive end Will Anderson . Houston GM Nick Caserio traded 12 and 34 this year and first- and third-round picks next year to just barely squeeze the trade into the NFL\u2019s 10-minute window for the third pick. As I explain in the next item about Arizona\u2019s draft, Houston could be picking very early next year\u2014which will put a white hot spotlight of pressure on Anderson.\nCaserio told me at NRG Stadium that Stroud was clearly the team\u2019s target at two. He\u2019d had some discussions with Cards GM Monti Ossenfort about possibly moving from 12 to three. \u201cThen,\u201d Caserio said, \u201cit happened pretty quickly when they were on the clock.\u201d\nThe deal got done and all parties notified, he said, with \u201cclose to a minute\u201d left. So the Texans got a player they hope will be their franchise QB, and they got the best defensive player on their board. That is one heck of a night\u2019s work. The price, of course, is denuding the 2024 draft when the Texans might wish they had two first-round picks and four in the first three rounds\u2014instead of now just one first-round pick, one second- and no thirds.\nBut \u2013 and there is a big but \u2013 you should have been at the Texans\u2019 facility in the basement of NRG Stadium late Friday afternoon, when Stroud and Anderson put on a show of humility and team-firstness that had to make Texans fans so weary of losing (a league-worst 11-38-1 in the last three years) happy for the first time since the Wild Card win over Buffalo three years ago.\nStroud and Anderson came with their families and made it clear they were all-in on going to a losing team after years of nothing but winning in college. Afterward, Stroud told me: \u201cThat\u2019s what life is about, working to build something good. That\u2019s what I\u2019m here to help this team do. I\u2019m ready for it.\u201d\nThe Texans have asked Stroud to let the S-2 Test controversy go, but he got a couple last licks in on it. A player who played the way Stroud did\u2014particularly in putting up 41 points in his superb final college game in the playoff against Georgia\u2014is not a player who can\u2019t process, or can\u2019t ID a defense. I understand using every tool in the bag to analyze players before the draft, and I\u2019d check out why Stroud scored low on the test. But to think it\u2019s a good indicator of future failure\u2014I mean, watch the games he\u2019s played.\nWe stood in a hallway just off the Texans\u2019 locker room for 12 minutes and I asked him about what he\u2019s learned from the last three months.\n\u201cHumility is something I\u2019m not afraid of,\u201d Stroud said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019m accustomed to. This was all probably just a humble moment God wanted me to go through.\n\u201c A lot of people haven\u2019t played the sport, and I mean critics are gonna critique. For me I know the film speaks for itself. Everything that I\u2019ve done in college, I\u2019ve been very consistent. I think I\u2019ve been one of the most consistent players in college football for the last two years. If you turn on the tape, you can see, you can answer the questions. But those who don\u2019t understand tape might want to go to other things and analyze other things. They\u2019re more than welcome to do such. But the people who are making the choices and the picks, they knew what I can do. They understood the IQ that I do have.\n\u201cI have a great memory when it comes to football,\u201d Stroud added. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s different ways to be geniuses. You don\u2019t just have to be book smart. You can be analytics smart. You can be numbers smart. You can be football smart. I really think that there\u2019s different types of ways to be smart. That\u2019s something that I pride myself on. And I am book smart. I did have over a 3.0 in college. I had over a 3.0 in high school. I know that I can think. I can process very, very fast. The film, you can see me going from first option to second and then back to one and then to three to four if I have to. I can check down. I can use my feet.\n\u201cBut, you know, everything happens for a reason. I\u2019m not upset. I\u2019m actually blessed, I\u2019m super blessed to be a Texan. Number two overall pick in the NFL draft, man. A little kid from the [California] Inland Empire. All smiles, man. I ain\u2019t tripping about this.\u201d\nGood attitude to have. But at the same time, I could feel it: C.J. Stroud will remember this pre-draft process. And for the Texans, that bit of motivation will be a very good thing.\nHENDERSON, Nev.\u2014Just before noon on Thursday, hours before the start of the NFL Draft, Raiders coach Josh McDaniels popped into GM Dave Ziegler \u2019s office for one last bit of strategy talk. The team\u2019s draft board had been set with finality Wednesday, after three months of debate. The Raiders, after conversations with teams above them about trading up from number seven in the first round, decided to stay in their slot, barring a surprise.\n\u201cWhat we need is for three quarterbacks to go before we pick,\u201d McDaniels said.\nIt seemed logical, with Carolina going Bryce Young at number one and then Houston at two and Indianapolis at four and Seattle at five all in the QB market. But nothing in this draft after Carolina was a sure thing. All McDaniels and Ziegler knew was that these four non-QBs sat at the top of their board a short spiral away, graded closely:\nBut as Ziegler and McDaniels hashed it out, and McDaniels talked about the latest intel he\u2019d heard about the top six (\u201cI hope I\u2019ll have something coming in on Houston at two, but Nick\u2019s tight,\u201d he said, referring to Texans GM/CIA agent Nick Caserio ), they realized they were just like the rest of America: They doubted Houston would pick a quarterback at two, they didn\u2019t know which GM was fixing to pay a ransom to trade up with Arizona at three, they didn\u2019t know which quarterback Indianapolis would choose at four, and they didn\u2019t know if Seattle would go QB or best defensive weapon at five.\nNo surprise, all this mystery. This is the modern draft, where lips are no longer loose, where mock drafts are a mockery of reality. It sounds counterintuitive, but in the hours before the NFL Draft, the people running drafts for $6 billion franchises didn\u2019t know much more than the rest of us. Ziegler and McDaniels did know by staying put\u2014and they would get a phone call that surprised and tempted them minutes before their pick\u2014they were not in control of their fate. They needed help. The Raiders needed two teams post-Carolina to pick passers in the next five picks. Likely. Not certain.\nAt 4:43 p.m. Pacific Time, Ziegler was on his way into the draft room, a large square conference room on the third floor of the Raiders\u2019 facility six miles west of the Vegas Strip. He stopped by the floor-to-ceiling photograph of the man who lords over this franchise 12 years after his death, and Ziegler patted the photograph of Al Davis .\n\u201cGoosebumps,\u201d Ziegler said. \u201cI feel his presence every day.\u201d\nThen Ziegler\u201447, in gray suit, black Oxford shirt, no tie, white and black sneakers\u2014entered the draft room, where 13 scouts, personnel people, one coach and one owner would plot the immediate future of Al Davis\u2019 team. At 4:59 p.m., 11 minutes before the draft kicked off, owner Mark Davis slipped into the room, in his white satin Raiders jacket and stonewashed faded jeans.\n\u201cGameday, baby!\u201d Son of Al announced to the room.\nGameday, as Mark Davis said. \u201cWe\u2019re still undefeated!\u201d Davis said as Roger Goodell kicked off the draft. One wall taken up entirely with the draft board, ranking the players by position from top to bottom, on magnetic cards, the old-school way. One wall, controlled by pro personnel director Dwayne Joseph , with pick-by-pick order and team-by-team needs that change with every pick. One wall, which McDaniels, Ziegler, assistant GM Champ Kelly and Davis face, with three things: a big TV tuned to the draft, computerized pick-by-pick directly from the league, so it\u2019s faster than what you see on TV, and a constantly updated list of trade discussions with draft-trade charts showing trade proposals broken down by a value chart.\nKelly, Ziegler (cell phone to his ear at least half of the evening), McDaniels, Davis, left to right in front of the room, in swivel chairs, able to look ahead at trade possibilities or back at the state of the draft board. Ziegler flitted from senior personnel adviser Shaun Herock to McDaniels to Davis to Kelly to director of football analytics David Christoff to senior national scouts DuJuan Daniels, Andy Dengler and Lenny McGill , having mostly hushed conversations.\n5:18 p.m. PT: Panthers picked Young. \u201cThis is where the draft starts,\u201d Ziegler, stating the obvious, said.\nFour minutes later, the tinny voice from draft headquarters said, \u201cHouston has made its pick. Arizona now on the clock.\u201d All eyes turn to the board where the pick will show up first. C.J. Stroud , QB, Ohio State popped onto the screen. \u201cOooooh,\u201d someone in the room said. Seven minutes passed. Arizona traded down to 12 with Houston. Big compensation: For this pick and a fourth- this year, the Texans gave the Colts the 12 th and 33 rd overall picks this year and their first- and third-round picks next year.\n5:32 p.m.: Will Anderson to Houston at three. One Vegas target down.\n5:33 p.m.: Ziegler on his cell, briefly. Ziegler to McDaniels in a hushed tone: \u201cArizona wants to trade back up.\u201d\nZiegler and McDaniels stared at the trade-value board in the back of the room, analyzing trade possibilities\u2014the values, plus or minus for the Raiders, based on the numerical values Ziegler assigns to each pick:\n1-7 down to 1-12\nPotential Counters\n+177 ARI sends 2-33, LV gives back 4 th (109)\n+68 ARI sends 2-33 and 6-213, LV gives back 3-100 and 4-109\n+30 ARI sends 2-33, LV gives back 3-70\nAt 5:37 p.m., Anthony Richardson , the Florida quarterback, got picked by the Colts. The third quarterback was off the board. McDaniels beamed. He and Ziegler slapped hands. Now the Raiders were sure to get one of their four guys.\n5:42 p.m.: Cards GM Monti Ossenfort called Ziegler. Hushed discussion, presumably exchanging potential offers for the pick. Then Ziegler and McDaniels huddled. Having the 12 th and 33 rd overall picks, to go along with the Raiders\u2019 38 th choice, would be tempting. \u201cWe could get [Oklahoma tackle Anton] Harrison at 12,\u201d McDaniels said. The Raiders loved Harrison\u2014not as much as Johnson, but enough maybe to lose the fourth non-QB they love in order to pick up the 33 rd pick. They mulled.\nThe phone went cold for a few minutes. Seemed obvious Ossenfort wanted Paris Johnson . He had to be dealing with Detroit, trying to get ahead of Vegas to ensure getting Johnson. Smart move by Ossenfort, choosing not to close a deal for the seventh pick and instead dealing for the sixth\u2013ensuring that the Cards would get the tackle they wanted.\n5:47 p.m.: Witherspoon to Seattle at five. Detroit up. No action on Ziegler\u2019s phone. Not surprising. Arizona was targeting Johnson.\n5:50 p.m.: Tinny voice from Draft HQ: \u201cDetroit has traded its pick to Arizona. Arizona is on the clock.\u201d For Vegas, there goes day-one starting right tackle Paris Johnson.\n5:54 p.m. Paris Johnson to Arizona. \u201cLas Vegas is on the clock,\u201d tinny voice says.\nSo no real drama. The plan was preordained. There was no real debate now, no discussion about moving. Only this:\n5:58 p.m.: \u201cTyree, this is coach McDaniels. We\u2019re gonna turn the pick in here, and you\u2019re gonna be a Raider.\u201d\nIn a lull in front of the room, McDaniels said quietly: \u201cOur board was right. We needed three quarterbacks to go, and we\u2019re so happy we got one of the four non-quarterbacks who were our top-rated guys on the board. Look, we gotta rush the passer. We gotta go get [ Patrick] Mahomes and [ Justin] Herbert . That\u2019s four games a year for the next few years against these great young quarterbacks. And the AFC is full of these great young quarterbacks. This is a great outcome for us.\u201d\nThis is the draft. The Raiders needed long-term help opposite Maxx Crosby (edge player Chandler Jones is 33), and Anderson or Wilson would have been great. Witherspoon would have been great to add to a needy secondary. Johnson would have been great to bookend Kolton Miller . It\u2019s capricious. The choice wasn\u2019t up to Ziegler; other teams decided for him. But the vibe in the room, the smiles, showed this staff loves Wilson, even with the foot injury that made him an iffy candidate to some teams.\nIn his office 20 minutes later, McDaniels waited to be connected to Wilson to converse. \u201cI mean, hallelujah,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cHis motivation, his drive, how he handles adversity \u2026 off the charts. We value the TAP test (a test in the pre-draft process that measures mental toughness, drive and composure under pressure), and Tyree got one of the highest grades on it, a Green plus-plus. He\u2019ll fit in great here.\u201d\nMcDaniels\u2019 football ops guy, Tom Jones , walked in with a phone. Wilson. \u201cTyree, welcome to the nation,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cDude, I am so excited you\u2019re a Raider. I know you\u2019re gonna help us win a lot of games. So, just wanted to touch base on a few things. You\u2019re gonna talk to the media here in a bit. Wanted to give you a few points. Be humble, which you are. Stay away from predictions\u2014that way, you won\u2019t have to eat them later. Don\u2019t talk about timelines with your foot. You don\u2019t want your draft story to be all about your foot. Now, you got a fan base that\u2019s second to none. They\u2019re gonna love you. Just express how excited you\u2014which I know you are.\u201d\nBack in the Raiders draft room, after pick 19, Ziegler said, \u201cJosh, you wanna look at trades?\u201d On the board were four players with similar grades: Georgia defensive end Nolan Smith , Maryland corner Deonte Banks , Harrison the Oklahoma tackle, and Arkansas linebacker Drew Sanders . Close to them: Notre Dame tight end Michael Mayer .\nBut there wasn\u2019t much enthusiasm to deal after Banks and Harrison went off the board. Ziegler made a couple of calls about moving up to fill a hole left by the trade of tight end Darren Waller with Mayer, but never got far\u2014or appeared enthusiastic to do it.\n7:36 p.m.: Crosby sent a video message to Wilson, and in the draft room, Ziegler had it and he showed it to McDaniels and Davis on his phone. The tenor of the message: Congrats, Tyree. Now, time to go work, son. \u201cLove it,\u201d McDaniels said.\nThere are lulls in all drafts, and after Banks and Harrison went at 24 and 27, this was the Raider lull. Davis kept things interesting. When the TV showed a crestfallen Will Levis , undrafted, still in the green room in Kansas City, he said: \u201cSomeone should tell him careers are not made on draft day. Tell him this happened to Aaron Rodgers too.\u201d And when he looked up and saw speedy Jalin Hyatt , the wide receiver, still on the board with a high Raider grade, Davis said to McDaniels: \u201cToo bad we don\u2019t have a need at receiver. Can he run?\u201d\n\u201cLike the wind,\u201d McDaniels said.\nDavis started laughing, like he could sense Ziegler and McDaniels did not want him to start lobbying for the best speed receiver in the draft.\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of my DNA,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI see a fast receiver, I want him. I can\u2019t help it.\u201d Spoken like his father\u2019s son.\nAs the round wound down, quietly, I asked Davis what he thought of Ziegler and McDaniels, the ex-Pats, entering year two of their regime. \u201cI like \u2018em,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we hired them, everybody thought we were trying to re-create the Patriots. That wasn\u2019t it. I was trying to find two great football men. Now, this is their chance to build something. They\u2019re young, they love football, and I\u2019m thrilled with them. It\u2019s a huge weekend for them.\n\u201cMy dad\u2019s drafts were different\u2014a lot more tense.\u201d\n\u201cThe tense conversations were already had,\u201d McDaniels said later. \u201cWe had them in the last six weeks. We ended up with the board where we all felt it needed to be.\u201d\n8:30 p.m.: Two picks left, including Kansas City at 31. Mayer on the mind in the draft room. \u201cIf KC comes back to us,\u201d Ziegler said, \u201cwanna do it?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said McDaniels.\n\u201cBest tight end in the draft,\u201d Kelly said.\nShort conversation with KC. \u201cNot gonna work,\u201d Ziegler said. KC would have given 31 and 217 (sixth round) for 38 and 70, a net on the points chart of minus-147. \u201cToo many players we like,\u201d Ziegler said. (Ziegler, on Friday, traded from 38 to 35 with the Colts to snag Mayer, the tight end Vegas wanted above all.)\nAn hour after the round ended, McDaniels and Ziegler unwound in the draft room. Wilson underwent surgery by the top athletic foot surgeon in the field, Dr. Robert Anderson, to repair a fracture last Nov. 21. Six weeks ago, Anderson sent a letter to each team, saying Wilson has responded \u201cextremely well\u201d to surgery. The Raiders expect Wilson to be ready to play this season on schedule. \u201cOur doctors ultimately felt like it was something that we were going to be okay with,\u201d Ziegler said. \u201cIf we wouldn\u2019t have felt comfortable with it, we wouldn\u2019t have [picked Wilson].\u201d\nIn all, the needy Raiders, trying to rebound from a few years of failed top picks, got two likely starters out of the draft\u2014Wilson and Mayer. After that, it\u2019s up in the air, as all drafts are. The Raiders got their presumptive backup to Jimmy Garoppolo , Aidan O\u2019Connell , in the middle of the fourth round\u2014about two rounds earlier than the consensus of where he deserved to go. They got a speed cornerback, Banks\u2019 teammate Jakorian Bennett , with pick 104, and the Raiders hope he plays early.\nMel Kiper, for one, liked the first two picks but the others, not so much. After the top two, Kiper said, \u201cI don\u2019t see value with the rest of this class.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why they play the games. In three years, we\u2019ll see if Ziegler picked right in the NFL\u2019s 88 th draft.", "source_raw_text": "After finishing 9-8 last season, the Miami Dolphins clinched the final AFC Wild Card spot with an 11-6 win over the New York Jets in Week 18 . With new head coach Mike McDaniel leading the charge, the Dolphins hope to win their first Super Bowl since 1973. However, the team faces an uphill battle as the offense, built around 3rd-year QB Tua Tagovailoa \u2013will have to continue to operate without its starter.

HOUSTON\u2014Two big stories here when I landed from Vegas: Drafting a franchise quarterback. Paying franchise-quarterback draft capital to draft a defensive end. There\u2019s no other way to put it: After picking C.J. Stroud second overall, the Texans traded up nine slots, from 12 to three in the first round, to take Alabama defensive end Will Anderson . Houston GM Nick Caserio traded 12 and 34 this year and first- and third-round picks next year to just barely squeeze the trade into the NFL\u2019s 10-minute window for the third pick. As I explain in the next item about Arizona\u2019s draft, Houston could be picking very early next year\u2014which will put a white hot spotlight of pressure on Anderson. Caserio told me at NRG Stadium that Stroud was clearly the team\u2019s target at two. He\u2019d had some discussions with Cards GM Monti Ossenfort about possibly moving from 12 to three. \u201cThen,\u201d Caserio said, \u201cit happened pretty quickly when they were on the clock.\u201d The deal got done and all parties notified, he said, with \u201cclose to a minute\u201d left. So the Texans got a player they hope will be their franchise QB, and they got the best defensive player on their board. That is one heck of a night\u2019s work. The price, of course, is denuding the 2024 draft when the Texans might wish they had two first-round picks and four in the first three rounds\u2014instead of now just one first-round pick, one second- and no thirds. But \u2013 and there is a big but \u2013 you should have been at the Texans\u2019 facility in the basement of NRG Stadium late Friday afternoon, when Stroud and Anderson put on a show of humility and team-firstness that had to make Texans fans so weary of losing (a league-worst 11-38-1 in the last three years) happy for the first time since the Wild Card win over Buffalo three years ago. Stroud and Anderson came with their families and made it clear they were all-in on going to a losing team after years of nothing but winning in college. Afterward, Stroud told me: \u201cThat\u2019s what life is about, working to build something good. That\u2019s what I\u2019m here to help this team do. I\u2019m ready for it.\u201d The Texans have asked Stroud to let the S-2 Test controversy go, but he got a couple last licks in on it. A player who played the way Stroud did\u2014particularly in putting up 41 points in his superb final college game in the playoff against Georgia\u2014is not a player who can\u2019t process, or can\u2019t ID a defense. I understand using every tool in the bag to analyze players before the draft, and I\u2019d check out why Stroud scored low on the test. But to think it\u2019s a good indicator of future failure\u2014I mean, watch the games he\u2019s played. We stood in a hallway just off the Texans\u2019 locker room for 12 minutes and I asked him about what he\u2019s learned from the last three months. \u201cHumility is something I\u2019m not afraid of,\u201d Stroud said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019m accustomed to. This was all probably just a humble moment God wanted me to go through. \u201c A lot of people haven\u2019t played the sport, and I mean critics are gonna critique. For me I know the film speaks for itself. Everything that I\u2019ve done in college, I\u2019ve been very consistent. I think I\u2019ve been one of the most consistent players in college football for the last two years. If you turn on the tape, you can see, you can answer the questions. But those who don\u2019t understand tape might want to go to other things and analyze other things. They\u2019re more than welcome to do such. But the people who are making the choices and the picks, they knew what I can do. They understood the IQ that I do have. \u201cI have a great memory when it comes to football,\u201d Stroud added. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s different ways to be geniuses. You don\u2019t just have to be book smart. You can be analytics smart. You can be numbers smart. You can be football smart. I really think that there\u2019s different types of ways to be smart. That\u2019s something that I pride myself on. And I am book smart. I did have over a 3.0 in college. I had over a 3.0 in high school. I know that I can think. I can process very, very fast. The film, you can see me going from first option to second and then back to one and then to three to four if I have to. I can check down. I can use my feet. \u201cBut, you know, everything happens for a reason. I\u2019m not upset. I\u2019m actually blessed, I\u2019m super blessed to be a Texan. Number two overall pick in the NFL draft, man. A little kid from the [California] Inland Empire. All smiles, man. I ain\u2019t tripping about this.\u201d Good attitude to have. But at the same time, I could feel it: C.J. Stroud will remember this pre-draft process. And for the Texans, that bit of motivation will be a very good thing. HENDERSON, Nev.\u2014Just before noon on Thursday, hours before the start of the NFL Draft, Raiders coach Josh McDaniels popped into GM Dave Ziegler \u2019s office for one last bit of strategy talk. The team\u2019s draft board had been set with finality Wednesday, after three months of debate. The Raiders, after conversations with teams above them about trading up from number seven in the first round, decided to stay in their slot, barring a surprise. \u201cWhat we need is for three quarterbacks to go before we pick,\u201d McDaniels said.

No surprise, all this mystery. This is the modern draft, where lips are no longer loose, where mock drafts are a mockery of reality. It sounds counterintuitive, but in the hours before the NFL Draft, the people running drafts for $6 billion franchises didn\u2019t know much more than the rest of us. Ziegler and McDaniels did know by staying put\u2014and they would get a phone call that surprised and tempted them minutes before their pick\u2014they were not in control of their fate. They needed help. The Raiders needed two teams post-Carolina to pick passers in the next five picks. Likely. Not certain. At 4:43 p.m. Pacific Time, Ziegler was on his way into the draft room, a large square conference room on the third floor of the Raiders\u2019 facility six miles west of the Vegas Strip. He stopped by the floor-to-ceiling photograph of the man who lords over this franchise 12 years after his death, and Ziegler patted the photograph of Al Davis . \u201cGoosebumps,\u201d Ziegler said. \u201cI feel his presence every day.\u201d Then Ziegler\u201447, in gray suit, black Oxford shirt, no tie, white and black sneakers\u2014entered the draft room, where 13 scouts, personnel people, one coach and one owner would plot the immediate future of Al Davis\u2019 team. At 4:59 p.m., 11 minutes before the draft kicked off, owner Mark Davis slipped into the room, in his white satin Raiders jacket and stonewashed faded jeans. \u201cGameday, baby!\u201d Son of Al announced to the room. Gameday, as Mark Davis said. \u201cWe\u2019re still undefeated!\u201d Davis said as Roger Goodell kicked off the draft. One wall taken up entirely with the draft board, ranking the players by position from top to bottom, on magnetic cards, the old-school way. One wall, controlled by pro personnel director Dwayne Joseph , with pick-by-pick order and team-by-team needs that change with every pick. One wall, which McDaniels, Ziegler, assistant GM Champ Kelly and Davis face, with three things: a big TV tuned to the draft, computerized pick-by-pick directly from the league, so it\u2019s faster than what you see on TV, and a constantly updated list of trade discussions with draft-trade charts showing trade proposals broken down by a value chart. Kelly, Ziegler (cell phone to his ear at least half of the evening), McDaniels, Davis, left to right in front of the room, in swivel chairs, able to look ahead at trade possibilities or back at the state of the draft board. Ziegler flitted from senior personnel adviser Shaun Herock to McDaniels to Davis to Kelly to director of football analytics David Christoff to senior national scouts DuJuan Daniels, Andy Dengler and Lenny McGill , having mostly hushed conversations. 5:18 p.m. PT: Panthers picked Young. \u201cThis is where the draft starts,\u201d Ziegler, stating the obvious, said. Four minutes later, the tinny voice from draft headquarters said, \u201cHouston has made its pick. Arizona now on the clock.\u201d All eyes turn to the board where the pick will show up first. C.J. Stroud , QB, Ohio State popped onto the screen. \u201cOooooh,\u201d someone in the room said. Seven minutes passed. Arizona traded down to 12 with Houston. Big compensation: For this pick and a fourth- this year, the Texans gave the Colts the 12 th and 33 rd overall picks this year and their first- and third-round picks next year. 5:32 p.m.: Will Anderson to Houston at three. One Vegas target down. 5:33 p.m.: Ziegler on his cell, briefly. Ziegler to McDaniels in a hushed tone: \u201cArizona wants to trade back up.\u201d Ziegler and McDaniels stared at the trade-value board in the back of the room, analyzing trade possibilities\u2014the values, plus or minus for the Raiders, based on the numerical values Ziegler assigns to each pick: 1-7 down to 1-12 Potential Counters +177 ARI sends 2-33, LV gives back 4 th (109) +68 ARI sends 2-33 and 6-213, LV gives back 3-100 and 4-109 +30 ARI sends 2-33, LV gives back 3-70 At 5:37 p.m., Anthony Richardson , the Florida quarterback, got picked by the Colts. The third quarterback was off the board. McDaniels beamed. He and Ziegler slapped hands. Now the Raiders were sure to get one of their four guys. 5:42 p.m.: Cards GM Monti Ossenfort called Ziegler. Hushed discussion, presumably exchanging potential offers for the pick. Then Ziegler and McDaniels huddled. Having the 12 th and 33 rd overall picks, to go along with the Raiders\u2019 38 th choice, would be tempting. \u201cWe could get [Oklahoma tackle Anton] Harrison at 12,\u201d McDaniels said. The Raiders loved Harrison\u2014not as much as Johnson, but enough maybe to lose the fourth non-QB they love in order to pick up the 33 rd pick. They mulled. The phone went cold for a few minutes. Seemed obvious Ossenfort wanted Paris Johnson . He had to be dealing with Detroit, trying to get ahead of Vegas to ensure getting Johnson. Smart move by Ossenfort, choosing not to close a deal for the seventh pick and instead dealing for the sixth\u2013ensuring that the Cards would get the tackle they wanted. 5:47 p.m.: Witherspoon to Seattle at five. Detroit up. No action on Ziegler\u2019s phone. Not surprising. Arizona was targeting Johnson. 5:50 p.m.: Tinny voice from Draft HQ: \u201cDetroit has traded its pick to Arizona. Arizona is on the clock.\u201d For Vegas, there goes day-one starting right tackle Paris Johnson. 5:54 p.m. Paris Johnson to Arizona. \u201cLas Vegas is on the clock,\u201d tinny voice says. So no real drama. The plan was preordained. There was no real debate now, no discussion about moving. Only this: 5:58 p.m.: \u201cTyree, this is coach McDaniels. We\u2019re gonna turn the pick in here, and you\u2019re gonna be a Raider.\u201d In a lull in front of the room, McDaniels said quietly: \u201cOur board was right. We needed three quarterbacks to go, and we\u2019re so happy we got one of the four non-quarterbacks who were our top-rated guys on the board. Look, we gotta rush the passer. We gotta go get [ Patrick] Mahomes and [ Justin] Herbert . That\u2019s four games a year for the next few years against these great young quarterbacks. And the AFC is full of these great young quarterbacks. This is a great outcome for us.\u201d This is the draft. The Raiders needed long-term help opposite Maxx Crosby (edge player Chandler Jones is 33), and Anderson or Wilson would have been great. Witherspoon would have been great to add to a needy secondary. Johnson would have been great to bookend Kolton Miller . It\u2019s capricious. The choice wasn\u2019t up to Ziegler; other teams decided for him. But the vibe in the room, the smiles, showed this staff loves Wilson, even with the foot injury that made him an iffy candidate to some teams. In his office 20 minutes later, McDaniels waited to be connected to Wilson to converse. \u201cI mean, hallelujah,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cHis motivation, his drive, how he handles adversity \u2026 off the charts. We value the TAP test (a test in the pre-draft process that measures mental toughness, drive and composure under pressure), and Tyree got one of the highest grades on it, a Green plus-plus. He\u2019ll fit in great here.\u201d McDaniels\u2019 football ops guy, Tom Jones , walked in with a phone. Wilson. \u201cTyree, welcome to the nation,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cDude, I am so excited you\u2019re a Raider. I know you\u2019re gonna help us win a lot of games. So, just wanted to touch base on a few things. You\u2019re gonna talk to the media here in a bit. Wanted to give you a few points. Be humble, which you are. Stay away from predictions\u2014that way, you won\u2019t have to eat them later. Don\u2019t talk about timelines with your foot. You don\u2019t want your draft story to be all about your foot. Now, you got a fan base that\u2019s second to none. They\u2019re gonna love you. Just express how excited you\u2014which I know you are.\u201d Back in the Raiders draft room, after pick 19, Ziegler said, \u201cJosh, you wanna look at trades?\u201d On the board were four players with similar grades: Georgia defensive end Nolan Smith , Maryland corner Deonte Banks , Harrison the Oklahoma tackle, and Arkansas linebacker Drew Sanders . Close to them: Notre Dame tight end Michael Mayer . But there wasn\u2019t much enthusiasm to deal after Banks and Harrison went off the board. Ziegler made a couple of calls about moving up to fill a hole left by the trade of tight end Darren Waller with Mayer, but never got far\u2014or appeared enthusiastic to do it. 7:36 p.m.: Crosby sent a video message to Wilson, and in the draft room, Ziegler had it and he showed it to McDaniels and Davis on his phone. The tenor of the message: Congrats, Tyree. Now, time to go work, son. \u201cLove it,\u201d McDaniels said. There are lulls in all drafts, and after Banks and Harrison went at 24 and 27, this was the Raider lull. Davis kept things interesting. When the TV showed a crestfallen Will Levis , undrafted, still in the green room in Kansas City, he said: \u201cSomeone should tell him careers are not made on draft day. Tell him this happened to Aaron Rodgers too.\u201d And when he looked up and saw speedy Jalin Hyatt , the wide receiver, still on the board with a high Raider grade, Davis said to McDaniels: \u201cToo bad we don\u2019t have a need at receiver. Can he run?\u201d \u201cLike the wind,\u201d McDaniels said. Davis started laughing, like he could sense Ziegler and McDaniels did not want him to start lobbying for the best speed receiver in the draft. \u201cIt\u2019s part of my DNA,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI see a fast receiver, I want him. I can\u2019t help it.\u201d Spoken like his father\u2019s son. As the round wound down, quietly, I asked Davis what he thought of Ziegler and McDaniels, the ex-Pats, entering year two of their regime. \u201cI like \u2018em,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we hired them, everybody thought we were trying to re-create the Patriots. That wasn\u2019t it. I was trying to find two great football men. Now, this is their chance to build something. They\u2019re young, they love football, and I\u2019m thrilled with them. It\u2019s a huge weekend for them. \u201cMy dad\u2019s drafts were different\u2014a lot more tense.\u201d \u201cThe tense conversations were already had,\u201d McDaniels said later. \u201cWe had them in the last six weeks. We ended up with the board where we all felt it needed to be.\u201d 8:30 p.m.: Two picks left, including Kansas City at 31. Mayer on the mind in the draft room. \u201cIf KC comes back to us,\u201d Ziegler said, \u201cwanna do it?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said McDaniels. \u201cBest tight end in the draft,\u201d Kelly said. Short conversation with KC. \u201cNot gonna work,\u201d Ziegler said. KC would have given 31 and 217 (sixth round) for 38 and 70, a net on the points chart of minus-147. \u201cToo many players we like,\u201d Ziegler said. (Ziegler, on Friday, traded from 38 to 35 with the Colts to snag Mayer, the tight end Vegas wanted above all.) An hour after the round ended, McDaniels and Ziegler unwound in the draft room. Wilson underwent surgery by the top athletic foot surgeon in the field, Dr. Robert Anderson, to repair a fracture last Nov. 21. Six weeks ago, Anderson sent a letter to each team, saying Wilson has responded \u201cextremely well\u201d to surgery. The Raiders expect Wilson to be ready to play this season on schedule. \u201cOur doctors ultimately felt like it was something that we were going to be okay with,\u201d Ziegler said. \u201cIf we wouldn\u2019t have felt comfortable with it, we wouldn\u2019t have [picked Wilson].\u201d In all, the needy Raiders, trying to rebound from a few years of failed top picks, got two likely starters out of the draft\u2014Wilson and Mayer. After that, it\u2019s up in the air, as all drafts are. The Raiders got their presumptive backup to Jimmy Garoppolo , Aidan O\u2019Connell , in the middle of the fourth round\u2014about two rounds earlier than the consensus of where he deserved to go. They got a speed cornerback, Banks\u2019 teammate Jakorian Bennett , with pick 104, and the Raiders hope he plays early. Mel Kiper, for one, liked the first two picks but the others, not so much. After the top two, Kiper said, \u201cI don\u2019t see value with the rest of this class.\u201d That\u2019s why they play the games. In three years, we\u2019ll see if Ziegler picked right in the NFL\u2019s 88 th draft.", "documentFile": "https://sports.nbcsports.com/2023/01/11/dolphins-super-bowl-history-when-is-the-last-time-miami-made-it-to-won-the-super-bowl/"}], "set_of_highlights_in_context": [{"source_supports_statement": "complete_support", "docSentText": "\nThe Miami Dolphins have appeared in the Super Bowl 5 times, in 1971, 1972, 1973, 1982 and 1984.", "docSpanText": "The Miami Dolphins have appeared in the Super Bowl 5 times, in 1971, 1972, 1973, 1982 and 1984.", "docSentCharIdx": 1228.0, "problematic_instance": "no", "is_split": "yes", "docSpanOffsets": [[1229, 1324]], "sent_idx": 14.0, "scuSentence": "The Miami Dolphins have won the Super Bowl a total of **2 times** in their **5 appearances**.", "scuSentCharIdx": 0, "documentFile": "https://champsorchumps.us/team/nfl/miami-dolphins", "statement_supported": "Yes", "prefix": ""}, {"source_supports_statement": "complete_support", "docSentText": "\nThe Miami Dolphins won the Super Bowl 2 times, in 1972 and 1973.", "docSpanText": "\nThe Miami Dolphins won the Super Bowl 2 times, in 1972 and 1973.", "docSentCharIdx": 1324.0, "problematic_instance": "no", "is_split": "yes", "docSpanOffsets": [[1324, 1389]], "sent_idx": 15.0, "scuSentence": "The Miami Dolphins have won the Super Bowl a total of **2 times** in their **5 appearances**.", "scuSentCharIdx": 0, "documentFile": "https://champsorchumps.us/team/nfl/miami-dolphins", "statement_supported": "Yes", "prefix": ""}, {"source_supports_statement": "complete_support", "docSentText": "\nThe Miami Dolphins have won the Super Bowl a total of 2 times in their 5 appearances.", "docSpanText": "The Miami Dolphins have won the Super Bowl a total of 2 times in their 5 appearances", "docSentCharIdx": 644.0, "problematic_instance": "no", "is_split": "no", "docSpanOffsets": [[645, 729]], "sent_idx": 5.0, "scuSentence": "The Miami Dolphins have won the Super Bowl a total of **2 times** in their **5 appearances**.", "scuSentCharIdx": 0, "documentFile": "https://sports.nbcsports.com/2023/01/11/dolphins-super-bowl-history-when-is-the-last-time-miami-made-it-to-won-the-super-bowl/", "statement_supported": "Yes", "prefix": ""}, {"source_supports_statement": "complete_support", "docSentText": "\nThe last time the Miami Dolphins hoisted up the Lombardi Trophy was in 1973 when they defeated the Minnesota Vikings 24-7 in Super Bowl VIII.", "docSpanText": "The last time the Miami Dolphins hoisted up the Lombardi Trophy was in 1973 when they defeated the Minnesota Vikings 24-7 in Super Bowl VIII.", "docSentCharIdx": 870.0, "problematic_instance": "no", "is_split": "no", "docSpanOffsets": [[871, 1012]], "sent_idx": 7.0, "scuSentence": "Their most recent Super Bowl win was in **1973** when they defeated the Minnesota Vikings 24-7 in Super Bowl VIII.", "scuSentCharIdx": 94, "documentFile": "https://sports.nbcsports.com/2023/01/11/dolphins-super-bowl-history-when-is-the-last-time-miami-made-it-to-won-the-super-bowl/", "statement_supported": "Yes", "prefix": "The Miami Dolphins have won the Super Bowl a total of **2 times** in their **5 appearances**.

For the first few years, the Dolphins' full-time training camp and practice facilities were at Saint Andrew's School , a private, boys boarding prep school in Boca Raton. Miami joined the NFL as a result of the 1970 AFL\u2013NFL merger .\nThe team played in its first Super Bowl in Super Bowl VI , losing to the Dallas Cowboys , 24\u20133. The following year , the Dolphins completed the NFL's only perfect season , culminating in a Super Bowl win, winning all 14 of their regular-season games, and all three of their playoff games, including Super Bowl VII . They were the third NFL team to accomplish a perfect regular season , and remain the only team to do so since the AFL-NFL merger, the time known as the Super Bowl era. The next year, the Dolphins won Super Bowl VIII , becoming the first team to appear in three consecutive Super Bowls, and the second team (the first AFL/AFC team) to win back-to-back championships. Miami also appeared in Super Bowl XVII and Super Bowl XIX , losing both games.\nFor most of their early history, the Dolphins were coached by Don Shula , the most successful head coach in professional football history in terms of total games won. Under Shula, the Dolphins posted losing records in only two of his 26 seasons as the head coach. During the period spanning 1983 to the end of 1999, quarterback Dan Marino became one of the most prolific passers in NFL history, breaking numerous league passing records. Marino led the Dolphins to five division titles, 10 playoff appearances, and an appearance in Super Bowl XIX before retiring following the 1999 season .\nSince Marino's retirement, they have experienced mediocre levels of success and have just five playoff appearances ( 2000 , 2001 , 2008 , 2016 , and 2022 ) and two division titles ( 2000 and 2008 ).\nThe Miami Dolphins joined the American Football League (AFL) when an expansion franchise was awarded to lawyer Joseph Robbie and actor Danny Thomas in 1965 for $7.5 million, although Thomas would eventually sell his stake in the team to Robbie. [7] During the summer of 1966, the Dolphins' training camp was in St. Pete Beach with practices in August at Boca Ciega High School in Gulfport . [8]\nThe Dolphins were the worst team with a 15\u201339\u20132 record in their first four seasons under head coach George Wilson , before Don Shula was hired as head coach. Shula was a Paul Brown disciple who had been lured from the Baltimore Colts , after losing Super Bowl III two seasons earlier to the AFL's New York Jets , and finishing 8\u20135\u20131 the following season. Shula got his first NFL coaching job from then-Detroit head coach George Wilson, who hired him as the defensive coordinator. The AFL merged with the NFL in 1970, and the Dolphins were assigned to the AFC East division in the NFL's new American Football Conference .\nFor the rest of the 20th century, the Shula-led Dolphins emerged as one of the most dominant teams in the NFL, with only two losing seasons between 1970 and 1999. They were extremely successful in the 1970s, completing the first complete perfect season in NFL history by finishing with a 14\u20130 regular-season record in 1972 and winning the Super Bowl that year . It was the first of two consecutive Super Bowl wins and one of three appearances in a row. The 1980s and 1990s were also moderately successful. The early 80s teams made two Super Bowls despite losing both times and saw the emergence of future Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino , who went on to break numerous NFL passing records, holding many of them until the late 2000s. After winning every game against the division rival Buffalo Bills in the 1970s, the two teams gradually developed a competitive rivalry in the 80s and 90s, often competing for AFC supremacy when Jim Kelly emerged as the quarterback for the Bills. The Dolphins have also maintained a strong rivalry with the New York Jets throughout much of their history.\nFollowing the retirements of Marino and Shula and the rise of Tom Brady and the New England Patriots , the Dolphins suffered a decline in the 2000s and 2010s. During this period, the team's level of play was largely described as mediocre. [9] [10] [11] They have only made the playoffs four times since Marino's retirement and have largely been unable to find a consistent quarterback to replace him. The team suffered a franchise-worst 1\u201315 season in 2007 . They rebounded the following season , becoming the first team in NFL history to win their division and make a playoff appearance following a league-worst season . [ citation needed ] That same season, the Dolphins upset the New England Patriots on the road during Week 3 thanks to the use of the gimmick Wildcat offense , which handed the Patriots their first regular-season loss since December 10, 2006, in which coincidentally, they were also beaten by the Dolphins. However, this success in 2008 proved to be an outlier during this period in the franchise's history; to date, it is the last season the Dolphins won the AFC East. [12] However, the Dolphins have been competitive against the Patriots despite their decline, with notable wins coming in 2004, 2008, 2014, 2018 , and 2019. Until 2020, they were also the last team in the AFC East to win the division championship aside from the Patriots, doing so in 2008.\n|Season||Coach||Super Bowl||Location||Opponent||Score||Record|\n|1972||Don Shula||VII||L.A.

The rivalry was extremely lopsided in favor of Miami during the 1970s, as the Dolphins won all 20 games against the Bills during that decade. Fortunes changed in the 1980s and 1990s when Jim Kelly became the Bills' starting quarterback. Though both teams were extremely dominant during that period, the Bills ultimately held the edge and dominated the Dolphins during their four playoff matchups in the 1990s, with the Dolphins' only playoff win coming after Kelly's retirement. With the rise of Tom Brady and the Patriots during the 2000s and the retirements of Kelly and Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino , the Bills-Dolphins rivalry faded in relevance, but remains somewhat intense to this day. Some former Dolphins have gone to play for the Bills as well, most notably Dan Carpenter , Chris Hogan , and Charles Clay .\nIn the 2020s, the rivalry sharpened, with Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa , drafted in 2020, leading a resurgent Dolphins team against the Josh Allen -led Bills, who had gained a streak of success after Brady's departure from the Patriots and the division. Though Allen's career record against Miami currently stands at 9\u20132, Tagovailoa led the Dolphins to their first win over Bills in 8 games in 2022, and the Dolphins played the Bills tightly in the teams' two other meetings that year despite losing both, including the playoffs.\nMain article: Dolphins\u2013Patriots rivalry\nThe Dolphins dominated the New England Patriots during the 1970s and the 1990s, but there were some notable moments as well, including a 1982 game now known as the Snowplow Game . Fortunes changed when Tom Brady became the franchise quarterback for the Patriots, and during his tenure with the Patriots , New England dominated the AFC, especially the AFC East, winning 16 of 17 division titles between 2003 and 2019, with the Dolphins winning the only non-Patriots division title in that time frame when Brady was out due to injury. Miami posed the biggest divisional challenge to the Brady-led Patriots, however, winning more games against them than the Bills or Jets did during that era. [13] [14]\nNotable wins over New England by the Dolphins include the Miracle in Miami , which involved a dramatic last-minute game-winning touchdown that paralleled \"The Night that Courage Wore Orange\", where in 2004 , the Dolphins, at 2\u201311, upset the defending Super Bowl champion Patriots 28\u201329, and handed them the second of their 2 losses that season. [15] The rivalry briefly intensified in 2005 when Nick Saban , Bill Belichick 's former Browns defensive coordinator was hired as their new head coach and when Saban nearly signed quarterback Drew Brees , as well as in 2008, when the two teams battled for the AFC East division title. Miami and New England are also the only two franchises to have posted undefeated regular-season records since the NFL-AFL merger, with Miami going 14\u20130 in 1972 and New England going 16\u20130 in 2007 , but only the 1972 Dolphins were able to win the Super Bowl.\nMain article: Dolphins\u2013Jets rivalry\nThe New York Jets are perhaps Miami's most bitter rivals. [16] Dolphins fans despise the Jets due to the sheer amount of New York City transplants who have moved to South Florida and the Jets' usual cocky demeanor. Just as the Bills-Dolphins rivalry is motivated by differences, the Dolphins-Jets series is also notable for the differences between New York and Miami. Unlike the former, this rivalry has been more consistent over the years. Some of the more memorable moments in this rivalry include Dan Marino 's fake spike , Vinny Testaverde leading the Jets to a notable comeback on Monday Night Football , and former Jets quarterback Chad Pennington signing with the Dolphins and leading them to a divisional title. The two teams have also played in the 1982 AFC Championship , with Miami winning to face the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XVII .\nMain article: Buccaneers\u2013Dolphins rivalry\nSince the founding of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1976, the Dolphins and Buccaneers have shared a mellow in-state rivalry and were the only two teams in Florida until the Jacksonville Jaguars joined the NFL in 1995.\nWhen the then- Baltimore Colts were inserted into the AFC East following the AFL/NFL merger, they sparked a heated rivalry with the Dolphins, as a controversy involving the hiring of former Colts coach Don Shula forced Miami to forfeit a first-round draft pick. The Dolphins and Colts faced off several times in the AFC playoffs during the 1970s, including the AFC championship game leading up to Super Bowl VI , which the Dolphins lost to the Dallas Cowboys . The rivalry cooled down in the 1980s after the Colts struggled and moved to Indianapolis , but heated up once again in the late 90s until the Colts were reassigned into the AFC South as a result of the 2002 realignment of the NFL's divisions. [17]\nThe Dolphins also share historic rivalries with other AFC teams such as the Las Vegas Raiders , Los Angeles Chargers , and Pittsburgh Steelers , stemming from often competing against these teams in the playoffs during the Don Shula era, and to a lesser extent, the Jacksonville Jaguars , who also represent the state of Florida. [17]\nThe Dolphins originally played all home games in the Orange Bowl in Miami. They moved to the new Joe Robbie Stadium after the 1986 season. From 1993 to 2011, the Dolphins shared the stadium with Major League Baseball 's Florida Marlins (now known as the Miami Marlins). The venue has had multiple naming rights deals since 1996 , carrying the names Pro Player Stadium, Dolphins Stadium, Dolphin Stadium, LandShark Stadium, Sun Life Stadium, New Miami Stadium and, as of August 2016, Hard Rock Stadium . The facility is located in Miami Gardens , a suburb of Miami located approximately 15 miles (24 km) north of downtown Miami. The Miami Dolphins share Hard Rock Stadium with the NCAA Miami Hurricanes . The 2015\u20132016 season was the first season in the newly renovated Hard Rock Stadium. The Dolphins spent more than two years and over $400 million on a major overhaul to Hard Rock Stadium. Every seat was replaced and the lower-level seats were moved closer to the field. There are roughly 10,000 fewer seats. [18]\nSt. Petersburg Beach hosted the Dolphins' first training camp in 1966. St. Andrew's School in Boca Raton hosted training camp in the late 1960s. The Dolphins subsequently trained in Miami Gardens at Biscayne College, later renamed St. Thomas University , from 1970 until 1993.\nIn 1993, the Dolphins opened the Miami Dolphins Training Facility at Nova Southeastern University in Davie . In 2006, the facility added a domed field that allows the team to practice during thunderstorms which are common in the area during the summer. [19]\nIn 2021, the Dolphins opened a new, 135 million training facility, dubbed the Baptist Health Training Complex, the Dolphins will practice in. The complex is located next to Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.\nThe Dolphins logo and uniforms remained fairly consistent from the team's founding through 2012. The team's colors were originally aqua and coral , with the coral color paying tribute to the Miami Seahawks and to the many natural coral reefs in Biscayne Bay. The team's original logo consisted of a sunburst with a leaping dolphin wearing a football helmet bearing the letter M. At their debut in 1966, a lighter & brighter orange was used instead of the deep coral color. The dolphin's head was near the center of the sunburst. In the 1967 season, the dolphin was centered on the sunburst, but it reverted to the original placement between 1968 and 1973. By 1974, the dolphin's body was centered on the sunburst in a slightly smaller logo than the 1967 version. The uniforms featured white pants with aqua and orange stripes, paired with either a white or aqua jersey. On the white jersey, aqua block numbers and names were outlined in orange, with aqua and orange sleeve stripes. Starting with the 1972 perfect season, these uniforms were used as the primary uniforms for road games and daytime home games, due to the extreme heat of South Florida. The team also had an aqua jersey used mainly for night home games or road games in which the opponent chose to wear white. The aqua jersey featured white block numbers and names with an orange outline, and orange and white sleeve stripes.\nAn update was given to the logo in 1997 \u2013 the sunburst was simplified and the dolphin was darkened and given a more serious game-face expression. [20] The uniforms remained the same; however, a different block number font was used and navy drop shadows were added.\nOn very rare occasions, an orange jersey was used for primetime games. The uniforms essentially swapped the location of orange and aqua from the aqua jersey. The orange jersey was first used on a Sunday night in 2003 against Washington , a Dolphin win. In 2004, the orange jersey was brought back for an Monday Night Football match pitting the 2\u201311 Dolphins against the 12\u20131 defending champion New England Patriots . The Dolphins scored a huge upset win after trailing by 11 points with less than 5 minutes remaining. Due to the unusual orange jerseys, the game has become known within some Dolphin circles as \" The Night That Courage Wore Orange \". [21] The orange jerseys were used for a 2009 Monday night win against the New York Jets . However, the Dolphins would lose a 2010 Sunday night matchup with the Jets, their first loss in orange, and the orange jerseys in the original style would not be worn again.\nIn 2009, the Dolphins switched to black shoes for the first time since the early 1970s glory days, following a recent trend among NFL teams. However, by 2011, they returned to wearing white shoes.\nThe Dolphins' final game in the original style uniforms with block numbers and the iconic leaping dolphin logo was the final game of the 2012 season, a 28\u20130 shutout loss to the New England Patriots in Foxboro . The white jerseys were worn for the game, and as rumors of a new look had been swirling, many fans watching knew that it would likely be the last time their team would wear the leaping dolphin logo.\nA radically new logo and new uniforms were unveiled shortly before the 2013 NFL Draft . [22] [23] [24] The new logo features a stylized aqua dolphin swimming in front of a heavily modified version of the orange sunburst. The dolphin in the logo is more vague and artistic, and is not wearing a helmet as it is merely a silhouette of a dolphin cast in aqua and navy.\nNavy was incorporated as featured color for the first time, with orange becoming greatly de-emphasized. The uniforms feature both white pants and aqua pants, with a white or aqua jersey. The Dolphins continue to wear white at home, just as they had with the previous uniforms, with aqua being used for primetime home games. The white jersey features aqua numbers and names in a unique custom font, with orange and navy outlines on the numbers; however, the names only use navy as an outline color. The aqua jerseys use white numbers with an orange and aqua outline, and white names with a navy outline. The helmets are white with a white facemask, just like the final years of the previous look; however, navy is a prominent color on the helmet stripe, joining aqua and a de-emphasized orange. Both jerseys have large \"Dolphins\" text above the numbers, written in the team's new script. The pants are either aqua or white, and contain no markings other than a small team wordmark. [25]\nIn 2018, the team made some slight modifications to the logo and uniform set: The shades of orange and aqua were tweaked, and navy blue was removed from the color scheme, only remaining on the logo. [26]\nIn 2015, the Dolphins brought back their 1970s aqua uniforms for a few select games. Four years later, they brought back a white version from the same era as a second alternate uniform. The aqua throwbacks were worn during the now-famous 2018 Miracle in Miami play against the Patriots.\nOn September 29, 2016, the Dolphins debuted their new Color Rush uniform in a Thursday Night Football game against the Cincinnati Bengals . The all-orange uniform marked the first time since 2010 that the Dolphins wore an orange uniform. However, the set was only used for that game as the Dolphins immediately retired the uniform soon after.\nIn later years, the Dolphins wore similar all-aqua or all-white uniforms in select games as the NFL gradually relaxed its rules regarding hosiery.\nThe song was written and composed by Lee Ofman, and has similar instrumentation and lyrics to the fight song of the Houston Oilers . Ofman approached the Dolphins with it before the 1972 season because he wanted music to inspire his favorite team. The fight song would soon serve as a good luck charm for the Dolphins that season. The Dolphins became the first team in NFL history to record an undefeated season, going 17\u20130 en route to victory over the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl VII . The following season, Miami posted an equally impressive 15\u20132 record and capped the season with another title, defeating the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl VIII . The back-to-back championship runs, coupled with the popularity of the fight song amongst Dolphins fans, have ensured the song's longevity. The Dolphins revealed a new fight song by T-Pain and Jimmy Buffett featuring Pitbull on August 7, 2009, which was introduced for the 2009 NFL season. [27] The fight song was played during the preseason home opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars on August 17, 2009, but was not played during the second preseason game against the Carolina Panthers on August 22, 2009, after being booed heavily in the first game. Furthermore, the team has preferred to play Buffett's song \" Fins \" after scores during the 2009 regular season instead of the traditional fight song.\nThe team's cheerleaders are known collectively as the Miami Dolphins Cheerleaders. [28] The company had its debut in 1978 as the Dolphins Starbrites. (The name referred to the co-sponsor, Starbrite Car Polish.) The cheerleaders' founding choreographer was June Taylor , famed colleague of Jackie Gleason , who led the squad until her retirement in 1990.\nIn April 2010, the Dolphins started the first Volunteer Program in the NFL. Special Teams is a unique volunteer organization created to enlist and mobilize the ongoing services of the community with the Dolphins staff, players and alumni. The mission of the Special Teams is to offer hands-on services to communities and families in need, to partner with existing organizations on worthwhile social, civic and charitable programs, to provide assistance at Miami Dolphins Foundation events, and to support community efforts in times of emergency. This program is headed by Leslie Nixon and Sergio Xiques. Since its inception, Special Teams has given over 250,000 community services hours to the South Florida and Mexico community. [29]\n(\"The Dolphin\") On Friday, April 18, 1997, the first \"official\" mascot of the Miami Dolphins was introduced. The 7-foot mascot made his public debut on April 19 at Pro Player Stadium during the team's draft-day party. The team then made a \"Name the Mascot\" contest that drew over 13,000 entries covering all 50 states and 22 countries. 529 names were suggested. The winning entry was announced at the annual Dolphins Awards Banquet on June 4, 1997.\nDenny Sym cheered on the Miami Dolphins for 33 years as a one-man sideline show, leading Miami crowds in cheers and chants in his glittering coral (orange) and aqua hat from the Dolphins\u2019 first game in 1966 until 2000. Sym died on March 18, 2007. He was 72. [30]\nMain article: Flipper\nFrom 1966 to 1968, and in the 1970s a live dolphin was situated in a water tank in the open (east) end of the Orange Bowl. He would jump in the tank to celebrate touchdowns and field goals. The tank that was set up in the 1970s was manufactured by Evan Bush and maintained during the games by Evan Bush and Dene Whitaker. Flipper was removed from the Orange Bowl after 1968 to save costs, and in the 1970s due to stress.\nIn August 2010, the team launched its own regional TV \"network\". The Dolphins Television Network comprises 10 South Florida TV stations that agreed to carry the team-produced coverage. [31] Preseason games are broadcast on television through WFOR-TV in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, WTVX in West Palm Beach, WBBH-TV in Fort Myers, and WRDQ in Orlando. Longtime TV and radio personality Dick Stockton provides play-by-play commentary, with Dolphins Hall-of-Fame QB Bob Griese and former Dolphins WR Nat Moore providing color commentary. The radio broadcast team features Jimmy Cefalo providing play-by-play commentary and Joe Rose providing color commentary during preseason games, along with Griese for regular-season games. [32] Griese replaced longtime color commentator Jim Mandich , who played for the Dolphins under Don Shula. Mandich lost his fight with cancer in 2011, opening the door for Griese as his replacement. Radio coverage as of the 2023 season will be provided by WINZ (940 AM) and WBGG-FM (105.9 FM). Additionally, games can also be heard in Spanish on WNMA (1210 AM), with Ra\u00fal Striker Jr. and Joaquin Duro providing play-by-play and color commentary, respectively.\nCBS-owned WFOR, in addition to preseason telecasts, airs most of the Dolphins' regular season games. If the team hosts an interconference opponent or plays on a Thursday night, WSVN , the local Fox affiliate will have the games being televised. When playing on Sunday night, the team's matches will be broadcast on WTVJ , the NBC O&O station.\nThe Dolphins' radio affiliates: [33] [34]\nThe Dolphins currently have ten players, and one coach enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame , that have spent the majority (or entirety) of their careers, or made significant contributions with the Miami Dolphins. Three other players and four contributors that have spent only a \"minor portion\" of their careers with the Dolphins, and have been enshrined primarily with other teams, have also been enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n|Miami Dolphins Hall of Famers|\n|Players|\n|No.||Name||College||Position||Season(s)||Inducted|\n|42||Paul Warfield||Ohio State||WR||1970\u20131974||1983|\n|39||Larry Csonka||Syracuse||FB||1968\u20131974, 1979||1987|\n|62||Jim Langer||South Dakota State||C||1970\u20131979||1987|\n|12||Bob Griese||Purdue||QB||1967\u20131980||1990|\n|66||Larry Little||Bethune-Cookman||G||1969\u20131980||1993|\n|57||Dwight Stephenson||Alabama||C||1980\u20131987||1998|\n|85||Nick Buoniconti||Notre Dame||LB||1969\u20131974, 1976||2001|\n|13||Dan Marino||Pittsburgh||QB||1983\u20131999||2005|\n|99||Jason Taylor||Akron||DE||1997\u20132007, 2009, 2011||2017|\n|54||Zach Thomas||Texas Tech||LB||1996\u20132007||2023|\n|Coaches and Executives|\n|Name||College||Position||Season(s)||Inducted|\n|Don Shula||John Carroll||Head coach||1970\u20131995||1997|\n|Miami Dolphins Hall of Famers who were inducted for other teams|\n|Players|\n|No.||Name||College||Position(s)||Season(s)||Inducted|\n|34||Thurman Thomas||Oklahoma State||RB||2000||2007|\n|88||Cris Carter||Ohio State||WR||2002||2013|\n|55||Junior Seau||USC||LB||2003\u20132005||2015|\n|Coaches and executives|\n|Name||College||Position(s)||Season(s)||Inducted|\n|Bill Parcells||Wichita State||Executive VP of Football Operations||2008\u20132010||2013|\n|Bobby Beathard||Cal Poly||Director of Player Personnel||1972\u20131977||2018|\n|Jimmy Johnson||Arkansas||Head coach||1996\u20131999||2020|\n|George Young||Bucknell||Director of Personnel and Pro Scouting||1975\u20131978||2020|\nThe Miami Dolphins currently have three retired jersey numbers:\n- No. 12 for Bob Griese, which was retired on a Monday Night Football broadcast in 1985.\n- No. 13 for Dan Marino, which was retired on September 17, 2000, during halftime of the \"Ravens @ Dolphins\" game on Sunday Night Football .\n- No. 39 for Larry Csonka, which was retired on December 9, 2002 (30th anniversary of Miami's \"1972 Undefeated Team\"), during halftime of the \"Bears @ Dolphins\" game on Monday Night Football .\nMiami Dolphins retired numbers\nListed below are the individuals who have won the following NFL, Super Bowl, and Pro Bowl MVP awards, the Offensive and Defensive Rookie and Player of the Year awards, the Comeback Player of the Year winners, the winners of the prestigious NFL Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, and the winner of the Coach of the Year Award for the Miami Dolphins.

The Dolphins compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The team plays its home games at Hard Rock Stadium , located in the northern suburb of Miami Gardens, Florida . The team is currently owned by Stephen M. Ross . The Dolphins are the oldest professional sports team in Florida. Of the four AFC East teams, the Dolphins are the only team in the division that was not a charter member of the American Football League (AFL). The Dolphins were also one of the first professional football teams in the southeast, along with the Atlanta Falcons . The Dolphins were founded by attorney-politician Joe Robbie and actor-comedian Danny Thomas . They began play in the AFL in 1966 . The region had not had a professional football team since the days of the Miami Seahawks , who played in the All-America Football Conference in 1946, before becoming the first incarnation of the Baltimore Colts . For the first few years, the Dolphins' full-time training camp and practice facilities were at Saint Andrew's School , a private, boys boarding prep school in Boca Raton. Miami joined the NFL as a result of the 1970 AFL\u2013NFL merger . The team played in its first Super Bowl in Super Bowl VI , losing to the Dallas Cowboys , 24\u20133. The following year , the Dolphins completed the NFL's only perfect season , culminating in a Super Bowl win, winning all 14 of their regular-season games, and all three of their playoff games, including Super Bowl VII . They were the third NFL team to accomplish a perfect regular season , and remain the only team to do so since the AFL-NFL merger, the time known as the Super Bowl era. The next year, the Dolphins won Super Bowl VIII , becoming the first team to appear in three consecutive Super Bowls, and the second team (the first AFL/AFC team) to win back-to-back championships. Miami also appeared in Super Bowl XVII and Super Bowl XIX , losing both games. For most of their early history, the Dolphins were coached by Don Shula , the most successful head coach in professional football history in terms of total games won. Under Shula, the Dolphins posted losing records in only two of his 26 seasons as the head coach. During the period spanning 1983 to the end of 1999, quarterback Dan Marino became one of the most prolific passers in NFL history, breaking numerous league passing records. Marino led the Dolphins to five division titles, 10 playoff appearances, and an appearance in Super Bowl XIX before retiring following the 1999 season . Since Marino's retirement, they have experienced mediocre levels of success and have just five playoff appearances ( 2000 , 2001 , 2008 , 2016 , and 2022 ) and two division titles ( 2000 and 2008 ). The Miami Dolphins joined the American Football League (AFL) when an expansion franchise was awarded to lawyer Joseph Robbie and actor Danny Thomas in 1965 for $7.5 million, although Thomas would eventually sell his stake in the team to Robbie. [7] During the summer of 1966, the Dolphins' training camp was in St. Pete Beach with practices in August at Boca Ciega High School in Gulfport . [8] The Dolphins were the worst team with a 15\u201339\u20132 record in their first four seasons under head coach George Wilson , before Don Shula was hired as head coach. Shula was a Paul Brown disciple who had been lured from the Baltimore Colts , after losing Super Bowl III two seasons earlier to the AFL's New York Jets , and finishing 8\u20135\u20131 the following season. Shula got his first NFL coaching job from then-Detroit head coach George Wilson, who hired him as the defensive coordinator. The AFL merged with the NFL in 1970, and the Dolphins were assigned to the AFC East division in the NFL's new American Football Conference . For the rest of the 20th century, the Shula-led Dolphins emerged as one of the most dominant teams in the NFL, with only two losing seasons between 1970 and 1999. They were extremely successful in the 1970s, completing the first complete perfect season in NFL history by finishing with a 14\u20130 regular-season record in 1972 and winning the Super Bowl that year . It was the first of two consecutive Super Bowl wins and one of three appearances in a row. The 1980s and 1990s were also moderately successful. The early 80s teams made two Super Bowls despite losing both times and saw the emergence of future Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino , who went on to break numerous NFL passing records, holding many of them until the late 2000s. After winning every game against the division rival Buffalo Bills in the 1970s, the two teams gradually developed a competitive rivalry in the 80s and 90s, often competing for AFC supremacy when Jim Kelly emerged as the quarterback for the Bills. The Dolphins have also maintained a strong rivalry with the New York Jets throughout much of their history. Following the retirements of Marino and Shula and the rise of Tom Brady and the New England Patriots , the Dolphins suffered a decline in the 2000s and 2010s. During this period, the team's level of play was largely described as mediocre. [9] [10] [11] They have only made the playoffs four times since Marino's retirement and have largely been unable to find a consistent quarterback to replace him. The team suffered a franchise-worst 1\u201315 season in 2007 . They rebounded the following season , becoming the first team in NFL history to win their division and make a playoff appearance following a league-worst season . [ citation needed ] That same season, the Dolphins upset the New England Patriots on the road during Week 3 thanks to the use of the gimmick Wildcat offense , which handed the Patriots their first regular-season loss since December 10, 2006, in which coincidentally, they were also beaten by the Dolphins. However, this success in 2008 proved to be an outlier during this period in the franchise's history; to date, it is the last season the Dolphins won the AFC East. [12] However, the Dolphins have been competitive against the Patriots despite their decline, with notable wins coming in 2004, 2008, 2014, 2018 , and 2019. Until 2020, they were also the last team in the AFC East to win the division championship aside from the Patriots, doing so in 2008.

The rivalry was extremely lopsided in favor of Miami during the 1970s, as the Dolphins won all 20 games against the Bills during that decade. Fortunes changed in the 1980s and 1990s when Jim Kelly became the Bills' starting quarterback. Though both teams were extremely dominant during that period, the Bills ultimately held the edge and dominated the Dolphins during their four playoff matchups in the 1990s, with the Dolphins' only playoff win coming after Kelly's retirement. With the rise of Tom Brady and the Patriots during the 2000s and the retirements of Kelly and Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino , the Bills-Dolphins rivalry faded in relevance, but remains somewhat intense to this day. Some former Dolphins have gone to play for the Bills as well, most notably Dan Carpenter , Chris Hogan , and Charles Clay . In the 2020s, the rivalry sharpened, with Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa , drafted in 2020, leading a resurgent Dolphins team against the Josh Allen -led Bills, who had gained a streak of success after Brady's departure from the Patriots and the division. Though Allen's career record against Miami currently stands at 9\u20132, Tagovailoa led the Dolphins to their first win over Bills in 8 games in 2022, and the Dolphins played the Bills tightly in the teams' two other meetings that year despite losing both, including the playoffs. Main article: Dolphins\u2013Patriots rivalry The Dolphins dominated the New England Patriots during the 1970s and the 1990s, but there were some notable moments as well, including a 1982 game now known as the Snowplow Game . Fortunes changed when Tom Brady became the franchise quarterback for the Patriots, and during his tenure with the Patriots , New England dominated the AFC, especially the AFC East, winning 16 of 17 division titles between 2003 and 2019, with the Dolphins winning the only non-Patriots division title in that time frame when Brady was out due to injury. Miami posed the biggest divisional challenge to the Brady-led Patriots, however, winning more games against them than the Bills or Jets did during that era. [13] [14] Notable wins over New England by the Dolphins include the Miracle in Miami , which involved a dramatic last-minute game-winning touchdown that paralleled \"The Night that Courage Wore Orange\", where in 2004 , the Dolphins, at 2\u201311, upset the defending Super Bowl champion Patriots 28\u201329, and handed them the second of their 2 losses that season. [15] The rivalry briefly intensified in 2005 when Nick Saban , Bill Belichick 's former Browns defensive coordinator was hired as their new head coach and when Saban nearly signed quarterback Drew Brees , as well as in 2008, when the two teams battled for the AFC East division title. Miami and New England are also the only two franchises to have posted undefeated regular-season records since the NFL-AFL merger, with Miami going 14\u20130 in 1972 and New England going 16\u20130 in 2007 , but only the 1972 Dolphins were able to win the Super Bowl. Main article: Dolphins\u2013Jets rivalry The New York Jets are perhaps Miami's most bitter rivals. [16] Dolphins fans despise the Jets due to the sheer amount of New York City transplants who have moved to South Florida and the Jets' usual cocky demeanor. Just as the Bills-Dolphins rivalry is motivated by differences, the Dolphins-Jets series is also notable for the differences between New York and Miami. Unlike the former, this rivalry has been more consistent over the years. Some of the more memorable moments in this rivalry include Dan Marino 's fake spike , Vinny Testaverde leading the Jets to a notable comeback on Monday Night Football , and former Jets quarterback Chad Pennington signing with the Dolphins and leading them to a divisional title. The two teams have also played in the 1982 AFC Championship , with Miami winning to face the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XVII . Main article: Buccaneers\u2013Dolphins rivalry Since the founding of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1976, the Dolphins and Buccaneers have shared a mellow in-state rivalry and were the only two teams in Florida until the Jacksonville Jaguars joined the NFL in 1995. When the then- Baltimore Colts were inserted into the AFC East following the AFL/NFL merger, they sparked a heated rivalry with the Dolphins, as a controversy involving the hiring of former Colts coach Don Shula forced Miami to forfeit a first-round draft pick. The Dolphins and Colts faced off several times in the AFC playoffs during the 1970s, including the AFC championship game leading up to Super Bowl VI , which the Dolphins lost to the Dallas Cowboys . The rivalry cooled down in the 1980s after the Colts struggled and moved to Indianapolis , but heated up once again in the late 90s until the Colts were reassigned into the AFC South as a result of the 2002 realignment of the NFL's divisions. [17] The Dolphins also share historic rivalries with other AFC teams such as the Las Vegas Raiders , Los Angeles Chargers , and Pittsburgh Steelers , stemming from often competing against these teams in the playoffs during the Don Shula era, and to a lesser extent, the Jacksonville Jaguars , who also represent the state of Florida. [17] The Dolphins originally played all home games in the Orange Bowl in Miami. They moved to the new Joe Robbie Stadium after the 1986 season. From 1993 to 2011, the Dolphins shared the stadium with Major League Baseball 's Florida Marlins (now known as the Miami Marlins). The venue has had multiple naming rights deals since 1996 , carrying the names Pro Player Stadium, Dolphins Stadium, Dolphin Stadium, LandShark Stadium, Sun Life Stadium, New Miami Stadium and, as of August 2016, Hard Rock Stadium . The facility is located in Miami Gardens , a suburb of Miami located approximately 15 miles (24 km) north of downtown Miami. The Miami Dolphins share Hard Rock Stadium with the NCAA Miami Hurricanes . The 2015\u20132016 season was the first season in the newly renovated Hard Rock Stadium. The Dolphins spent more than two years and over $400 million on a major overhaul to Hard Rock Stadium. Every seat was replaced and the lower-level seats were moved closer to the field. There are roughly 10,000 fewer seats. [18] St. Petersburg Beach hosted the Dolphins' first training camp in 1966. St. Andrew's School in Boca Raton hosted training camp in the late 1960s. The Dolphins subsequently trained in Miami Gardens at Biscayne College, later renamed St. Thomas University , from 1970 until 1993. In 1993, the Dolphins opened the Miami Dolphins Training Facility at Nova Southeastern University in Davie . In 2006, the facility added a domed field that allows the team to practice during thunderstorms which are common in the area during the summer. [19] In 2021, the Dolphins opened a new, 135 million training facility, dubbed the Baptist Health Training Complex, the Dolphins will practice in. The complex is located next to Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens. The Dolphins logo and uniforms remained fairly consistent from the team's founding through 2012. The team's colors were originally aqua and coral , with the coral color paying tribute to the Miami Seahawks and to the many natural coral reefs in Biscayne Bay. The team's original logo consisted of a sunburst with a leaping dolphin wearing a football helmet bearing the letter M. At their debut in 1966, a lighter & brighter orange was used instead of the deep coral color. The dolphin's head was near the center of the sunburst. In the 1967 season, the dolphin was centered on the sunburst, but it reverted to the original placement between 1968 and 1973. By 1974, the dolphin's body was centered on the sunburst in a slightly smaller logo than the 1967 version. The uniforms featured white pants with aqua and orange stripes, paired with either a white or aqua jersey. On the white jersey, aqua block numbers and names were outlined in orange, with aqua and orange sleeve stripes. Starting with the 1972 perfect season, these uniforms were used as the primary uniforms for road games and daytime home games, due to the extreme heat of South Florida. The team also had an aqua jersey used mainly for night home games or road games in which the opponent chose to wear white. The aqua jersey featured white block numbers and names with an orange outline, and orange and white sleeve stripes. An update was given to the logo in 1997 \u2013 the sunburst was simplified and the dolphin was darkened and given a more serious game-face expression. [20] The uniforms remained the same; however, a different block number font was used and navy drop shadows were added. On very rare occasions, an orange jersey was used for primetime games. The uniforms essentially swapped the location of orange and aqua from the aqua jersey. The orange jersey was first used on a Sunday night in 2003 against Washington , a Dolphin win. In 2004, the orange jersey was brought back for an Monday Night Football match pitting the 2\u201311 Dolphins against the 12\u20131 defending champion New England Patriots . The Dolphins scored a huge upset win after trailing by 11 points with less than 5 minutes remaining. Due to the unusual orange jerseys, the game has become known within some Dolphin circles as \" The Night That Courage Wore Orange \". [21] The orange jerseys were used for a 2009 Monday night win against the New York Jets . However, the Dolphins would lose a 2010 Sunday night matchup with the Jets, their first loss in orange, and the orange jerseys in the original style would not be worn again. In 2009, the Dolphins switched to black shoes for the first time since the early 1970s glory days, following a recent trend among NFL teams. However, by 2011, they returned to wearing white shoes. The Dolphins' final game in the original style uniforms with block numbers and the iconic leaping dolphin logo was the final game of the 2012 season, a 28\u20130 shutout loss to the New England Patriots in Foxboro . The white jerseys were worn for the game, and as rumors of a new look had been swirling, many fans watching knew that it would likely be the last time their team would wear the leaping dolphin logo. A radically new logo and new uniforms were unveiled shortly before the 2013 NFL Draft . [22] [23] [24] The new logo features a stylized aqua dolphin swimming in front of a heavily modified version of the orange sunburst. The dolphin in the logo is more vague and artistic, and is not wearing a helmet as it is merely a silhouette of a dolphin cast in aqua and navy. Navy was incorporated as featured color for the first time, with orange becoming greatly de-emphasized. The uniforms feature both white pants and aqua pants, with a white or aqua jersey. The Dolphins continue to wear white at home, just as they had with the previous uniforms, with aqua being used for primetime home games. The white jersey features aqua numbers and names in a unique custom font, with orange and navy outlines on the numbers; however, the names only use navy as an outline color. The aqua jerseys use white numbers with an orange and aqua outline, and white names with a navy outline. The helmets are white with a white facemask, just like the final years of the previous look; however, navy is a prominent color on the helmet stripe, joining aqua and a de-emphasized orange. Both jerseys have large \"Dolphins\" text above the numbers, written in the team's new script. The pants are either aqua or white, and contain no markings other than a small team wordmark. [25] In 2018, the team made some slight modifications to the logo and uniform set: The shades of orange and aqua were tweaked, and navy blue was removed from the color scheme, only remaining on the logo. [26] In 2015, the Dolphins brought back their 1970s aqua uniforms for a few select games. Four years later, they brought back a white version from the same era as a second alternate uniform. The aqua throwbacks were worn during the now-famous 2018 Miracle in Miami play against the Patriots. On September 29, 2016, the Dolphins debuted their new Color Rush uniform in a Thursday Night Football game against the Cincinnati Bengals . The all-orange uniform marked the first time since 2010 that the Dolphins wore an orange uniform. However, the set was only used for that game as the Dolphins immediately retired the uniform soon after. In later years, the Dolphins wore similar all-aqua or all-white uniforms in select games as the NFL gradually relaxed its rules regarding hosiery. The song was written and composed by Lee Ofman, and has similar instrumentation and lyrics to the fight song of the Houston Oilers . Ofman approached the Dolphins with it before the 1972 season because he wanted music to inspire his favorite team. The fight song would soon serve as a good luck charm for the Dolphins that season. The Dolphins became the first team in NFL history to record an undefeated season, going 17\u20130 en route to victory over the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl VII . The following season, Miami posted an equally impressive 15\u20132 record and capped the season with another title, defeating the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl VIII . The back-to-back championship runs, coupled with the popularity of the fight song amongst Dolphins fans, have ensured the song's longevity. The Dolphins revealed a new fight song by T-Pain and Jimmy Buffett featuring Pitbull on August 7, 2009, which was introduced for the 2009 NFL season. [27] The fight song was played during the preseason home opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars on August 17, 2009, but was not played during the second preseason game against the Carolina Panthers on August 22, 2009, after being booed heavily in the first game. Furthermore, the team has preferred to play Buffett's song \" Fins \" after scores during the 2009 regular season instead of the traditional fight song. The team's cheerleaders are known collectively as the Miami Dolphins Cheerleaders. [28] The company had its debut in 1978 as the Dolphins Starbrites. (The name referred to the co-sponsor, Starbrite Car Polish.) The cheerleaders' founding choreographer was June Taylor , famed colleague of Jackie Gleason , who led the squad until her retirement in 1990. In April 2010, the Dolphins started the first Volunteer Program in the NFL. Special Teams is a unique volunteer organization created to enlist and mobilize the ongoing services of the community with the Dolphins staff, players and alumni. The mission of the Special Teams is to offer hands-on services to communities and families in need, to partner with existing organizations on worthwhile social, civic and charitable programs, to provide assistance at Miami Dolphins Foundation events, and to support community efforts in times of emergency. This program is headed by Leslie Nixon and Sergio Xiques. Since its inception, Special Teams has given over 250,000 community services hours to the South Florida and Mexico community. [29] (\"The Dolphin\") On Friday, April 18, 1997, the first \"official\" mascot of the Miami Dolphins was introduced. The 7-foot mascot made his public debut on April 19 at Pro Player Stadium during the team's draft-day party. The team then made a \"Name the Mascot\" contest that drew over 13,000 entries covering all 50 states and 22 countries. 529 names were suggested. The winning entry was announced at the annual Dolphins Awards Banquet on June 4, 1997. Denny Sym cheered on the Miami Dolphins for 33 years as a one-man sideline show, leading Miami crowds in cheers and chants in his glittering coral (orange) and aqua hat from the Dolphins\u2019 first game in 1966 until 2000. Sym died on March 18, 2007. He was 72. [30] Main article: Flipper From 1966 to 1968, and in the 1970s a live dolphin was situated in a water tank in the open (east) end of the Orange Bowl. He would jump in the tank to celebrate touchdowns and field goals. The tank that was set up in the 1970s was manufactured by Evan Bush and maintained during the games by Evan Bush and Dene Whitaker. Flipper was removed from the Orange Bowl after 1968 to save costs, and in the 1970s due to stress. In August 2010, the team launched its own regional TV \"network\". The Dolphins Television Network comprises 10 South Florida TV stations that agreed to carry the team-produced coverage. [31] Preseason games are broadcast on television through WFOR-TV in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, WTVX in West Palm Beach, WBBH-TV in Fort Myers, and WRDQ in Orlando. Longtime TV and radio personality Dick Stockton provides play-by-play commentary, with Dolphins Hall-of-Fame QB Bob Griese and former Dolphins WR Nat Moore providing color commentary. The radio broadcast team features Jimmy Cefalo providing play-by-play commentary and Joe Rose providing color commentary during preseason games, along with Griese for regular-season games. [32] Griese replaced longtime color commentator Jim Mandich , who played for the Dolphins under Don Shula. Mandich lost his fight with cancer in 2011, opening the door for Griese as his replacement. Radio coverage as of the 2023 season will be provided by WINZ (940 AM) and WBGG-FM (105.9 FM). Additionally, games can also be heard in Spanish on WNMA (1210 AM), with Ra\u00fal Striker Jr. and Joaquin Duro providing play-by-play and color commentary, respectively. CBS-owned WFOR, in addition to preseason telecasts, airs most of the Dolphins' regular season games. If the team hosts an interconference opponent or plays on a Thursday night, WSVN , the local Fox affiliate will have the games being televised. When playing on Sunday night, the team's matches will be broadcast on WTVJ , the NBC O&O station. The Dolphins' radio affiliates: [33] [34] The Dolphins currently have ten players, and one coach enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame , that have spent the majority (or entirety) of their careers, or made significant contributions with the Miami Dolphins. Three other players and four contributors that have spent only a \"minor portion\" of their careers with the Dolphins, and have been enshrined primarily with other teams, have also been enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

Stroud second overall, the Texans traded up nine slots, from 12 to three in the first round, to take Alabama defensive end Will Anderson . Houston GM Nick Caserio traded 12 and 34 this year and first- and third-round picks next year to just barely squeeze the trade into the NFL\u2019s 10-minute window for the third pick. As I explain in the next item about Arizona\u2019s draft, Houston could be picking very early next year\u2014which will put a white hot spotlight of pressure on Anderson.\nCaserio told me at NRG Stadium that Stroud was clearly the team\u2019s target at two. He\u2019d had some discussions with Cards GM Monti Ossenfort about possibly moving from 12 to three. \u201cThen,\u201d Caserio said, \u201cit happened pretty quickly when they were on the clock.\u201d\nThe deal got done and all parties notified, he said, with \u201cclose to a minute\u201d left. So the Texans got a player they hope will be their franchise QB, and they got the best defensive player on their board. That is one heck of a night\u2019s work. The price, of course, is denuding the 2024 draft when the Texans might wish they had two first-round picks and four in the first three rounds\u2014instead of now just one first-round pick, one second- and no thirds.\nBut \u2013 and there is a big but \u2013 you should have been at the Texans\u2019 facility in the basement of NRG Stadium late Friday afternoon, when Stroud and Anderson put on a show of humility and team-firstness that had to make Texans fans so weary of losing (a league-worst 11-38-1 in the last three years) happy for the first time since the Wild Card win over Buffalo three years ago.\nStroud and Anderson came with their families and made it clear they were all-in on going to a losing team after years of nothing but winning in college. Afterward, Stroud told me: \u201cThat\u2019s what life is about, working to build something good. That\u2019s what I\u2019m here to help this team do. I\u2019m ready for it.\u201d\nThe Texans have asked Stroud to let the S-2 Test controversy go, but he got a couple last licks in on it. A player who played the way Stroud did\u2014particularly in putting up 41 points in his superb final college game in the playoff against Georgia\u2014is not a player who can\u2019t process, or can\u2019t ID a defense. I understand using every tool in the bag to analyze players before the draft, and I\u2019d check out why Stroud scored low on the test. But to think it\u2019s a good indicator of future failure\u2014I mean, watch the games he\u2019s played.\nWe stood in a hallway just off the Texans\u2019 locker room for 12 minutes and I asked him about what he\u2019s learned from the last three months.\n\u201cHumility is something I\u2019m not afraid of,\u201d Stroud said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019m accustomed to. This was all probably just a humble moment God wanted me to go through.\n\u201c A lot of people haven\u2019t played the sport, and I mean critics are gonna critique. For me I know the film speaks for itself. Everything that I\u2019ve done in college, I\u2019ve been very consistent. I think I\u2019ve been one of the most consistent players in college football for the last two years. If you turn on the tape, you can see, you can answer the questions. But those who don\u2019t understand tape might want to go to other things and analyze other things. They\u2019re more than welcome to do such. But the people who are making the choices and the picks, they knew what I can do. They understood the IQ that I do have.\n\u201cI have a great memory when it comes to football,\u201d Stroud added. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s different ways to be geniuses. You don\u2019t just have to be book smart. You can be analytics smart. You can be numbers smart. You can be football smart. I really think that there\u2019s different types of ways to be smart. That\u2019s something that I pride myself on. And I am book smart. I did have over a 3.0 in college. I had over a 3.0 in high school. I know that I can think. I can process very, very fast. The film, you can see me going from first option to second and then back to one and then to three to four if I have to. I can check down. I can use my feet.\n\u201cBut, you know, everything happens for a reason. I\u2019m not upset. I\u2019m actually blessed, I\u2019m super blessed to be a Texan. Number two overall pick in the NFL draft, man. A little kid from the [California] Inland Empire. All smiles, man. I ain\u2019t tripping about this.\u201d\nGood attitude to have. But at the same time, I could feel it: C.J. Stroud will remember this pre-draft process. And for the Texans, that bit of motivation will be a very good thing.\nHENDERSON, Nev.\u2014Just before noon on Thursday, hours before the start of the NFL Draft, Raiders coach Josh McDaniels popped into GM Dave Ziegler \u2019s office for one last bit of strategy talk. The team\u2019s draft board had been set with finality Wednesday, after three months of debate. The Raiders, after conversations with teams above them about trading up from number seven in the first round, decided to stay in their slot, barring a surprise.\n\u201cWhat we need is for three quarterbacks to go before we pick,\u201d McDaniels said.\nIt seemed logical, with Carolina going Bryce Young at number one and then Houston at two and Indianapolis at four and Seattle at five all in the QB market. But nothing in this draft after Carolina was a sure thing. All McDaniels and Ziegler knew was that these four non-QBs sat at the top of their board a short spiral away, graded closely:\nBut as Ziegler and McDaniels hashed it out, and McDaniels talked about the latest intel he\u2019d heard about the top six (\u201cI hope I\u2019ll have something coming in on Houston at two, but Nick\u2019s tight,\u201d he said, referring to Texans GM/CIA agent Nick Caserio ), they realized they were just like the rest of America: They doubted Houston would pick a quarterback at two, they didn\u2019t know which GM was fixing to pay a ransom to trade up with Arizona at three, they didn\u2019t know which quarterback Indianapolis would choose at four, and they didn\u2019t know if Seattle would go QB or best defensive weapon at five.\nNo surprise, all this mystery. This is the modern draft, where lips are no longer loose, where mock drafts are a mockery of reality. It sounds counterintuitive, but in the hours before the NFL Draft, the people running drafts for $6 billion franchises didn\u2019t know much more than the rest of us. Ziegler and McDaniels did know by staying put\u2014and they would get a phone call that surprised and tempted them minutes before their pick\u2014they were not in control of their fate. They needed help. The Raiders needed two teams post-Carolina to pick passers in the next five picks. Likely. Not certain.\nAt 4:43 p.m. Pacific Time, Ziegler was on his way into the draft room, a large square conference room on the third floor of the Raiders\u2019 facility six miles west of the Vegas Strip. He stopped by the floor-to-ceiling photograph of the man who lords over this franchise 12 years after his death, and Ziegler patted the photograph of Al Davis .\n\u201cGoosebumps,\u201d Ziegler said. \u201cI feel his presence every day.\u201d\nThen Ziegler\u201447, in gray suit, black Oxford shirt, no tie, white and black sneakers\u2014entered the draft room, where 13 scouts, personnel people, one coach and one owner would plot the immediate future of Al Davis\u2019 team. At 4:59 p.m., 11 minutes before the draft kicked off, owner Mark Davis slipped into the room, in his white satin Raiders jacket and stonewashed faded jeans.\n\u201cGameday, baby!\u201d Son of Al announced to the room.\nGameday, as Mark Davis said. \u201cWe\u2019re still undefeated!\u201d Davis said as Roger Goodell kicked off the draft. One wall taken up entirely with the draft board, ranking the players by position from top to bottom, on magnetic cards, the old-school way. One wall, controlled by pro personnel director Dwayne Joseph , with pick-by-pick order and team-by-team needs that change with every pick. One wall, which McDaniels, Ziegler, assistant GM Champ Kelly and Davis face, with three things: a big TV tuned to the draft, computerized pick-by-pick directly from the league, so it\u2019s faster than what you see on TV, and a constantly updated list of trade discussions with draft-trade charts showing trade proposals broken down by a value chart.\nKelly, Ziegler (cell phone to his ear at least half of the evening), McDaniels, Davis, left to right in front of the room, in swivel chairs, able to look ahead at trade possibilities or back at the state of the draft board. Ziegler flitted from senior personnel adviser Shaun Herock to McDaniels to Davis to Kelly to director of football analytics David Christoff to senior national scouts DuJuan Daniels, Andy Dengler and Lenny McGill , having mostly hushed conversations.\n5:18 p.m. PT: Panthers picked Young. \u201cThis is where the draft starts,\u201d Ziegler, stating the obvious, said.\nFour minutes later, the tinny voice from draft headquarters said, \u201cHouston has made its pick. Arizona now on the clock.\u201d All eyes turn to the board where the pick will show up first. C.J. Stroud , QB, Ohio State popped onto the screen. \u201cOooooh,\u201d someone in the room said. Seven minutes passed. Arizona traded down to 12 with Houston. Big compensation: For this pick and a fourth- this year, the Texans gave the Colts the 12 th and 33 rd overall picks this year and their first- and third-round picks next year.\n5:32 p.m.: Will Anderson to Houston at three. One Vegas target down.\n5:33 p.m.: Ziegler on his cell, briefly. Ziegler to McDaniels in a hushed tone: \u201cArizona wants to trade back up.\u201d\nZiegler and McDaniels stared at the trade-value board in the back of the room, analyzing trade possibilities\u2014the values, plus or minus for the Raiders, based on the numerical values Ziegler assigns to each pick:\n1-7 down to 1-12\nPotential Counters\n+177 ARI sends 2-33, LV gives back 4 th (109)\n+68 ARI sends 2-33 and 6-213, LV gives back 3-100 and 4-109\n+30 ARI sends 2-33, LV gives back 3-70\nAt 5:37 p.m., Anthony Richardson , the Florida quarterback, got picked by the Colts. The third quarterback was off the board. McDaniels beamed. He and Ziegler slapped hands. Now the Raiders were sure to get one of their four guys.\n5:42 p.m.: Cards GM Monti Ossenfort called Ziegler. Hushed discussion, presumably exchanging potential offers for the pick. Then Ziegler and McDaniels huddled. Having the 12 th and 33 rd overall picks, to go along with the Raiders\u2019 38 th choice, would be tempting. \u201cWe could get [Oklahoma tackle Anton] Harrison at 12,\u201d McDaniels said. The Raiders loved Harrison\u2014not as much as Johnson, but enough maybe to lose the fourth non-QB they love in order to pick up the 33 rd pick. They mulled.\nThe phone went cold for a few minutes. Seemed obvious Ossenfort wanted Paris Johnson . He had to be dealing with Detroit, trying to get ahead of Vegas to ensure getting Johnson. Smart move by Ossenfort, choosing not to close a deal for the seventh pick and instead dealing for the sixth\u2013ensuring that the Cards would get the tackle they wanted.\n5:47 p.m.: Witherspoon to Seattle at five. Detroit up. No action on Ziegler\u2019s phone. Not surprising. Arizona was targeting Johnson.\n5:50 p.m.: Tinny voice from Draft HQ: \u201cDetroit has traded its pick to Arizona. Arizona is on the clock.\u201d For Vegas, there goes day-one starting right tackle Paris Johnson.\n5:54 p.m. Paris Johnson to Arizona. \u201cLas Vegas is on the clock,\u201d tinny voice says.\nSo no real drama. The plan was preordained. There was no real debate now, no discussion about moving. Only this:\n5:58 p.m.: \u201cTyree, this is coach McDaniels. We\u2019re gonna turn the pick in here, and you\u2019re gonna be a Raider.\u201d\nIn a lull in front of the room, McDaniels said quietly: \u201cOur board was right. We needed three quarterbacks to go, and we\u2019re so happy we got one of the four non-quarterbacks who were our top-rated guys on the board. Look, we gotta rush the passer. We gotta go get [ Patrick] Mahomes and [ Justin] Herbert . That\u2019s four games a year for the next few years against these great young quarterbacks. And the AFC is full of these great young quarterbacks. This is a great outcome for us.\u201d\nThis is the draft. The Raiders needed long-term help opposite Maxx Crosby (edge player Chandler Jones is 33), and Anderson or Wilson would have been great. Witherspoon would have been great to add to a needy secondary. Johnson would have been great to bookend Kolton Miller . It\u2019s capricious. The choice wasn\u2019t up to Ziegler; other teams decided for him. But the vibe in the room, the smiles, showed this staff loves Wilson, even with the foot injury that made him an iffy candidate to some teams.\nIn his office 20 minutes later, McDaniels waited to be connected to Wilson to converse. \u201cI mean, hallelujah,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cHis motivation, his drive, how he handles adversity \u2026 off the charts. We value the TAP test (a test in the pre-draft process that measures mental toughness, drive and composure under pressure), and Tyree got one of the highest grades on it, a Green plus-plus. He\u2019ll fit in great here.\u201d\nMcDaniels\u2019 football ops guy, Tom Jones , walked in with a phone. Wilson. \u201cTyree, welcome to the nation,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cDude, I am so excited you\u2019re a Raider. I know you\u2019re gonna help us win a lot of games. So, just wanted to touch base on a few things. You\u2019re gonna talk to the media here in a bit. Wanted to give you a few points. Be humble, which you are. Stay away from predictions\u2014that way, you won\u2019t have to eat them later. Don\u2019t talk about timelines with your foot. You don\u2019t want your draft story to be all about your foot. Now, you got a fan base that\u2019s second to none. They\u2019re gonna love you. Just express how excited you\u2014which I know you are.\u201d\nBack in the Raiders draft room, after pick 19, Ziegler said, \u201cJosh, you wanna look at trades?\u201d On the board were four players with similar grades: Georgia defensive end Nolan Smith , Maryland corner Deonte Banks , Harrison the Oklahoma tackle, and Arkansas linebacker Drew Sanders . Close to them: Notre Dame tight end Michael Mayer .\nBut there wasn\u2019t much enthusiasm to deal after Banks and Harrison went off the board. Ziegler made a couple of calls about moving up to fill a hole left by the trade of tight end Darren Waller with Mayer, but never got far\u2014or appeared enthusiastic to do it.\n7:36 p.m.: Crosby sent a video message to Wilson, and in the draft room, Ziegler had it and he showed it to McDaniels and Davis on his phone. The tenor of the message: Congrats, Tyree. Now, time to go work, son. \u201cLove it,\u201d McDaniels said.\nThere are lulls in all drafts, and after Banks and Harrison went at 24 and 27, this was the Raider lull. Davis kept things interesting. When the TV showed a crestfallen Will Levis , undrafted, still in the green room in Kansas City, he said: \u201cSomeone should tell him careers are not made on draft day. Tell him this happened to Aaron Rodgers too.\u201d And when he looked up and saw speedy Jalin Hyatt , the wide receiver, still on the board with a high Raider grade, Davis said to McDaniels: \u201cToo bad we don\u2019t have a need at receiver. Can he run?\u201d\n\u201cLike the wind,\u201d McDaniels said.\nDavis started laughing, like he could sense Ziegler and McDaniels did not want him to start lobbying for the best speed receiver in the draft.\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of my DNA,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI see a fast receiver, I want him. I can\u2019t help it.\u201d Spoken like his father\u2019s son.\nAs the round wound down, quietly, I asked Davis what he thought of Ziegler and McDaniels, the ex-Pats, entering year two of their regime. \u201cI like \u2018em,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we hired them, everybody thought we were trying to re-create the Patriots. That wasn\u2019t it. I was trying to find two great football men. Now, this is their chance to build something. They\u2019re young, they love football, and I\u2019m thrilled with them. It\u2019s a huge weekend for them.\n\u201cMy dad\u2019s drafts were different\u2014a lot more tense.\u201d\n\u201cThe tense conversations were already had,\u201d McDaniels said later. \u201cWe had them in the last six weeks. We ended up with the board where we all felt it needed to be.\u201d\n8:30 p.m.: Two picks left, including Kansas City at 31. Mayer on the mind in the draft room. \u201cIf KC comes back to us,\u201d Ziegler said, \u201cwanna do it?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said McDaniels.\n\u201cBest tight end in the draft,\u201d Kelly said.\nShort conversation with KC. \u201cNot gonna work,\u201d Ziegler said. KC would have given 31 and 217 (sixth round) for 38 and 70, a net on the points chart of minus-147. \u201cToo many players we like,\u201d Ziegler said. (Ziegler, on Friday, traded from 38 to 35 with the Colts to snag Mayer, the tight end Vegas wanted above all.)\nAn hour after the round ended, McDaniels and Ziegler unwound in the draft room. Wilson underwent surgery by the top athletic foot surgeon in the field, Dr. Robert Anderson, to repair a fracture last Nov. 21. Six weeks ago, Anderson sent a letter to each team, saying Wilson has responded \u201cextremely well\u201d to surgery. The Raiders expect Wilson to be ready to play this season on schedule. \u201cOur doctors ultimately felt like it was something that we were going to be okay with,\u201d Ziegler said. \u201cIf we wouldn\u2019t have felt comfortable with it, we wouldn\u2019t have [picked Wilson].\u201d\nIn all, the needy Raiders, trying to rebound from a few years of failed top picks, got two likely starters out of the draft\u2014Wilson and Mayer. After that, it\u2019s up in the air, as all drafts are. The Raiders got their presumptive backup to Jimmy Garoppolo , Aidan O\u2019Connell , in the middle of the fourth round\u2014about two rounds earlier than the consensus of where he deserved to go. They got a speed cornerback, Banks\u2019 teammate Jakorian Bennett , with pick 104, and the Raiders hope he plays early.\nMel Kiper, for one, liked the first two picks but the others, not so much. After the top two, Kiper said, \u201cI don\u2019t see value with the rest of this class.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why they play the games. In three years, we\u2019ll see if Ziegler picked right in the NFL\u2019s 88 th draft.", "source_raw_text": "After finishing 9-8 last season, the Miami Dolphins clinched the final AFC Wild Card spot with an 11-6 win over the New York Jets in Week 18 . With new head coach Mike McDaniel leading the charge, the Dolphins hope to win their first Super Bowl since 1973.

HOUSTON\u2014Two big stories here when I landed from Vegas: Drafting a franchise quarterback. Paying franchise-quarterback draft capital to draft a defensive end. There\u2019s no other way to put it: After picking C.J. Stroud second overall, the Texans traded up nine slots, from 12 to three in the first round, to take Alabama defensive end Will Anderson . Houston GM Nick Caserio traded 12 and 34 this year and first- and third-round picks next year to just barely squeeze the trade into the NFL\u2019s 10-minute window for the third pick. As I explain in the next item about Arizona\u2019s draft, Houston could be picking very early next year\u2014which will put a white hot spotlight of pressure on Anderson. Caserio told me at NRG Stadium that Stroud was clearly the team\u2019s target at two. He\u2019d had some discussions with Cards GM Monti Ossenfort about possibly moving from 12 to three. \u201cThen,\u201d Caserio said, \u201cit happened pretty quickly when they were on the clock.\u201d The deal got done and all parties notified, he said, with \u201cclose to a minute\u201d left. So the Texans got a player they hope will be their franchise QB, and they got the best defensive player on their board. That is one heck of a night\u2019s work. The price, of course, is denuding the 2024 draft when the Texans might wish they had two first-round picks and four in the first three rounds\u2014instead of now just one first-round pick, one second- and no thirds. But \u2013 and there is a big but \u2013 you should have been at the Texans\u2019 facility in the basement of NRG Stadium late Friday afternoon, when Stroud and Anderson put on a show of humility and team-firstness that had to make Texans fans so weary of losing (a league-worst 11-38-1 in the last three years) happy for the first time since the Wild Card win over Buffalo three years ago. Stroud and Anderson came with their families and made it clear they were all-in on going to a losing team after years of nothing but winning in college. Afterward, Stroud told me: \u201cThat\u2019s what life is about, working to build something good. That\u2019s what I\u2019m here to help this team do. I\u2019m ready for it.\u201d The Texans have asked Stroud to let the S-2 Test controversy go, but he got a couple last licks in on it. A player who played the way Stroud did\u2014particularly in putting up 41 points in his superb final college game in the playoff against Georgia\u2014is not a player who can\u2019t process, or can\u2019t ID a defense. I understand using every tool in the bag to analyze players before the draft, and I\u2019d check out why Stroud scored low on the test. But to think it\u2019s a good indicator of future failure\u2014I mean, watch the games he\u2019s played. We stood in a hallway just off the Texans\u2019 locker room for 12 minutes and I asked him about what he\u2019s learned from the last three months. \u201cHumility is something I\u2019m not afraid of,\u201d Stroud said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019m accustomed to. This was all probably just a humble moment God wanted me to go through. \u201c A lot of people haven\u2019t played the sport, and I mean critics are gonna critique. For me I know the film speaks for itself. Everything that I\u2019ve done in college, I\u2019ve been very consistent. I think I\u2019ve been one of the most consistent players in college football for the last two years. If you turn on the tape, you can see, you can answer the questions. But those who don\u2019t understand tape might want to go to other things and analyze other things. They\u2019re more than welcome to do such. But the people who are making the choices and the picks, they knew what I can do. They understood the IQ that I do have. \u201cI have a great memory when it comes to football,\u201d Stroud added. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s different ways to be geniuses. You don\u2019t just have to be book smart. You can be analytics smart. You can be numbers smart. You can be football smart. I really think that there\u2019s different types of ways to be smart. That\u2019s something that I pride myself on. And I am book smart. I did have over a 3.0 in college. I had over a 3.0 in high school. I know that I can think. I can process very, very fast. The film, you can see me going from first option to second and then back to one and then to three to four if I have to. I can check down. I can use my feet. \u201cBut, you know, everything happens for a reason. I\u2019m not upset. I\u2019m actually blessed, I\u2019m super blessed to be a Texan. Number two overall pick in the NFL draft, man. A little kid from the [California] Inland Empire. All smiles, man. I ain\u2019t tripping about this.\u201d Good attitude to have. But at the same time, I could feel it: C.J. Stroud will remember this pre-draft process. And for the Texans, that bit of motivation will be a very good thing. HENDERSON, Nev.\u2014Just before noon on Thursday, hours before the start of the NFL Draft, Raiders coach Josh McDaniels popped into GM Dave Ziegler \u2019s office for one last bit of strategy talk. The team\u2019s draft board had been set with finality Wednesday, after three months of debate.

No surprise, all this mystery. This is the modern draft, where lips are no longer loose, where mock drafts are a mockery of reality. It sounds counterintuitive, but in the hours before the NFL Draft, the people running drafts for $6 billion franchises didn\u2019t know much more than the rest of us.

They needed help. The Raiders needed two teams post-Carolina to pick passers in the next five picks. Likely. Not certain. At 4:43 p.m. Pacific Time, Ziegler was on his way into the draft room, a large square conference room on the third floor of the Raiders\u2019 facility six miles west of the Vegas Strip. He stopped by the floor-to-ceiling photograph of the man who lords over this franchise 12 years after his death, and Ziegler patted the photograph of Al Davis . \u201cGoosebumps,\u201d Ziegler said. \u201cI feel his presence every day.\u201d Then Ziegler\u201447, in gray suit, black Oxford shirt, no tie, white and black sneakers\u2014entered the draft room, where 13 scouts, personnel people, one coach and one owner would plot the immediate future of Al Davis\u2019 team. At 4:59 p.m., 11 minutes before the draft kicked off, owner Mark Davis slipped into the room, in his white satin Raiders jacket and stonewashed faded jeans. \u201cGameday, baby!\u201d Son of Al announced to the room. Gameday, as Mark Davis said. \u201cWe\u2019re still undefeated!\u201d Davis said as Roger Goodell kicked off the draft. One wall taken up entirely with the draft board, ranking the players by position from top to bottom, on magnetic cards, the old-school way. One wall, controlled by pro personnel director Dwayne Joseph , with pick-by-pick order and team-by-team needs that change with every pick. One wall, which McDaniels, Ziegler, assistant GM Champ Kelly and Davis face, with three things: a big TV tuned to the draft, computerized pick-by-pick directly from the league, so it\u2019s faster than what you see on TV, and a constantly updated list of trade discussions with draft-trade charts showing trade proposals broken down by a value chart. Kelly, Ziegler (cell phone to his ear at least half of the evening), McDaniels, Davis, left to right in front of the room, in swivel chairs, able to look ahead at trade possibilities or back at the state of the draft board. Ziegler flitted from senior personnel adviser Shaun Herock to McDaniels to Davis to Kelly to director of football analytics David Christoff to senior national scouts DuJuan Daniels, Andy Dengler and Lenny McGill , having mostly hushed conversations. 5:18 p.m. PT: Panthers picked Young. \u201cThis is where the draft starts,\u201d Ziegler, stating the obvious, said. Four minutes later, the tinny voice from draft headquarters said, \u201cHouston has made its pick. Arizona now on the clock.\u201d All eyes turn to the board where the pick will show up first. C.J. Stroud , QB, Ohio State popped onto the screen. \u201cOooooh,\u201d someone in the room said. Seven minutes passed. Arizona traded down to 12 with Houston. Big compensation: For this pick and a fourth- this year, the Texans gave the Colts the 12 th and 33 rd overall picks this year and their first- and third-round picks next year. 5:32 p.m.: Will Anderson to Houston at three. One Vegas target down. 5:33 p.m.: Ziegler on his cell, briefly. Ziegler to McDaniels in a hushed tone: \u201cArizona wants to trade back up.\u201d Ziegler and McDaniels stared at the trade-value board in the back of the room, analyzing trade possibilities\u2014the values, plus or minus for the Raiders, based on the numerical values Ziegler assigns to each pick: 1-7 down to 1-12 Potential Counters +177 ARI sends 2-33, LV gives back 4 th (109) +68 ARI sends 2-33 and 6-213, LV gives back 3-100 and 4-109 +30 ARI sends 2-33, LV gives back 3-70 At 5:37 p.m., Anthony Richardson , the Florida quarterback, got picked by the Colts. The third quarterback was off the board. McDaniels beamed. He and Ziegler slapped hands. Now the Raiders were sure to get one of their four guys. 5:42 p.m.: Cards GM Monti Ossenfort called Ziegler. Hushed discussion, presumably exchanging potential offers for the pick. Then Ziegler and McDaniels huddled. Having the 12 th and 33 rd overall picks, to go along with the Raiders\u2019 38 th choice, would be tempting. \u201cWe could get [Oklahoma tackle Anton] Harrison at 12,\u201d McDaniels said. The Raiders loved Harrison\u2014not as much as Johnson, but enough maybe to lose the fourth non-QB they love in order to pick up the 33 rd pick. They mulled. The phone went cold for a few minutes. Seemed obvious Ossenfort wanted Paris Johnson . He had to be dealing with Detroit, trying to get ahead of Vegas to ensure getting Johnson. Smart move by Ossenfort, choosing not to close a deal for the seventh pick and instead dealing for the sixth\u2013ensuring that the Cards would get the tackle they wanted. 5:47 p.m.: Witherspoon to Seattle at five. Detroit up. No action on Ziegler\u2019s phone. Not surprising. Arizona was targeting Johnson. 5:50 p.m.: Tinny voice from Draft HQ: \u201cDetroit has traded its pick to Arizona. Arizona is on the clock.\u201d For Vegas, there goes day-one starting right tackle Paris Johnson. 5:54 p.m. Paris Johnson to Arizona. \u201cLas Vegas is on the clock,\u201d tinny voice says. So no real drama. The plan was preordained. There was no real debate now, no discussion about moving. Only this: 5:58 p.m.: \u201cTyree, this is coach McDaniels. We\u2019re gonna turn the pick in here, and you\u2019re gonna be a Raider.\u201d In a lull in front of the room, McDaniels said quietly: \u201cOur board was right. We needed three quarterbacks to go, and we\u2019re so happy we got one of the four non-quarterbacks who were our top-rated guys on the board. Look, we gotta rush the passer. We gotta go get [ Patrick] Mahomes and [ Justin] Herbert . That\u2019s four games a year for the next few years against these great young quarterbacks. And the AFC is full of these great young quarterbacks. This is a great outcome for us.\u201d This is the draft. The Raiders needed long-term help opposite Maxx Crosby (edge player Chandler Jones is 33), and Anderson or Wilson would have been great. Witherspoon would have been great to add to a needy secondary. Johnson would have been great to bookend Kolton Miller . It\u2019s capricious. The choice wasn\u2019t up to Ziegler; other teams decided for him. But the vibe in the room, the smiles, showed this staff loves Wilson, even with the foot injury that made him an iffy candidate to some teams. In his office 20 minutes later, McDaniels waited to be connected to Wilson to converse. \u201cI mean, hallelujah,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cHis motivation, his drive, how he handles adversity \u2026 off the charts. We value the TAP test (a test in the pre-draft process that measures mental toughness, drive and composure under pressure), and Tyree got one of the highest grades on it, a Green plus-plus. He\u2019ll fit in great here.\u201d McDaniels\u2019 football ops guy, Tom Jones , walked in with a phone. Wilson. \u201cTyree, welcome to the nation,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cDude, I am so excited you\u2019re a Raider. I know you\u2019re gonna help us win a lot of games. So, just wanted to touch base on a few things. You\u2019re gonna talk to the media here in a bit. Wanted to give you a few points. Be humble, which you are. Stay away from predictions\u2014that way, you won\u2019t have to eat them later. Don\u2019t talk about timelines with your foot. You don\u2019t want your draft story to be all about your foot. Now, you got a fan base that\u2019s second to none. They\u2019re gonna love you. Just express how excited you\u2014which I know you are.\u201d Back in the Raiders draft room, after pick 19, Ziegler said, \u201cJosh, you wanna look at trades?\u201d On the board were four players with similar grades: Georgia defensive end Nolan Smith , Maryland corner Deonte Banks , Harrison the Oklahoma tackle, and Arkansas linebacker Drew Sanders . Close to them: Notre Dame tight end Michael Mayer . But there wasn\u2019t much enthusiasm to deal after Banks and Harrison went off the board. Ziegler made a couple of calls about moving up to fill a hole left by the trade of tight end Darren Waller with Mayer, but never got far\u2014or appeared enthusiastic to do it. 7:36 p.m.: Crosby sent a video message to Wilson, and in the draft room, Ziegler had it and he showed it to McDaniels and Davis on his phone. The tenor of the message: Congrats, Tyree. Now, time to go work, son. \u201cLove it,\u201d McDaniels said. There are lulls in all drafts, and after Banks and Harrison went at 24 and 27, this was the Raider lull. Davis kept things interesting. When the TV showed a crestfallen Will Levis , undrafted, still in the green room in Kansas City, he said: \u201cSomeone should tell him careers are not made on draft day. Tell him this happened to Aaron Rodgers too.\u201d And when he looked up and saw speedy Jalin Hyatt , the wide receiver, still on the board with a high Raider grade, Davis said to McDaniels: \u201cToo bad we don\u2019t have a need at receiver. Can he run?\u201d \u201cLike the wind,\u201d McDaniels said. Davis started laughing, like he could sense Ziegler and McDaniels did not want him to start lobbying for the best speed receiver in the draft. \u201cIt\u2019s part of my DNA,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI see a fast receiver, I want him. I can\u2019t help it.\u201d Spoken like his father\u2019s son. As the round wound down, quietly, I asked Davis what he thought of Ziegler and McDaniels, the ex-Pats, entering year two of their regime. \u201cI like \u2018em,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we hired them, everybody thought we were trying to re-create the Patriots. That wasn\u2019t it. I was trying to find two great football men. Now, this is their chance to build something. They\u2019re young, they love football, and I\u2019m thrilled with them. It\u2019s a huge weekend for them. \u201cMy dad\u2019s drafts were different\u2014a lot more tense.\u201d \u201cThe tense conversations were already had,\u201d McDaniels said later. \u201cWe had them in the last six weeks. We ended up with the board where we all felt it needed to be.\u201d 8:30 p.m.: Two picks left, including Kansas City at 31. Mayer on the mind in the draft room. \u201cIf KC comes back to us,\u201d Ziegler said, \u201cwanna do it?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said McDaniels. \u201cBest tight end in the draft,\u201d Kelly said. Short conversation with KC. \u201cNot gonna work,\u201d Ziegler said. KC would have given 31 and 217 (sixth round) for 38 and 70, a net on the points chart of minus-147. \u201cToo many players we like,\u201d Ziegler said. (Ziegler, on Friday, traded from 38 to 35 with the Colts to snag Mayer, the tight end Vegas wanted above all.) An hour after the round ended, McDaniels and Ziegler unwound in the draft room. Wilson underwent surgery by the top athletic foot surgeon in the field, Dr. Robert Anderson, to repair a fracture last Nov. 21. Six weeks ago, Anderson sent a letter to each team, saying Wilson has responded \u201cextremely well\u201d to surgery. The Raiders expect Wilson to be ready to play this season on schedule. \u201cOur doctors ultimately felt like it was something that we were going to be okay with,\u201d Ziegler said. \u201cIf we wouldn\u2019t have felt comfortable with it, we wouldn\u2019t have [picked Wilson].\u201d In all, the needy Raiders, trying to rebound from a few years of failed top picks, got two likely starters out of the draft\u2014Wilson and Mayer. After that, it\u2019s up in the air, as all drafts are. The Raiders got their presumptive backup to Jimmy Garoppolo , Aidan O\u2019Connell , in the middle of the fourth round\u2014about two rounds earlier than the consensus of where he deserved to go. They got a speed cornerback, Banks\u2019 teammate Jakorian Bennett , with pick 104, and the Raiders hope he plays early. Mel Kiper, for one, liked the first two picks but the others, not so much. After the top two, Kiper said, \u201cI don\u2019t see value with the rest of this class.\u201d That\u2019s why they play the games. In three years, we\u2019ll see if Ziegler picked right in the NFL\u2019s 88 th draft.", "documentFile":

Today, we dive deep into the Dolphins\u2019 postseason chronicles. *We\u2019ll only consider appearances from the 1970 merger onward.  2016  Wild Card: Lost 12-30 @ Steelers Wild Card: Lost 12-30 @ Steelers  2008  Wild Card: Lost 9-27 vs. Ravens Wild Card: Lost 9-27 vs. Ravens  2001  Wild Card: Lost 3-20 vs. Ravens Wild Card: Lost 3-20 vs. Ravens  2000  Wild Card: Won 23-17 (OT) vs. Colts Divisional Round: Lost 0-27 @ Raiders Wild Card: Won 23-17 (OT) vs. Colts Divisional Round: Lost 0-27 @ Raiders  1999  Wild Card: Won 20-17 @ Seahawks Divisional Round: Lost 7-62 @ Jaguars Wild Card: Won 20-17 @ Seahawks Divisional Round: Lost 7-62 @ Jaguars  1998  Wild Card: Won 24-17 vs. Bills Divisional Round: Lost 3-38 @ Broncos Wild Card: Won 24-17 vs. Bills Divisional Round: Lost 3-38 @ Broncos  1997  Wild Card: Lost 3-17 @ Patriots Wild Card: Lost 3-17 @ Patriots  1995  Wild Card: Lost 22-37 @ Bills Wild Card: Lost 22-37 @ Bills  1994  Wild Card: Won 27-17 vs. Chiefs Divisional Round: Lost 21-22 @ Chargers Wild Card: Won 27-17 vs. Chiefs Divisional Round: Lost 21-22 @ Chargers  1992  Divisional Round: Won 31-0 vs. Chargers Conference Championship: Lost 10-29 vs. Bills Divisional Round: Won 31-0 vs. Chargers Conference Championship: Lost 10-29 vs. Bills  1990  Wild Card: Won 17-16 vs. Chiefs Divisional Round: Lost 34-44 @ Bills Wild Card: Won 17-16 vs. Chiefs Divisional Round: Lost 34-44 @ Bills  1985  Divisional Round: Won 24-21 vs. Browns Conference Championship: Lost 14-31 vs. Patriots Divisional Round: Won 24-21 vs. Browns Conference Championship: Lost 14-31 vs. Patriots  1984  Divisional Round: Won 31-10 vs. Seahawks Conference Championship: Won 45-28 vs. Steelers Super Bowl: Lost 16-38 vs. 49ers Divisional Round: Won 31-10 vs. Seahawks Conference Championship: Won 45-28 vs. Steelers Super Bowl: Lost 16-38 vs. 49ers  1983  Divisional Round: Lost 20-27 vs. Seahawks Divisional Round: Lost 20-27 vs. Seahawks  1982  Wild Card: Won 28-13 vs. Patriots Divisional Round: Won 34-13 vs. Chargers Conference Championship: Won 14-0 vs. Jets Super Bowl: Lost 17-27 vs. Redskins Wild Card: Won 28-13 vs. Patriots Divisional Round: Won 34-13 vs. Chargers Conference Championship: Won 14-0 vs. Jets Super Bowl: Lost 17-27 vs. Redskins  1981  Divisional Round: Lost 38-41 (OT) vs. Chargers Divisional Round: Lost 38-41 (OT) vs. Chargers  1979  Divisional Round: Lost 14-34 @ Steelers Divisional Round: Lost 14-34 @ Steelers  1978  Wild Card: Lost 9-17 vs. Oilers Wild Card: Lost 9-17 vs. Oilers  1974  Divisional Round: Lost 26-28 @ Raiders Divisional Round: Lost 26-28 @ Raiders  1973  Divisional Round: Won 34-16 vs. Bengals Conference Championship: Won 27-10 vs. Raiders Super Bowl: Won 24-17 vs. Vikings Divisional Round: Won 34-16 vs. Bengals Conference Championship: Won 27-10 vs. Raiders Super Bowl: Won 24-17 vs. Vikings  1972  Divisional Round: Won 20-14 vs. Browns Conference Championship: Won 21-17 @ Steelers Super Bowl: Won 14-7 vs. Redskins Divisional Round: Won 20-14 vs. Browns Conference Championship: Won 21-17 @ Steelers Super Bowl: Won 14-7 vs. Redskins  1971  Divisional Round: Won 27-24 (OT) @ Chiefs Conference Championship: Won 21-0 vs. Colts Super Bowl: Lost 3-24 vs. Cowboys Divisional Round: Won 27-24 (OT) @ Chiefs Conference Championship: Won 21-0 vs. Colts Super Bowl: Lost 3-24 vs. Cowboys  1970  Divisional Round: Lost 14-21 @ Raiders Divisional Round: Lost 14-21 @ Raiders The Dolphins\u2019 playoff history includes several runs of dominance followed by dry spells that rival those of the most downtrodden teams in league lore. Let\u2019s break down some of the most notable moments. The Dolphins are just under .500 all-time in the playoffs. Not counting Miami\u2019s 2022-2023 season playoff appearance, the team has a 20-21 record across 41 postseason contests. The Dolphins have been to the playoffs 23 times. Miami\u2019s most dominant runs of regular-season football came in the 1970s and 1990s when the team qualified for the playoffs a whopping seven times in each decade. Conversely, the Dolphins have fared quite poorly in recent memory. In the 2000s and 2010s combined, Miami played meaningful January football just four times, as the Dolphins failed to qualify for the playoffs 16 of 20 times across those two decades. In those 20 years, the Dolphins had seven head coaches (not counting interim head coaches) and 21 starting quarterbacks. Miami has represented the AFC in the Super Bowl five times. The Dolphins reached three consecutive Super Bowls across the 1971 (Dallas Cowboys), 1972 (Washington Redskins), and 1973 (Minnesota Vikings) seasons and played in the big game twice more in 1982 (Washington) and 1984 (San Francisco 49ers). The Dolphins have hoisted the Lombardi Trophy two times in the team\u2019s history, and the victories came in consecutive seasons. In 1972, Miami achieved a perfect season and is the only team to have accomplished such a feat in the modern era. Including playoff games, Miami went an unblemished 17-0 and defeated Washington 14-7 in Super Bowl VII. It was Miami\u2019s running game and defense that won the day for the Dolphins. QB Bob Griese was efficient but mostly just managed the game, completing eight passes on 11 attempts for 88 yards, one touchdown, and an interception. Hall of Fame fullback Larry Csonka amassed 112 yards on just 15 carries, bulldozing Washington defenders all over the field. Fellow ball carriers Jim Kiick and Mercury Morris added an additional 72 yards and one touchdown on the ground, as Miami held off Washington\u2019s comeback attempt in the fourth quarter and kept its NFC foe to just seven points on the day. Washington\u2019s lone points came off of a 49-yard fumble return for a touchdown on special teams when, after picking up the football following a blocked field-goal attempt, Dolphins kicker Garo Yepremian attempted a pass that fumbled out of his hands and was picked up by Washington\u2019s Mike Bass, culminating in one of the most embarrassing (but ultimately inconsequential) gaffes in Dolphins history. Legendary head coach Don Shula and the Dolphins won a second Super Bowl ring following the 1973 season, as the team clobbered the Vikings by a score of 24-7. Even less was needed from Griese in that game. He completed six of a measly seven pass attempts for 73 yards. Csonka piled up 145 yards and two touchdowns on 33 attempts and was supported by another 44 yards on 18 attempts and one touchdown combined between Kiick and Morris. Miami\u2019s defense held Minnesota to just seven points and 55 yards on the ground. Vikings QB Fran Tarkenton managed 182 yards through the air on top of a rushing score, but it wasn\u2019t enough to keep Minnesota competitive. Miami\u2019s other three Super Bowl appearances have all resulted in double-digit defeats. Miami was defeated 24-3 by the Cowboys in 1971, 27-17 by Washington in 1982, and 38-16 by the 49ers in 1984. The Dolphins last reached the Super Bowl in 1984, falling to the 49ers 38-16. That defeat constituted Hall of Fame QB Dan Marino\u2019s lone Super Bowl appearance despite the run of dominance he led in the \u201990s. Marino reached the AFC Championship twice more (1985, 1992), but each time was bested by an AFC East rival in the New England Patriots and Buffalo Bills, respectively.

Climate change impacts in the Arctic, including increasing temperatures, shifts in the distribution of multi-year ice, and changes in precipitation patterns, threaten polar bear populations in a number of ways.  Increasing temperatures are associated with a decrease in sea ice (both the amount and length of time sea ice forms). Since polar bears use sea ice as a platform to prey mainly on ringed and bearded seals, changes in sea ice can lead to less access to prey and an increase in malnourished or starving bears. Because of their strong association with the ice, ringed seal populations may also plummet due to loss of sea ice and result in even further reduction in polar bear food supplies. In addition, with less sea ice, female polar bears may have a more difficult time reaching traditional denning areas.

In addition, with less sea ice, female polar bears may have a more difficult time reaching traditional denning areas.  Oil spills from drilling platforms or tankers potentially threaten polar bears.  A polar bear's fur loses its insulating properties when covered with oil. Oil spills could diminish or contaminate polar bear food sources. Scientists are trying to determine whether noise from industrial subsistence or recreational activities could disturb polar bears and deter them from important habitats.

Scientists are trying to determine whether noise from industrial subsistence or recreational activities could disturb polar bears and deter them from important habitats.  The presence of toxic chemicals in polar bears may have long-term effects on their health and longevity.  Toxic chemicals from worldwide industrial activities are carried to the Arctic by air currents, rivers, and oceans.

It can be challenging when your cat eliminates outside of the box. The first step in retraining your cat to use the litterbox is to understand why your cat is going outside the box in the first place. There are many reasons why a cat might stop using the litterbox. The most important things to rule out are any potential health problems like constipation or urinary tract issues. Be sure to see your vet if your cat is showing signs of pain or distress. Untreated urinary crystals or stones can lead to life-threatening blockages , especially in male cats. Once you rule out physical causes, the problem may be very simple and easy to solve. Reasons cats start going outside of the box: Your cat dislikes a new brand or type of litter A dominant cat bullies a submissive cat in the box area The litterbox is not cleaned often enough Your cat doesn\u2019t feel comfortable going where you placed the box You have a multi-cat home with not enough litter boxes per cat A large cat (like a Maine Coon) has outgrown a standard size box Observe your cat\u2019s litterbox behavior closely. After you\u2019ve identified the most likely cause, how do you retrain your cat to begin using the box again? Keep in mind that the problem, even as you work to solve it, might have caused your cat to develop negative associations with using the box. Punishing or yelling at your cat for going outside the box can make those bad feelings worse, so avoid any negative reinforcements when accidents occur. The key to retraining your cat to use the litterbox again is to change those negative feelings into positive ones. Here\u2019s how to make using the box comfortable again. A litterbox should be 1\u00bd times the length of your cat , measured from the nose to the base of the tail. Large cats need large boxes. For kittens and senior cats, the sides need to be low enough for easy access. Have you switched from an open box to a closed box? Did you get a self-cleaning box recently? Your cat may prefer one box style over another . And most importantly, get multiple litterboxes for a multi-cat household. One box per cat plus one extra is ideal. There are many different types of kitty litter. Litter can be made from materials like clay, wood pellets, silica crystals, recycled newspaper pellets, walnut shells, and coconut husks, just to name a few. Your preferred type of litter may not be your cat\u2019s favorite. Sometimes a cat will develop an aversion to the texture of a particular kind of litter and prefer other surfaces like the carpet or a tile floor. You may have to experiment and purchase small containers of different types of litter until you find the right one.

Root cause analysis can be performed in six steps - define the event, find causes, find the root cause, find solutions, take action, verify solution effectiveness. Some of the RCA tools can be implemented during the root cause analysis steps . To define the event and go to the source of the problem, you can use the 5 Whys. To find the potential causes of the event in question, you may implement Fishbone diagrams. To uncover the root cause that lies at the heart of the problem, you can use a Scatter Chart and Pareto Analysis. Yes, there are root cause analysis tools templates. RCA templates are used to analyze a recurring problem and help eliminate the root causes. Root cause analysis teams drill down to the root of the problem in order to implement solutions so the problem won\u2019t appear again. The 5 Whys template can help ensure that business teams resolve the root cause of problems to avoid them from recurring. This 5 whys template has been designed to make it easier for you to ask and answer the question, \u201cWhy?\u201d. The Fishbone Diagram template can be used to explore the potential causes of a particular issue, enabling your team to find a solution more effectively. A Fishbone Diagram template is particularly useful when relying on experience and ideas rather than quantitative data. The Pareto chart template is used to identify and list the problems and their causes. Then, you can score each problem individually and group them together by their cause. This is a clear, visual way to compare various factors contributing to any given problem. A Scatter diagram template can be used to help you find the relationship between respective factors and influences. A scatter diagram charts numerical data pairs with a variable on each axis. Root cause analysis tools are important in determining and identifying defects and the main causes of defects. By identifying the root cause, the organization can find a permanent solution to it so that possibility of its future re-occurrence can be reduced or eliminated. RCA plays an important role in developing a logical approach to solving problems. The tools of root cause analysis are improving work efficiency by detecting and eliminating possible or existing problems at the beginning of a process, system, or production. Root cause analysis tools have countless applications in many industries. Here you can see the list of Root Cause Analysis Sectors. Engineering, automotive manufacturing, and industrial process control prevent environmental releases and be utilized for failure analysis in engineering and maintenance. IT and data security, where root cause analysis helps individuals investigate security breaches. Healthcare, where root cause analysis tools are used in environmental science, the medical device industry, occupational safety, and health. Environmental industries, where RCA tools are used to make accident analyses in the aviation and rail industry and prevent their reocurrence. The food and beverage industry to prevent food safety problems and regulatory action by identifying the causes.

Once the team has brainstormed all the possible causes of the problem, the team should rate the potential causes according to their level of importance and likelihood of contributing to the failure and develop a hierarchy. From the hierarchy the team should select which causes to further investigate. The 5 Why method is simply asking the question \u201cWhy\u201d enough times until you get through all the symptoms of a problem and down to the root cause. The 5 Whys is often used during the problem solving activities. It is also used in coordination with other analysis tools, such as the Cause and Effect Diagram, but can also be used as a standalone tool. The 5 Whys is most effective when the answers come from people who have hands-on experience of the issue being examined. To discover the root cause of a problem, keep asking \u201cwhy\u201d. By repeating \u201cwhy\u201d, you can drive down to the root cause of the problem. A general rule of thumb is that you should reach the 3rd to 5th \u201cwhy\u201d, or you may just address a symptom of the problem and not the actual root cause. The 5 Why Form can sometimes have three separate areas (or \u201clegs\u201d) to address the 5 Whys: Why it occurred, Why it was not detected and Why our systems failed. Each area should be explored and you may have more than one causal progression for each area. Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a well-defined tool that can identify various modes of failure within a system or process. In many companies if a major problem is detected in the process or product, the team is required to review any existing FMEAs in relation to the problem. The team should determine if the problem or effect of the failure was identified in the FMEA and if it was, how accurately the team evaluated the risk. If the problem is not included in the FMEA, the team should add any known information and then complete the following steps: List the current problem as a failure mode of the design or process Identify the impact of the failure by defining the severity of the problem or effect of failure List all probable causes and how many times they occur When reviewing a process FMEA, review the process flow or process diagram to help locate the root cause Next identify the Escape Point, which is the closest point in the process where the root cause could have been detected but was not Document any controls in place designed to prevent or detect the problem List any additional actions that could be implemented to prevent this problem from occurring again and assign an owner and a due date for each recommended action Carry any identified actions over to the counter-measure activity of the RCA Once the team has determined the root cause using any combination of the tools listed above then they must develop the appropriate counter-measures or corrective actions. In addition, the team should develop an action plan for implementation of the counter-measures. The counter-measures are usually divided into two categories: Short-term or immediate counter-measures \u2013 generally accomplishable in less than 1 week. If not it should be designated as a \u201cLong-term\u201d counter-measure. Long-term or permanent counter-measures \u2013 usually more complex and may require additional resources to complete. All \u201cLong-term\u201d counter-measures should be able to complete in less than 1 month. If not, they should be forwarded to the Continuous Improvement (CI) team for evaluation as part of a Kaizen or Black Belt project. The corrective action must be clearly defined and achievable by the team member assigned to complete the task. The action plan should also contain expected due dates for each of the corrective actions. It is often discovered that corrective actions without an owner or an expected due date seldom get completed. Occasionally the counter-measures require tasks to be completed by more than one of the team members simultaneously or in a certain order. The action plan should be used to track progress of individual action items required to complete implementation of the countermeasures. The team should also determine a Verification (or Validation) Plan. This is used to provide a documented performance appraisal of the counter-measures effectiveness. This could entail recording data or auditing any special controls developed and implemented during the RCA exercise. Evidence should be collected to verify the effectiveness of the counter-measures or corrective actions. In addition, it is good practice to re-assemble the team approximately 30 days after the permanent counter-measures are in place. The team should review the effectiveness of the counter-measures and determine if the problem has occurred since implementation of the counter-measures. The team should also review the process (if applicable) to assure all counter-measures are being followed. The development of a robust, well-planned Root Cause Analysis (RCA) process can be very valuable to the company by determining the root cause and taking action to prevent it from re-occurring. The lessons learned during an effective RCA can often be carried over to similar designs or processes. This should initiate a problem solving continuous improvement mind-set to spread throughout the company.

He previously served as a professor of economics at the University of Vienna , and after joining politics, as the spokesman of the Austrian Green Party . [2] [3]\nVan der Bellen was born in Austria to Russian and Estonian parents who were refugees from Stalinism , and he became a naturalized citizen of Austria together with his parents in 1958. He is a descendant of the former Russian Empire 's aristocratic Van der Bellen family of patrilineal Dutch ancestry dating back to 18th century.\nHe was a member of the National Council representing the Green Party there from 1994 to 2012, and served as both leader of the party as well as its parliamentary group. [4] [5]\nHe ran as a nominally independent candidate supported by the Greens in the 2016 presidential election , and finished second out of six in the first round before winning the second round against Norbert Hofer , a member of the Freedom Party . [6] [7] On 1 July, before he was due to be sworn into office, the results of the second round of voting were annulled by the Constitutional Court due to absentee votes being improperly counted too early, requiring the election to be re-held. [8] On 4 December 2016, he won the ensuing election, taking approximately 54% of the vote. [9]\nVan der Bellen has described himself as a centrist liberal , [10] and supports green and social liberal policies. As discussed in his 2015 book, [11] he is supportive of the European Union and advocates European federalism . [12] During the presidential election, he appealed to the political centre and was endorsed by the leaders of both the Social Democratic Party and the conservative People's Party . Van der Bellen is the second Green president of a European Union country (after Raimonds V\u0113jonis of Latvia) and the first to be directly elected by popular vote. [13]\nIn the 18th century, Van der Bellen's patrilineal ancestors emigrated from the Netherlands to the Russian Empire . During the Russian Civil War (1917\u20131922) part of his family escaped from the Bolsheviks and migrated to the newly independent Estonia. Before this, Van der Bellen's grandfather Aleksander von der Bellen served as head of the civilian regional government in Pskov . In Estonia, the family changed its name from von der Bellen to Van der Bellen . In 1931, Van der Bellen's father Alexander married his Estonian mother, Alma Sieboldt in Kihelkonna , Saaremaa , Estonia. Subsequently, his father obtained Estonian citizenship as well. In 1940, Estonia was invaded, occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union . In February or March 1941, Van der Bellen's father, mother, and older sister Vivian-Diana moved to Nazi Germany ; in line with the German\u2013Soviet Frontier Treaty they were accepted as the so-called Volksdeutsche .\nVia Lauksargiai (former Laugszargen, Memelland ) and a German resettlement camp in Werneck at W\u00fcrzburg , Van der Bellen's parents moved to Vienna , where their son Alexander was born in 1944 and baptized into the Lutheran Church . As the Red Army approached Vienna, the family escaped to the Kauner valley in Tyrol , where his father later became active as a businessman again.\nIn 1954, after completing primary school in Innsbruck, Van der Bellen switched to the Academic Grammar School Innsbruck (Akademisches Gymnasium Innsbruck), where he took his A-Levels in 1962. Until this time Van der Bellen had Estonian citizenship like his parents; he obtained Austrian citizenship around 1958. According to Van der Bellen, he did not complete mandatory service in the Austrian Armed Forces . He underwent the medical examination for military service twice, the first one resulting in him being rated unfit ( untauglich ). However, he successfully passed the second one. Later, he received several respites during his studies and due to his marriage. After that Van der Bellen was no longer summoned for service, due to his subsequent professorship.\nVan der Bellen studied economics at the University of Innsbruck and obtained a master's degree in 1966. With his dissertation Kollektive Haushalte und gemeinwirtschaftliche Unternehmungen: Probleme ihrer Koordination (\"Collective households and public-service enterprises: Problems of their coordination\") he was awarded the title of Dr. rer. oec (doctor rerum oeconomicarum) in 1970. From 1968 to 1971 he served as scientific assistant to Clemens August Andreae at the Institute for Public Finance at the University of Innsbruck, and from 1972 to 1974 as a research fellow at the Berlin Social Science Center (WZB). He was university assistant at the Institute for Public Finance at the University of Innsbruck and was awarded the qualification as university lecturer (habilitation) in 1975. He established friendship with Turkish economist Murat R. Sertel, with whom he worked on decision and preference theories and later on published several articles and discussion papers.\nIn 1976 Van der Bellen became associate professor at the University of Innsbruck, where he remained until 1980. During this time he moved to Vienna to study and research from 1977 to 1980 at the Federal Academy of Public Administration. From 1980 to 1999 he was extraordinary university professor for economics at the University of Vienna . Between 1990 and 1994 he there also became dean of the faculty for economics at University of Vienna. In October 1999 he became parliamentary leader of the Greens in the National Council and thus resigned as university professor in January 2009. Van der Bellen retired in February 2009.\nVan der Bellen's research focused on planning and financing procedures in the public sector, infrastructure financing, fiscal policy, public expenditure, government regulation policy, public undertakings, and environmental and transport policy. He has published in professional journals such as the Die Betriebswirtschaft , Econometrica, Journal of Economic Theory, \u00d6sterreichische Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Politikwissenschaft , Public Choice, Wirtschaftspolitische Bl\u00e4tter and the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr \u00f6ffentliche und gemeinwirtschaftliche Unternehmen .\nVan der Bellen married when he was 18 years old and became a father for the first time at 19. His relationship with Brigitte (born H\u00fcttner, 1943\u20132018) lasted over 50 years, until they divorced in 2015. He had two sons with her. Since December 2015 Van der Bellen has been married to a longtime friend and managing director of the Greens Club, Doris Schmidauer . He lives in Vienna and in Kaunertal , Tyrol .\nAs a young man Van der Bellen left the Lutheran Church, because he was upset about his local pastor. According to his own words he does not believe in the one God , but in a \"message or vision\" (\" Botschaft oder Vision \"), which in his view the New Testament states. However, in an interview in 2019 he stated, that he had rejoined the Protestant Church of the Augsburg Confession the same year. [14] [15]\nAccording to his own statement, Van der Bellen joined the only existing Freemason chapter in Innsbruck at the time, although he participated at meetings for a year, which he described as \"being active\". \"After that, as a purely passive member, I paid the membership fee for about 10 years and finally left on my explicit request\" (\" Danach habe ich als rein passives Mitglied noch etwa 10 Jahre lang den Mitgliedsbeitrag bezahlt und bin schlie\u00dflich auf meinen expliziten Wunsch hin ausgeschieden \"), Van der Bellen in a ZIB 2 elections interview with Armin Wolf (18 May 2016). According to Van der Bellen, he is no longer a Freemason.\nAfter Van der Bellen's victory in the 2016 Austrian presidential elections, President of Estonia Toomas Hendrik Ilves congratulated him. The Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs have stated that Van der Bellen could get back his Estonian passport at any time. This is possible because Van der Bellen's parents were citizens of Estonia as of 16 June 1940; children of such parents are automatically accepted as citizens. Urmas Paet , former foreign minister of Estonia and MEP said: \"the election results are a reason to congratulate Austrians twice. For Estonia and its people, the fact that Austria has elected an Estonian citizen as its president also plays a role.\"\nVan der Bellen is sometimes also called \"Sascha\" (which is an abbreviation of his first name) by his friends, colleagues, and within his party.\nVan der Bellen was a member of the Social Democratic Party from the mid-1970s until the late 1980s, but his interests later turned towards the environmental movement. His former postgraduate Peter Pilz , back then the spokesman of the Green Party , brought Van der Bellen into his party. Van der Bellen later described these changes as a development \"from an arrogant anti-capitalist to a generous left-liberal\", although the latter self-image in his autobiography of 2015 also changed into a \"liberal Anglo-Saxon coinage\".\nIn 1992, Van der Bellen was nominated by the Greens for the office of the President of the Court of Audit; he was defeated by the \u00d6VP -close Franz Fiedler. After the Greens suffered significant losses in the 1995 legislative elections on 17 December, Van der Bellen took over the party chairmanship from Christoph Chorherr in December 1997 and remained until October 2008, being the longest-serving spokesman in the history of the Austrian Greens, with almost eleven years in office.\nHe assumed chairmanship with the party having 4.8% approval in polls at that time.

After losses in the 2008 legislative elections , in which the Green Party's voteshare dropped to 10.11%, Van der Bellen, dubbed \"the green professor\" by the media, resigned on 3 October 2008 as spokesman of the Green Party. He handed over the office to the Third President of the National Council at the time, Eva Glawischnig . As designated spokesperson she was elected administrative party leader on 24 October and later officially endorsed and sworn in by the party congress (Bundeskongress).\nWith the beginning of the XIX. legislative period on 7 November 1994 Van der Bellen functioned as a member of the National Council for the first time and held this position until 2012. During the XXIV. legislative period he dropped out of the National Council on 5 July 2012. From 1999 to 2008 he was parliamentary leader of the Green Party in the National Council.\nDuring his time in the National Council, Van der Bellen also served as a member of the Budget, Main, Science, Financial, Industrial (as deputy chairman), Administrative and Foreign Affairs (as clerk and deputy chairman) committees as well as member of several subcommittees.

While he himself volunteered this activity, in addition to his still exercised National Council mandate, the new infrastructure office for him with a budget of 210,000 euros annually was endowed.\nAs a university commissioner, he campaigned for the improvement of the relationship between the city of Vienna and the universities located there.

With the elections slogan \"Go Professor go!\" he reached 11,952 preferred votes and thus achieved a precedence on the first place. Although he stated in multiple interviews: \"Should I get the preferential votes and it comes to a red-green government, I will definitely move into the Landtag \", he still did not accept the Gemeinderat mandate after the elections and remained in the National Council til 5 July 2012.\nOn 14 June 2012, Van der Bellen announced in a press conference to swap from the National Council to the Vienna Gemeinderat and Landtag . On 5 July 2012 he left the National Council. The inauguration took place in September 2012 at the first Gemeinderat meeting after the summer break. In January 2015, it was announced that Van der Bellen would retreat from Vienna's municipal politics at the end of the legislative period. In the internal list election of the Vienna Greens on 14 February, after the application deadline, he did not compete in the internal party candidacy. Thus he was no longer on a selectable place on the electoral lists of the Greens in the 2015 Viennese state elections.\nIn 2001, Van der Bellen said that he turned from an \"arrogant anti-capitalist \" into a \"broad-minded left-liberal \" over the course of his political career. [10] In his 2015 autobiography, Van der Bellen described himself as a liberal positioned in the political centre while downplaying his earlier description as left-liberal, [11] and said he was inspired by the Anglo-Saxon liberal tradition, particularly John Stuart Mill .

[18] He has opposed the government's decision to impose a limit on how many asylum-seekers it will allow into Austria. [19]\nVan der Bellen has commented that due to emerging Islamophobia and prejudice against women wearing headscarves, he could foresee a day when all non-Muslim women might also be asked to wear headscarves as a sign of solidarity with women who wear them on religious grounds. [20] The remarks were criticized widely, especially on the political right. [21]\nVan der Bellen has criticized U.S. President Donald Trump , warning of the dangers of right-wing populism . [22] He has opined that the British withdrawal from the European Union is damaging to the economies of both the United Kingdom and Europe. [23] He is opposed to recognising the Russian annexation of Crimea . [23] He has stated that the Austrian embassy in Israel should remain in Tel Aviv . [23]\nVan der Bellen has criticized Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and his supporters after mass pro-Erdo\u011fan protests by Turks in Austria , saying: \"In Austria there is freedom to demonstrate as long as it is peaceful. ... Everyone that accepts the right to demonstrate, has to see that the same rights \u2013 such as freedom of speech, press freedom, independent justice system, and freedom to demonstrate are being denied in Turkey by President Erdogan.\" [24] [25]\nSince August 2014 Van der Bellen has already been regarded as a presidential candidate. The Green Party reserved the domain \"vdb2016.at\" through the media agency Media Brothers for a possible presidential candidacy of Van der Bellen in November 2014. [26] After its reservation the party delegated the domain to the Association \"Together for Van der Bellen\" as of 6 January 2016. [27]\nOn 8 January 2016, Van der Bellen officially announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election by video message. [28]\nVan der Bellen ran as an independent candidate and thus non-party nominee for the office of President. As the longest-serving leader of the Green party (from 1997 to 2008) and as an afterwards still active party member, Van der Bellen's claimed nonpartisanism was questioned and challenged throughout his presidential campaign. [29] However, Van der Bellen officially suspended his party membership at the Greens as of 23 May 2016, demonstrating his willingness to strive for a nonpartisan incumbency. [30]\nRegardless of that the Green Party still supported him during his campaign; establishing the Association \"Together for Van der Bellen \u2013 Independent Initiative for the 2016 Presidential Election\" which comprised six employees and premises as well as 1.2 million euros financial aid. [31] The association is headquartered within the Green Party's head office, executive director of the association is Van der Bellen's campaign manager Lothar Lockl. [32] For the repetition of the second ballot, the association received a total of 18,398 private donations, which amounted to about 2.7 million euros. [33] In comparison, Van der Bellen's run-off opponent Norbert Hofer was vested with 3.4 million euros by his party . The Greens however, suspected that this sum only encompassed monetary and no material donations. [34]\nBy running as a non-partisan candidate, Van der Bellen could also avoid an official requirement for approval of the Green Party Congress, therefore discussions about the party basis as well as a possible non-unanimous voting result were bypassed. As an independent candidate, it would legally not have been necessary for him to disclose the campaign donations. Nevertheless, the Association \"Together for Van der Bellen\" still published them on their website. [33]\nIn the first round of the 2016 presidential election, Van der Bellen ranked second with 21.34% of the votes being behind Norbert Hofer with 35.05%.\nIn the second round of voting (the runoff election) on 22 May 2016, the provisional final result excluding postal votes was: Norbert Hofer with 51.93% and Alexander Van der Bellen with 48.07%. Therefore, no winner could be determined on election night. On the following day (23 May 2016), Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka announced the final results including postal votes, according to which Van der Bellen received 50.35% and Hofer 49.64% of valid votes. Van der Bellen had a lead of 31,026 votes on Hofer. The voter turnout was 72.7%. [35]\nThe complete final result was announced with a correction (in a constituency votes were counted twice), after which the difference has been reduced to less than 31,000 valid votes between Van der Bellen and Hofer, but this had little effect on the total percentage. (The changes only affected the third decimal place.)\nFollowing the election, the designated President Van der Bellen reaffirmed his views on the Freedom Party and stated that he would not charge them with the task to form a government, even if they became the largest party. [36] This would have been a novelty in the history of the Second Republic, since so far all Presidents had charged the chairperson of the largest party with the government formation.\nOn 8 June, Freedom Party chairman Heinz-Christian Strache brought in a 150-page notice of appeal to the Constitutional Court , which was intended to highlight deficiencies in the conduct of the second voting round. [37] On 1 July 2016, the Constitutional Court consented the electoral appeal of the Freedom Party. Because of irregularities that occurred in the counting of postal votes, the election had to be repeated in the whole of Austria. [38]\nVan der Bellen also won the second runoff election postponed to 4 December 2016, receiving 53.8% of valid votes (with a voter turnout of 74.2%). While Van der Bellen's lead in the run-off vote in May 2016 amounted to barely less than 31,000 votes, he was able to expand his lead in the second run-off vote in December 2016 to over 348,000 valid votes. [39] [40]\nOn 22 May 2022 Alexander Van der Bellen announced plans to run for a new term. [41] He later won the 2022 Austrian presidential election on 9 October 2022 with 56.2% of the votes. [42]\nAlexander Van der Bellen was inaugurated as President of Austria on 26 January 2017.

He previously served as a professor of economics at the University of Vienna , and after joining politics, as the spokesman of the Austrian Green Party . [2] [3] Van der Bellen was born in Austria to Russian and Estonian parents who were refugees from Stalinism , and he became a naturalized citizen of Austria together with his parents in 1958. He is a descendant of the former Russian Empire 's aristocratic Van der Bellen family of patrilineal Dutch ancestry dating back to 18th century. He was a member of the National Council representing the Green Party there from 1994 to 2012, and served as both leader of the party as well as its parliamentary group. [4] [5] He ran as a nominally independent candidate supported by the Greens in the 2016 presidential election , and finished second out of six in the first round before winning the second round against Norbert Hofer , a member of the Freedom Party . [6] [7] On 1 July, before he was due to be sworn into office, the results of the second round of voting were annulled by the Constitutional Court due to absentee votes being improperly counted too early, requiring the election to be re-held. [8] On 4 December 2016, he won the ensuing election, taking approximately 54% of the vote. [9] Van der Bellen has described himself as a centrist liberal , [10] and supports green and social liberal policies. As discussed in his 2015 book, [11] he is supportive of the European Union and advocates European federalism . [12] During the presidential election, he appealed to the political centre and was endorsed by the leaders of both the Social Democratic Party and the conservative People's Party . Van der Bellen is the second Green president of a European Union country (after Raimonds V\u0113jonis of Latvia) and the first to be directly elected by popular vote. [13] In the 18th century, Van der Bellen's patrilineal ancestors emigrated from the Netherlands to the Russian Empire . During the Russian Civil War (1917\u20131922) part of his family escaped from the Bolsheviks and migrated to the newly independent Estonia. Before this, Van der Bellen's grandfather Aleksander von der Bellen served as head of the civilian regional government in Pskov . In Estonia, the family changed its name from von der Bellen to Van der Bellen . In 1931, Van der Bellen's father Alexander married his Estonian mother, Alma Sieboldt in Kihelkonna , Saaremaa , Estonia. Subsequently, his father obtained Estonian citizenship as well. In 1940, Estonia was invaded, occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union . In February or March 1941, Van der Bellen's father, mother, and older sister Vivian-Diana moved to Nazi Germany ; in line with the German\u2013Soviet Frontier Treaty they were accepted as the so-called Volksdeutsche . Via Lauksargiai (former Laugszargen, Memelland ) and a German resettlement camp in Werneck at W\u00fcrzburg , Van der Bellen's parents moved to Vienna , where their son Alexander was born in 1944 and baptized into the Lutheran Church . As the Red Army approached Vienna, the family escaped to the Kauner valley in Tyrol , where his father later became active as a businessman again. In 1954, after completing primary school in Innsbruck, Van der Bellen switched to the Academic Grammar School Innsbruck (Akademisches Gymnasium Innsbruck), where he took his A-Levels in 1962. Until this time Van der Bellen had Estonian citizenship like his parents; he obtained Austrian citizenship around 1958. According to Van der Bellen, he did not complete mandatory service in the Austrian Armed Forces . He underwent the medical examination for military service twice, the first one resulting in him being rated unfit ( untauglich ). However, he successfully passed the second one. Later, he received several respites during his studies and due to his marriage. After that Van der Bellen was no longer summoned for service, due to his subsequent professorship. Van der Bellen studied economics at the University of Innsbruck and obtained a master's degree in 1966. With his dissertation Kollektive Haushalte und gemeinwirtschaftliche Unternehmungen: Probleme ihrer Koordination (\"Collective households and public-service enterprises: Problems of their coordination\") he was awarded the title of Dr. rer. oec (doctor rerum oeconomicarum) in 1970. From 1968 to 1971 he served as scientific assistant to Clemens August Andreae at the Institute for Public Finance at the University of Innsbruck, and from 1972 to 1974 as a research fellow at the Berlin Social Science Center (WZB). He was university assistant at the Institute for Public Finance at the University of Innsbruck and was awarded the qualification as university lecturer (habilitation) in 1975. He established friendship with Turkish economist Murat R. Sertel, with whom he worked on decision and preference theories and later on published several articles and discussion papers. In 1976 Van der Bellen became associate professor at the University of Innsbruck, where he remained until 1980. During this time he moved to Vienna to study and research from 1977 to 1980 at the Federal Academy of Public Administration. From 1980 to 1999 he was extraordinary university professor for economics at the University of Vienna . Between 1990 and 1994 he there also became dean of the faculty for economics at University of Vienna. In October 1999 he became parliamentary leader of the Greens in the National Council and thus resigned as university professor in January 2009. Van der Bellen retired in February 2009. Van der Bellen's research focused on planning and financing procedures in the public sector, infrastructure financing, fiscal policy, public expenditure, government regulation policy, public undertakings, and environmental and transport policy. He has published in professional journals such as the Die Betriebswirtschaft , Econometrica, Journal of Economic Theory, \u00d6sterreichische Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Politikwissenschaft , Public Choice, Wirtschaftspolitische Bl\u00e4tter and the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr \u00f6ffentliche und gemeinwirtschaftliche Unternehmen . Van der Bellen married when he was 18 years old and became a father for the first time at 19. His relationship with Brigitte (born H\u00fcttner, 1943\u20132018) lasted over 50 years, until they divorced in 2015. He had two sons with her. Since December 2015 Van der Bellen has been married to a longtime friend and managing director of the Greens Club, Doris Schmidauer . He lives in Vienna and in Kaunertal , Tyrol . As a young man Van der Bellen left the Lutheran Church, because he was upset about his local pastor. According to his own words he does not believe in the one God , but in a \"message or vision\" (\" Botschaft oder Vision \"), which in his view the New Testament states. However, in an interview in 2019 he stated, that he had rejoined the Protestant Church of the Augsburg Confession the same year. [14] [15] According to his own statement, Van der Bellen joined the only existing Freemason chapter in Innsbruck at the time, although he participated at meetings for a year, which he described as \"being active\". \"After that, as a purely passive member, I paid the membership fee for about 10 years and finally left on my explicit request\" (\" Danach habe ich als rein passives Mitglied noch etwa 10 Jahre lang den Mitgliedsbeitrag bezahlt und bin schlie\u00dflich auf meinen expliziten Wunsch hin ausgeschieden \"), Van der Bellen in a ZIB 2 elections interview with Armin Wolf (18 May 2016). According to Van der Bellen, he is no longer a Freemason. After Van der Bellen's victory in the 2016 Austrian presidential elections, President of Estonia Toomas Hendrik Ilves congratulated him. The Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs have stated that Van der Bellen could get back his Estonian passport at any time. This is possible because Van der Bellen's parents were citizens of Estonia as of 16 June 1940; children of such parents are automatically accepted as citizens. Urmas Paet , former foreign minister of Estonia and MEP said: \"the election results are a reason to congratulate Austrians twice. For Estonia and its people, the fact that Austria has elected an Estonian citizen as its president also plays a role.\" Van der Bellen is sometimes also called \"Sascha\" (which is an abbreviation of his first name) by his friends, colleagues, and within his party. Van der Bellen was a member of the Social Democratic Party from the mid-1970s until the late 1980s, but his interests later turned towards the environmental movement. His former postgraduate Peter Pilz , back then the spokesman of the Green Party , brought Van der Bellen into his party. Van der Bellen later described these changes as a development \"from an arrogant anti-capitalist to a generous left-liberal\", although the latter self-image in his autobiography of 2015 also changed into a \"liberal Anglo-Saxon coinage\". In 1992, Van der Bellen was nominated by the Greens for the office of the President of the Court of Audit; he was defeated by the \u00d6VP -close Franz Fiedler. After the Greens suffered significant losses in the 1995 legislative elections on 17 December, Van der Bellen took over the party chairmanship from Christoph Chorherr in December 1997 and remained until October 2008, being the longest-serving spokesman in the history of the Austrian Greens, with almost eleven years in office. He assumed chairmanship with the party having 4.8% approval in polls at that time. He led the party through three elections, each higher than the last: in the 1999 legislative elections the party got 7.4% of the vote, in the 2002 legislative elections it got 9.5% of the vote, and in the 2006 legislative elections the party got 11.05% of the vote. After losses in the 2008 legislative elections , in which the Green Party's voteshare dropped to 10.11%, Van der Bellen, dubbed \"the green professor\" by the media, resigned on 3 October 2008 as spokesman of the Green Party. He handed over the office to the Third President of the National Council at the time, Eva Glawischnig . As designated spokesperson she was elected administrative party leader on 24 October and later officially endorsed and sworn in by the party congress (Bundeskongress). With the beginning of the XIX. legislative period on 7 November 1994 Van der Bellen functioned as a member of the National Council for the first time and held this position until 2012. During the XXIV. legislative period he dropped out of the National Council on 5 July 2012. From 1999 to 2008 he was parliamentary leader of the Green Party in the National Council. During his time in the National Council, Van der Bellen also served as a member of the Budget, Main, Science, Financial, Industrial (as deputy chairman), Administrative and Foreign Affairs (as clerk and deputy chairman) committees as well as member of several subcommittees. In 2009\u201310 he was a substitute member and from 2010 to 2012 a member of the Austrian delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg . After the 2008 legislative elections , he was proposed by the Greens, who were no longer the third strongest party, as a counter-candidate to the controversial FP\u00d6 candidate Martin Graf for the post of Third President of the National Council, however, he failed to win the vote on 28 October 2008: Graf was elected with 109 out of 156 valid votes, Van der Bellen only received 27, and the remaining 20 votes went to other MPs. In February 2011, Van der Bellen was elected by the red-green city and state government as Commissioner for Universities and Research (also: Commissioner of the City of Vienna for Universities and Research, denotation in 2013). While he himself volunteered this activity, in addition to his still exercised National Council mandate, the new infrastructure office for him with a budget of 210,000 euros annually was endowed. As a university commissioner, he campaigned for the improvement of the relationship between the city of Vienna and the universities located there. At his initiative, regular meetings took place for the first time between representatives of the Viennese universities and the Municipal Department 35 (Municipal Department of the City of Vienna) in order to improve cooperation in immigration and residence matters for third-country students and researchers. The initiative was taken up by the Austrian Universities Conference \u2013 The Austrian Conference of Rectors (uniko) and extended from Vienna to the whole of Austria. On the initiative of University Commissioner Van der Bellen, the Vienna University Circle, an informal advisory board composed of rectors and vice-rectors of Viennese universities, including the research institution Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA), were launched. At the 2010 Viennese state elections on 10 October Van der Bellen stood as a candidate on the 29th place of the list of the Vienna Greens. With the elections slogan \"Go Professor go!\" he reached 11,952 preferred votes and thus achieved a precedence on the first place. Although he stated in multiple interviews: \"Should I get the preferential votes and it comes to a red-green government, I will definitely move into the Landtag \", he still did not accept the Gemeinderat mandate after the elections and remained in the National Council til 5 July 2012. On 14 June 2012, Van der Bellen announced in a press conference to swap from the National Council to the Vienna Gemeinderat and Landtag . On 5 July 2012 he left the National Council. The inauguration took place in September 2012 at the first Gemeinderat meeting after the summer break. In January 2015, it was announced that Van der Bellen would retreat from Vienna's municipal politics at the end of the legislative period. In the internal list election of the Vienna Greens on 14 February, after the application deadline, he did not compete in the internal party candidacy. Thus he was no longer on a selectable place on the electoral lists of the Greens in the 2015 Viennese state elections. In 2001, Van der Bellen said that he turned from an \"arrogant anti-capitalist \" into a \"broad-minded left-liberal \" over the course of his political career. [10] In his 2015 autobiography, Van der Bellen described himself as a liberal positioned in the political centre while downplaying his earlier description as left-liberal, [11] and said he was inspired by the Anglo-Saxon liberal tradition, particularly John Stuart Mill . [10] He is strongly supportive of the European Union , and advocates European federalism . [11] [12] During the 2016 presidential election, he appealed to the political centre and used \"Unser Pr\u00e4sident der Mitte\" (Our President of the centre) for his campaign slogan. [16] During the European migrant crisis , Van der Bellen has argued that Europe should accept refugees who have fled from war zones in Syria and elsewhere, [17] and has often mentioned his own background as the son of refugees in debates. [18] He has opposed the government's decision to impose a limit on how many asylum-seekers it will allow into Austria. [19] Van der Bellen has commented that due to emerging Islamophobia and prejudice against women wearing headscarves, he could foresee a day when all non-Muslim women might also be asked to wear headscarves as a sign of solidarity with women who wear them on religious grounds. [20] The remarks were criticized widely, especially on the political right. [21] Van der Bellen has criticized U.S. President Donald Trump , warning of the dangers of right-wing populism . [22] He has opined that the British withdrawal from the European Union is damaging to the economies of both the United Kingdom and Europe. [23] He is opposed to recognising the Russian annexation of Crimea . [23] He has stated that the Austrian embassy in Israel should remain in Tel Aviv . [23] Van der Bellen has criticized Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and his supporters after mass pro-Erdo\u011fan protests by Turks in Austria , saying: \"In Austria there is freedom to demonstrate as long as it is peaceful. ... Everyone that accepts the right to demonstrate, has to see that the same rights \u2013 such as freedom of speech, press freedom, independent justice system, and freedom to demonstrate are being denied in Turkey by President Erdogan.\" [24] [25] Since August 2014 Van der Bellen has already been regarded as a presidential candidate.

[32] For the repetition of the second ballot, the association received a total of 18,398 private donations, which amounted to about 2.7 million euros. [33] In comparison, Van der Bellen's run-off opponent Norbert Hofer was vested with 3.4 million euros by his party . The Greens however, suspected that this sum only encompassed monetary and no material donations.

This is usually accomplished with flashing, gutters and eavestroughs. So, what is an eavestrough, and how is it different than a gutter? Read on for some clarification.\nThe easiest way to understand an eavestrough is to understand eaves. Eaves are a section of the roof that extends past the wall. This creates a separate \u201cdrip line,\u201d which directs water away from the walls. An eavestrough, therefore, is a small trough that collects rainwater at the base of the eaves.\nIf that description sounded an awful lot like rain gutters, you\u2019re not far off. They are more or less the same thing\u2014gutters are simply a catch-all term for anything performing a similar function. That\u2019s why you have gutters near sidewalks and in bowling alleys. They collect water (or bowling balls) and move it elsewhere.\nIn short, \u201ceavestroughs\u201d is just a word for a very specific type of gutter: the ones on your building\u2019s eaves. The reason people get confused is because many contractors and laypeople use the terms interchangeably, without ever explaining that they\u2019re virtually the same thing.\nRainwater and melting snow can cause a lot of damage if they\u2019re left to penetrate your roof, walls or foundation. Rain gutters are designed to collect any water on your roof, then safely divert it a distance away from your walls and foundation. The water soaks into your yard and eventually becomes part of the groundwater system.\nIf you didn\u2019t have gutters\u2014or if the gutters become clogged\u2014the water will collect on the roof, then run down the walls and into the foundation.

This is usually accomplished with flashing, gutters and eavestroughs. So, what is an eavestrough, and how is it different than a gutter? Read on for some clarification. The easiest way to understand an eavestrough is to understand eaves. Eaves are a section of the roof that extends past the wall. This creates a separate \u201cdrip line,\u201d which directs water away from the walls. An eavestrough, therefore, is a small trough that collects rainwater at the base of the eaves. If that description sounded an awful lot like rain gutters, you\u2019re not far off. They are more or less the same thing\u2014gutters are simply a catch-all term for anything performing a similar function. That\u2019s why you have gutters near sidewalks and in bowling alleys. They collect water (or bowling balls) and move it elsewhere. In short, \u201ceavestroughs\u201d is just a word for a very specific type of gutter: the ones on your building\u2019s eaves. The reason people get confused is because many contractors and laypeople use the terms interchangeably, without ever explaining that they\u2019re virtually the same thing. Rainwater and melting snow can cause a lot of damage if they\u2019re left to penetrate your roof, walls or foundation. Rain gutters are designed to collect any water on your roof, then safely divert it a distance away from your walls and foundation. The water soaks into your yard and eventually becomes part of the groundwater system. If you didn\u2019t have gutters\u2014or if the gutters become clogged\u2014the water will collect on the roof, then run down the walls and into the foundation. Your roof may experience leaks. The water might also soak into the walls, which can stain the interior, compromise the wall\u2019s structural integrity and cause mold and mildew to develop. Finally, when too much water pools around a building\u2019s foundation, the foundation can crack and shift. When your foundation fails, it can cost tens of thousands of dollars to repair.

It was developed by Larry Gelbart as the first original spin-off series adapted from the 1970 feature film M*A*S*H , which, in turn, was based on Richard Hooker 's 1968 novel MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors . The series, which was produced with 20th Century Fox Television for CBS, follows a team of doctors and support staff stationed at the \"4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital \" in Uijeongbu , South Korea , during the Korean War (1950\u201353).\nThe ensemble cast originally featured Alan Alda and Wayne Rogers as surgeons Benjamin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce and \"Trapper\" John McIntyre, the protagonists of the show, joined by Larry Linville as surgeon Frank Burns, Loretta Swit as head nurse Margaret \"Hot Lips\" Houlihan, McLean Stevenson as company commander Henry Blake, Gary Burghoff as company clerk Walter \"Radar\" O'Reilly, Jamie Farr as orderly Maxwell Klinger, and William Christopher as the chaplain, Father John Mulcahy. Over the run of the show, several members of the main cast were replaced: Wayne Rogers was replaced by Mike Farrell as B. J. Hunnicutt, McLean Stevenson was replaced by Harry Morgan as Sherman Potter, Larry Linville was replaced by David Ogden Stiers as Charles Emerson Winchester III, and when Gary Burghoff left the show, the Maxwell Klinger character moved into the company clerk role. Longtime supporting cast members included Kellye Nakahara , Jeff Maxwell , Allan Arbus , and Edward Winter .\nThe series varied in style and tone \u2013 including broad comedy and tragic drama \u2013 which can be attributed to fluctuating writing staff over the life of the show, and the variety of sources contributing to the stories, such as actor Alan Alda and surgeons who served in the Korean War. [1] The show's title sequence features an instrumental version of \" Suicide Is Painless \", the original film's theme song. [2]\nThe show was created after an attempt to film the original book's sequel, M*A*S*H Goes to Maine , failed. The television series is the best-known of the M*A*S*H works, and one of the highest-rated shows in U.S. television history . Its final episode, \" Goodbye, Farewell and Amen \", was the most-watched television broadcast in American history from 1983 until 2010, [3] and remains both the most-watched finale of any television series and the most-watched episode of a scripted series. [4]\nM*A*S*H aired weekly on CBS, with most episodes being a half-hour in length. The series is usually categorized as a situation comedy , though it has also been described as a \" dark comedy \" or a \" dramedy \" because of the often dramatic subject matter. [A]\nThe show is an ensemble piece revolving around key personnel in a United States Army Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) in the Korean War (1950\u201353). The \"4077th MASH\" was one of several surgical units in Korea. The asterisks in the name are not part of military nomenclature and were creatively introduced in the novel and used in only the posters for the movie version, not the actual movie.\nEarly seasons aired on network prime time while the Vietnam War was still ongoing; the show was forced to walk the fine line of commenting on that war while at the same time not seeming to protest against it. The show's discourse, under the cover of comedy, often questioned, mocked, and grappled with America's role in the Cold War.\nEpisodes were both plot- and character-driven, with several narrated by one of the show's characters as the contents of a letter home. The show's tone could move from silly to sobering from one episode to the next, with dramatic tension often occurring between the unwilling civilian draftees of 4077th \u2013 Hawkeye, Trapper John, and B.J. Hunnicutt, for example \u2013 and the \"regular Army\" characters, such as Margaret Houlihan and Colonel Potter, who enlisted voluntarily. Other characters, such as Lt. Col. Blake, Maj. Winchester, and Cpl. Klinger, help demonstrate various American civilian attitudes toward Army life, while guest characters played by such actors as Eldon Quick , Herb Voland , Mary Wickes , and Tim O'Connor also help further the show's discussion of America's place as Cold War participant and peace maker.\nThrough changes of personnel M*A*S*H maintained a relatively constant ensemble cast , with four characters \u2013 Hawkeye , Father Mulcahy , Margaret Houlihan , and Maxwell Klinger \u2013 on the show for all 11 seasons. Several other main characters departed or joined the program during its run, and numerous guest actors and recurring characters were used. The writers found creating so many names difficult, and used names from elsewhere; for example, characters on the seventh season were named after the 1978 Los Angeles Dodgers .

Colonel Henry Blake , Loretta Swit as head nurse Major Margaret \"Hot Lips\" Houlihan , Larry Linville as surgeon Major Frank Burns , Gary Burghoff as company clerk Corporal Walter Eugene \"Radar\" O'Reilly , Jamie Farr as combat medic Corporal Maxwell Klinger , and William Christopher as chaplain 1st Lieutenant Father John Patrick Francis Mulcahy . At the end of the third season, Rogers and Stevenson left the show, with their characters written out, and they were replaced by Mike Farrell as surgeon Captain B. J. Hunnicutt and Harry Morgan as surgeon Colonel Sherman T. Potter as the new commanding officer. After season five, Linville left to be replaced by David Ogden Stiers as surgeon Major Charles Emerson Winchester III . Early in season eight, Burghoff left the show; Klinger (Farr) was moved to company clerk to replace Radar, while G. W. Bailey joined the cast to play Staff Sergeant Luther Rizzo, the unit's motor pool sergeant. Other long-serving actors on the show include Kellye Nakahara as Nurse Kellye, Jeff Maxwell as Private Igor Straminsky, Johnny Haymer as Sergeant Zelmo Zale, the supply sergeant, Allan Arbus as psychiatrist Major Sidney Freedman, and Edward Winter as intelligence officer Colonel Sam Flagg.\nAs the series progressed, it made a significant shift from being primarily a comedy with dramatic undertones to a drama with comedic overtones. This was a result of changes in writing and production staff. Series co-creator and comedy writer Larry Gelbart departed after Season 4. Executive Producer Gene Reynolds departed at the conclusion of Season 5 in 1977, resulting in M*A*S*H being almost fully stripped of its original comedic foundation by the beginning of Season 6. [1]\nWhereas Gelbart and Reynolds were the comedic voice of M*A*S*H for the show's first five seasons (1972\u20131977), Alan Alda and newly promoted Executive Producer Burt Metcalfe became the new dramatic voice of M*A*S*H for Seasons 6\u201311. By the start of Season 8 (1979\u20131980), the writing staff had been completely overhauled, and with the departure of cast members McLean Stevenson, Larry Linville, Wayne Rogers and Gary Burghoff, M*A*S*H displayed a distinctively different feel, consciously moving between comedy and drama.\nThe end of the Vietnam War in 1975 was a significant factor as to why storylines become less political in nature and more character driven. Several episodes experimented by going outside the sitcom format:\n- \"Point of View\" \u2013 shown from the perspective of a soldier with a throat wound\n- \"Dreams\" \u2013 an idea of Alda's, where during a deluge of casualties, members of the 4077 take naps on a rotation basis, allowing the viewer to see the simultaneously lyrical and disturbing dreams\n- \"A War For All Seasons\" \u2013 features a story line that takes place over the course of 1951\n- \"Life Time\" \u2013 utilizes a real time method of narration [1]\nAnother change was the infusion of story lines based on actual events and medical developments that materialized during the Korean War. Considerable research was done by the producers, including interviews with actual MASH surgeons and personnel to develop story lines rooted in the war itself. Such early 1950s events as the McCarthy era , various sporting events, and the stardom of Marilyn Monroe were all incorporated into various episodes, a trend that continued until the end of the series. [1]\nWhile the series remained popular through these changes, it eventually began to run out of creative steam. Korean War doctors regularly contacted producers with experiences that they thought might make for a good storyline, only to learn the idea had previously been used. Harry Morgan admitted that he felt \"the cracks were starting to show\" by season 9 (1980\u20131981). [1] Alda wished to make season 10 (1981\u20131982) M*A*S*H ' s last, but was persuaded by CBS to produce a slightly shortened 11th season, coupled with a farewell movie finale, at CBS' request. In the end, season 11 had 15 episodes (although six had been filmed during season 10 and held over) and a 2\n+\n1 \u2044 2 -hour movie, which was treated as five episodes and was filmed before the nine remaining episodes. The final episode produced was the penultimately aired episode \"As Time Goes By\". The series finale movie, titled \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\", became the most watched U.S. television broadcast in history at that time, with 106 million viewers. [1]\nThe 4077th consisted of two separate sets. An outdoor set in the mountains near Malibu ( Calabasas , Los Angeles County, California) (\n34\u00b05\u203247.55\u2033N 118\u00b044\u203241.24\u2033W ) was used for most exterior and tent scenes for every season. This was the same location used to shoot the movie, although the number of tents was reduced and there were changes made to the positions of several tents for the TV show. The indoor set, on Stage 09 at Fox Studios in Century City , was used for the indoor scenes for the run of the series. Later, after the indoor set was renovated to permit many of the \"outdoor\" scenes to be filmed there, both sets were used for exterior shooting as script requirements dictated (e.g., night scenes were far easier to film on the sound stage, but scenes at the helicopter pad required using the ranch).\nJust as the series was wrapping production, a brush fire destroyed most of the outdoor set on October 9, 1982. The fire was written into the final episode \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\" as a forest fire caused by enemy incendiary bombs that forced the 4077th to move out.\nThe Malibu location is today known as Malibu Creek State Park . Formerly called the Century Ranch and owned by 20th Century Fox Studios until the 1980s, the site today is returning to a natural state, and is marked by a rusted Jeep and a Dodge ambulance used in the show. Through the 1990s, the area was occasionally used for television commercial production.\nOn February 23, 2008, series stars Mike Farrell, Loretta Swit and William Christopher (along with producers Gene Reynolds and Burt Metcalfe and M*A*S*H director Charles S. Dubin) reunited at the set to celebrate its partial restoration. The rebuilt signpost is now displayed on weekends, along with tent markers and maps and photos of the set. The state park is open to the public. It was also the location where the film How Green Was My Valley (1941) and the Planet of the Apes television series (1974) were filmed, among many other productions. Much of this location, including the signpost and markers, was thought to have been destroyed in the 2018 Woolsey Fire [6] but subsequently was determined to have survived the fire. [7]\nThe exhibit M*A*S*H: Binding Up the Wounds was at the National Museum of American History from July 30, 1983, through February 3, 1985. The exhibit was extremely popular, drawing more than 17,000 in a single week, a record for any Smithsonian display. [8]\nOn exhibit were The Swamp and Operating Room sets, one of the show's 14 Emmy Awards, early drafts of the pilot script, costumes from the show and other memorabilia. Sets were decorated with props from the show including the iconic signpost, Hawkeye's still and Major Winchester's Webcor tape recorder and phonograph. The exhibit also encouraged visitors to compare the show to real Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals of the Korean and the Vietnam Wars. [9] [10]\nSeries creators Larry Gelbart and Gene Reynolds wanted M*A*S*H broadcast without a laugh track . Though CBS initially rejected the idea, a compromise was reached that allowed for omitting the laughter during operating room scenes if desired. \"We told the network that under no circumstances would we ever can laughter during an OR scene when the doctors were working,\" said Gelbart in 1998. \"It's hard to imagine that 300 people were in there laughing at somebody's guts being sewn up.\" [11]\nSeasons 1\u20135 utilized a more invasive laugh track; a more subdued audience was employed for Seasons 6\u201311 when the series shifted from sitcom to comedy drama with the departure of Gelbart and Reynolds. Several episodes (\"O.R.\", \"The Bus\", \" Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler? \", \" The Interview \", \"Point of View\", and \" Dreams \" among them) omitted the laugh track altogether; as did almost all of Season 11, including the 135-minute series finale, \" Goodbye, Farewell and Amen \". [12] The laugh track is also omitted from some international and syndicated airings of the show; on one occasion during an airing on BBC2 , the laugh track was accidentally left on, and viewers expressed their displeasure, an apology from the network for the \"technical difficulty\" was later released, as during its original run on BBC2 in the UK, it was shown without the laugh track. UK DVD critics speak poorly of the laugh track, stating \"canned laughter is intrusive at the best of times, but with a programme like M*A*S*H , it's downright unbearable.\" [13]\nOn all released DVDs, both in Region 1 (including the US and Canada) and Region 2 (Europe, including the UK), an option is given to watch the show with or without the laugh track. [14] [15]\n\"They're a lie,\" said Gelbart in a 1992 interview. \"You're telling an engineer when to push a button to produce a laugh from people who don't exist. It's just so dishonest. The biggest shows when we were on the air were All in the Family and The Mary Tyler Moore Show both of which were taped before a live studio audience where laughter made sense,\" continued Gelbart. \"But our show was a film show \u2013 supposedly shot in the middle of Korea . So the question I always asked the network was, 'Who are these laughing people? Where did they come from?'\" Gelbart persuaded CBS to test the show in private screenings with and without the laugh track. The results showed no measurable difference in the audience's enjoyment. \"So you know what they said?\" Gelbart said. \" 'Since there's no difference, let's leave it alone!' The people who defend laugh tracks have no sense of humor.\" [12] Gelbart summed up the situation by saying, \"I always thought it cheapened the show. The network got their way. They were paying for dinner.\" [16]\nM*A*S*H was one of the first network series to feature brief partial nudity (notably Gary Burghoff's buttocks in \"The Sniper\", Hawkeye in \"Dear Dad Again\" and \"An Eye for a Tooth\"). [ citation needed ]\nIn his blog, writer Ken Levine revealed that on one occasion, when the cast offered too many nitpicking \"notes\" on a script, his writing partner and he changed the script to a \"cold show\" \u2013 one set during the frigid Korean winter. The cast then had to stand around barrel fires in parkas at the Malibu ranch when the temperatures neared 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). Levine says, \"This happened maybe twice, and we never got a ticky-tack note again.\" [17]\nJackie Cooper wrote that Alan Alda \u2013 whom Cooper directed in several episodes during the first two seasons \u2013 concealed what Cooper felt was a lot of hostility toward him, and the two barely spoke to each other by the time Cooper's tenure on the show ended. [18]\n\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\" was the final episode of M*A*S*H. Special television sets were placed in PX parking lots, auditoriums and day rooms of the U.S. Army in Korea so that military personnel could watch that episode, in spite of 14 hours' time-zone difference with the East Coast of the US. The episode aired on February 28, 1983, and was 2 1 \u2044 2 hours long. The episode got a Nielsen rating of 60.2 and 77 share [20] and according to a New York Times article from 1983, the final episode of M*A*S*H had 125 million viewers. [21]\nWhen the M*A*S*H finale aired in 1983, more than 83.3 million homes in the United States had televisions, compared to almost 115 million in February 2010. [22]\n\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\" broke the record for the highest percentage of homes with television sets to watch a television series. Stories persist that the episode was seen by so many people that the New York City Sanitation/Public Works Department reported the plumbing systems broke down in some parts of the city from so many New Yorkers waiting until the end to use the toilet. Articles copied into Alan Alda's book The Last Days of M*A*S*H include interviews with New York City Sanitation workers citing the spike in water use on that night. According to the interviews at 11:03 pm, EST New York City public works noted the highest water usage at one given time in the city's history. They attributed this to the fact that in the three minutes after the finale ended, around 77 percent of the people of New York City flushed their toilets. [23] These stories have all since been identified as part of an urban legend dating back to the days of the Amos and Andy radio program in the 1930s. [24]\nThe series premiered in the US on September 17, 1972, and ended on February 28, 1983, with the finale, showcased as a television film , titled \" Goodbye, Farewell and Amen \", becoming the most-watched and highest-rated single television episode in US television history at the time, with a record-breaking 125 million viewers (60.2 rating and 77 share), [25] according to the New York Times . [21] It had struggled in its first season and was at risk of being cancelled. [26] In season two, M*A*S*H was placed in a better time slot by CBS (airing after the popular All in the Family , taking the place of Bridget Loves Bernie , which had been canceled after one season despite good ratings due to religious groups protesting the show's premise of an inter-faith marriage between the title characters); the show then became one of the top 10 programs of the year and stayed in the top 20 programs for the rest of its run. [26] It is still broadcast in syndication on various television stations. The series, which depicted events occurring during a three-year war, spanned 256 episodes and lasted 11 seasons. The Korean War lasted 1,128 days, meaning each episode of the series would have averaged almost four and a half days of real time. Many of the stories in the early seasons are based on tales told by real MASH surgeons who were interviewed by the production team. Like the movie, the series was as much an allegory about the Vietnam War (still in progress when the show began) as it was about the Korean War . [27]\nThe episodes \" Abyssinia, Henry \" and \" The Interview \" were ranked number 20 and number 80, respectively, on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time in 1997. [28] In 2002, M*A*S*H was ranked number 25 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time . [29] In February 2008, the series was named the number-one smartest TV show of all time by Jim Werdell, chairman of Mensa International , who said that it \"had smart repartee and was so much more than a comedy\". [30] In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked it as the fifth-best written TV series ever [31] and TV Guide ranked it as the eighth-greatest show of all time. [32] In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked it as the 16th-greatest TV show.

This marked the first time the series was made available on an internet platform. As of July 1, 2015, all 11 seasons were available; syndicated versions of hour-long episodes were utilized for streaming, splitting these shows into two parts. [46] In contrast to the DVD sets, the Netflix streams did not have an option for disabling the laugh track on the soundtrack. On April 1, 2016, Netflix' contract to stream the series expired and M*A*S*H was removed from the platform. [47]\nIn July 2017, it was announced that Hulu had acquired online streaming rights for the entire run of M*A*S*H, along with several other 20th Century Fox-owned TV programs. [48] All 256 episodes were added to Hulu beginning June 29, 2018. All episodes were scanned in 1080 HD from the original 35mm negatives and are presented in 16:9 widescreen by cropping the top and bottom off the original 4:3 aspect ratio. All the episodes are also available on Disney+ . [49]\nThe two-season spin-off AfterMASH (1983\u20131985) inherited the parent show's Monday night time slot and featured several of its main characters reunited in a Midwestern hospital after the war. [50] The more successful Trapper John, M.D. (1979\u20131986) took place nearly three decades after the events of M*A*S*H and depicted Trapper John McIntyre as chief of surgery at a San Francisco hospital; [51] its producers argued successfully in court that it was based on the earlier movie rather than the TV series. [52] In an unpurchased television pilot, W*A*L*T*E*R (1984), Walter \"Radar\" O'Reilly joins the St. Louis police force after his farm fails following his return to the U.S.\nMaking M*A*S*H, a documentary special narrated by Mary Tyler Moore that takes viewers behind the production of the season 8 episodes \"Old Soldiers\" and \"Lend a Hand\", was produced for PBS airing on January 21, 1981. The special was later included in the syndicated rerun package, with new narration by producer Michael Hirsch. [53]\nThree retrospective specials were produced to commemorate the show's 20th, 30th and 50th anniversaries:\n- Memories of M*A*S*H , hosted by Shelley Long and featuring clips from the series and interviews with cast members, was aired by CBS on November 25, 1991.\n- M*A*S*H: 30th Anniversary Reunion , in which the surviving cast members and producers gathered to reminisce, aired on Fox on May 17, 2002. The two-hour broadcast was hosted by Mike Farrell, who also got to interact with the actor he replaced, Wayne Rogers; previously filmed interviews with McLean Stevenson and Larry Linville (who had died in 1996 and 2000, respectively,) were also featured.\n- M*A*S*H: When Television Changed Forever , a one-hour retrospective commemorating the show's 50th anniversary, aired on Reelz on September 13, 2022. It featured new exclusive interviews with cast members Jamie Farr, Mike Farrell and Jeff Maxwell, as well as producers and writers, exploring the series\u2019 popularity and creative firsts.\nMemories of M*A*S*H and M*A*S*H: 30th Anniversary Reunion are included as bonuses on the Collector's Edition DVD of \"Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen\". Also included is \"M*A*S*H: Television's Serious Sitcom,\" a 2002 episode of A&E channel's Biography program that detailed the show's history.\nIn the late 1980s, the cast had a partial reunion in a series of commercials for IBM products, including personal computers and the AS/400 system. All of the front-billed regulars (with the exceptions of Farrell and Stevenson) appeared in the spots over time. [54] [55]\nFurther reading\n- Gelbart, Larry. (1998).

It was developed by Larry Gelbart as the first original spin-off series adapted from the 1970 feature film M*A*S*H , which, in turn, was based on Richard Hooker 's 1968 novel MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors . The series, which was produced with 20th Century Fox Television for CBS, follows a team of doctors and support staff stationed at the \"4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital \" in Uijeongbu , South Korea , during the Korean War (1950\u201353). The ensemble cast originally featured Alan Alda and Wayne Rogers as surgeons Benjamin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce and \"Trapper\" John McIntyre, the protagonists of the show, joined by Larry Linville as surgeon Frank Burns, Loretta Swit as head nurse Margaret \"Hot Lips\" Houlihan, McLean Stevenson as company commander Henry Blake, Gary Burghoff as company clerk Walter \"Radar\" O'Reilly, Jamie Farr as orderly Maxwell Klinger, and William Christopher as the chaplain, Father John Mulcahy. Over the run of the show, several members of the main cast were replaced: Wayne Rogers was replaced by Mike Farrell as B. J. Hunnicutt, McLean Stevenson was replaced by Harry Morgan as Sherman Potter, Larry Linville was replaced by David Ogden Stiers as Charles Emerson Winchester III, and when Gary Burghoff left the show, the Maxwell Klinger character moved into the company clerk role. Longtime supporting cast members included Kellye Nakahara , Jeff Maxwell , Allan Arbus , and Edward Winter . The series varied in style and tone \u2013 including broad comedy and tragic drama \u2013 which can be attributed to fluctuating writing staff over the life of the show, and the variety of sources contributing to the stories, such as actor Alan Alda and surgeons who served in the Korean War. [1] The show's title sequence features an instrumental version of \" Suicide Is Painless \", the original film's theme song. [2] The show was created after an attempt to film the original book's sequel, M*A*S*H Goes to Maine , failed. The television series is the best-known of the M*A*S*H works, and one of the highest-rated shows in U.S. television history . Its final episode, \" Goodbye, Farewell and Amen \", was the most-watched television broadcast in American history from 1983 until 2010, [3] and remains both the most-watched finale of any television series and the most-watched episode of a scripted series. [4] M*A*S*H aired weekly on CBS, with most episodes being a half-hour in length. The series is usually categorized as a situation comedy , though it has also been described as a \" dark comedy \" or a \" dramedy \" because of the often dramatic subject matter. [A] The show is an ensemble piece revolving around key personnel in a United States Army Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) in the Korean War (1950\u201353). The \"4077th MASH\" was one of several surgical units in Korea. The asterisks in the name are not part of military nomenclature and were creatively introduced in the novel and used in only the posters for the movie version, not the actual movie. Early seasons aired on network prime time while the Vietnam War was still ongoing; the show was forced to walk the fine line of commenting on that war while at the same time not seeming to protest against it. The show's discourse, under the cover of comedy, often questioned, mocked, and grappled with America's role in the Cold War. Episodes were both plot- and character-driven, with several narrated by one of the show's characters as the contents of a letter home. The show's tone could move from silly to sobering from one episode to the next, with dramatic tension often occurring between the unwilling civilian draftees of 4077th \u2013 Hawkeye, Trapper John, and B.J. Hunnicutt, for example \u2013 and the \"regular Army\" characters, such as Margaret Houlihan and Colonel Potter, who enlisted voluntarily. Other characters, such as Lt. Col. Blake, Maj. Winchester, and Cpl. Klinger, help demonstrate various American civilian attitudes toward Army life, while guest characters played by such actors as Eldon Quick , Herb Voland , Mary Wickes , and Tim O'Connor also help further the show's discussion of America's place as Cold War participant and peace maker. Through changes of personnel M*A*S*H maintained a relatively constant ensemble cast , with four characters \u2013 Hawkeye , Father Mulcahy , Margaret Houlihan , and Maxwell Klinger \u2013 on the show for all 11 seasons. Several other main characters departed or joined the program during its run, and numerous guest actors and recurring characters were used. The writers found creating so many names difficult, and used names from elsewhere; for example, characters on the seventh season were named after the 1978 Los Angeles Dodgers .

At the end of the third season, Rogers and Stevenson left the show, with their characters written out, and they were replaced by Mike Farrell as surgeon Captain B. J. Hunnicutt and Harry Morgan as surgeon Colonel Sherman T. Potter as the new commanding officer. After season five, Linville left to be replaced by David Ogden Stiers as surgeon Major Charles Emerson Winchester III . Early in season eight, Burghoff left the show; Klinger (Farr) was moved to company clerk to replace Radar, while G. W. Bailey joined the cast to play Staff Sergeant Luther Rizzo, the unit's motor pool sergeant. Other long-serving actors on the show include Kellye Nakahara as Nurse Kellye, Jeff Maxwell as Private Igor Straminsky, Johnny Haymer as Sergeant Zelmo Zale, the supply sergeant, Allan Arbus as psychiatrist Major Sidney Freedman, and Edward Winter as intelligence officer Colonel Sam Flagg. As the series progressed, it made a significant shift from being primarily a comedy with dramatic undertones to a drama with comedic overtones. This was a result of changes in writing and production staff. Series co-creator and comedy writer Larry Gelbart departed after Season 4. Executive Producer Gene Reynolds departed at the conclusion of Season 5 in 1977, resulting in M*A*S*H being almost fully stripped of its original comedic foundation by the beginning of Season 6. [1] Whereas Gelbart and Reynolds were the comedic voice of M*A*S*H for the show's first five seasons (1972\u20131977), Alan Alda and newly promoted Executive Producer Burt Metcalfe became the new dramatic voice of M*A*S*H for Seasons 6\u201311. By the start of Season 8 (1979\u20131980), the writing staff had been completely overhauled, and with the departure of cast members McLean Stevenson, Larry Linville, Wayne Rogers and Gary Burghoff, M*A*S*H displayed a distinctively different feel, consciously moving between comedy and drama. The end of the Vietnam War in 1975 was a significant factor as to why storylines become less political in nature and more character driven. Several episodes experimented by going outside the sitcom format: \"Point of View\" \u2013 shown from the perspective of a soldier with a throat wound \"Dreams\" \u2013 an idea of Alda's, where during a deluge of casualties, members of the 4077 take naps on a rotation basis, allowing the viewer to see the simultaneously lyrical and disturbing dreams \"A War For All Seasons\" \u2013 features a story line that takes place over the course of 1951 \"Life Time\" \u2013 utilizes a real time method of narration [1] Another change was the infusion of story lines based on actual events and medical developments that materialized during the Korean War. Considerable research was done by the producers, including interviews with actual MASH surgeons and personnel to develop story lines rooted in the war itself. Such early 1950s events as the McCarthy era , various sporting events, and the stardom of Marilyn Monroe were all incorporated into various episodes, a trend that continued until the end of the series. [1] While the series remained popular through these changes, it eventually began to run out of creative steam. Korean War doctors regularly contacted producers with experiences that they thought might make for a good storyline, only to learn the idea had previously been used. Harry Morgan admitted that he felt \"the cracks were starting to show\" by season 9 (1980\u20131981). [1] Alda wished to make season 10 (1981\u20131982) M*A*S*H ' s last, but was persuaded by CBS to produce a slightly shortened 11th season, coupled with a farewell movie finale, at CBS' request. In the end, season 11 had 15 episodes (although six had been filmed during season 10 and held over) and a 2 + 1 \u2044 2 -hour movie, which was treated as five episodes and was filmed before the nine remaining episodes. The final episode produced was the penultimately aired episode \"As Time Goes By\". The series finale movie, titled \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\", became the most watched U.S. television broadcast in history at that time, with 106 million viewers. [1] The 4077th consisted of two separate sets. An outdoor set in the mountains near Malibu ( Calabasas , Los Angeles County, California) ( 34\u00b05\u203247.55\u2033N 118\u00b044\u203241.24\u2033W ) was used for most exterior and tent scenes for every season. This was the same location used to shoot the movie, although the number of tents was reduced and there were changes made to the positions of several tents for the TV show. The indoor set, on Stage 09 at Fox Studios in Century City , was used for the indoor scenes for the run of the series. Later, after the indoor set was renovated to permit many of the \"outdoor\" scenes to be filmed there, both sets were used for exterior shooting as script requirements dictated (e.g., night scenes were far easier to film on the sound stage, but scenes at the helicopter pad required using the ranch). Just as the series was wrapping production, a brush fire destroyed most of the outdoor set on October 9, 1982. The fire was written into the final episode \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\" as a forest fire caused by enemy incendiary bombs that forced the 4077th to move out. The Malibu location is today known as Malibu Creek State Park . Formerly called the Century Ranch and owned by 20th Century Fox Studios until the 1980s, the site today is returning to a natural state, and is marked by a rusted Jeep and a Dodge ambulance used in the show. Through the 1990s, the area was occasionally used for television commercial production. On February 23, 2008, series stars Mike Farrell, Loretta Swit and William Christopher (along with producers Gene Reynolds and Burt Metcalfe and M*A*S*H director Charles S. Dubin) reunited at the set to celebrate its partial restoration. The rebuilt signpost is now displayed on weekends, along with tent markers and maps and photos of the set. The state park is open to the public. It was also the location where the film How Green Was My Valley (1941) and the Planet of the Apes television series (1974) were filmed, among many other productions. Much of this location, including the signpost and markers, was thought to have been destroyed in the 2018 Woolsey Fire [6] but subsequently was determined to have survived the fire. [7] The exhibit M*A*S*H: Binding Up the Wounds was at the National Museum of American History from July 30, 1983, through February 3, 1985. The exhibit was extremely popular, drawing more than 17,000 in a single week, a record for any Smithsonian display. [8] On exhibit were The Swamp and Operating Room sets, one of the show's 14 Emmy Awards, early drafts of the pilot script, costumes from the show and other memorabilia. Sets were decorated with props from the show including the iconic signpost, Hawkeye's still and Major Winchester's Webcor tape recorder and phonograph. The exhibit also encouraged visitors to compare the show to real Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals of the Korean and the Vietnam Wars. [9] [10] Series creators Larry Gelbart and Gene Reynolds wanted M*A*S*H broadcast without a laugh track . Though CBS initially rejected the idea, a compromise was reached that allowed for omitting the laughter during operating room scenes if desired. \"We told the network that under no circumstances would we ever can laughter during an OR scene when the doctors were working,\" said Gelbart in 1998. \"It's hard to imagine that 300 people were in there laughing at somebody's guts being sewn up.\" [11] Seasons 1\u20135 utilized a more invasive laugh track; a more subdued audience was employed for Seasons 6\u201311 when the series shifted from sitcom to comedy drama with the departure of Gelbart and Reynolds. Several episodes (\"O.R.\", \"The Bus\", \" Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler? \", \" The Interview \", \"Point of View\", and \" Dreams \" among them) omitted the laugh track altogether; as did almost all of Season 11, including the 135-minute series finale, \" Goodbye, Farewell and Amen \". [12] The laugh track is also omitted from some international and syndicated airings of the show; on one occasion during an airing on BBC2 , the laugh track was accidentally left on, and viewers expressed their displeasure, an apology from the network for the \"technical difficulty\" was later released, as during its original run on BBC2 in the UK, it was shown without the laugh track. UK DVD critics speak poorly of the laugh track, stating \"canned laughter is intrusive at the best of times, but with a programme like M*A*S*H , it's downright unbearable.\" [13] On all released DVDs, both in Region 1 (including the US and Canada) and Region 2 (Europe, including the UK), an option is given to watch the show with or without the laugh track. [14] [15] \"They're a lie,\" said Gelbart in a 1992 interview. \"You're telling an engineer when to push a button to produce a laugh from people who don't exist. It's just so dishonest. The biggest shows when we were on the air were All in the Family and The Mary Tyler Moore Show both of which were taped before a live studio audience where laughter made sense,\" continued Gelbart. \"But our show was a film show \u2013 supposedly shot in the middle of Korea . So the question I always asked the network was, 'Who are these laughing people? Where did they come from?'\" Gelbart persuaded CBS to test the show in private screenings with and without the laugh track. The results showed no measurable difference in the audience's enjoyment. \"So you know what they said?\" Gelbart said. \" 'Since there's no difference, let's leave it alone!' The people who defend laugh tracks have no sense of humor.\" [12] Gelbart summed up the situation by saying, \"I always thought it cheapened the show. The network got their way. They were paying for dinner.\" [16] M*A*S*H was one of the first network series to feature brief partial nudity (notably Gary Burghoff's buttocks in \"The Sniper\", Hawkeye in \"Dear Dad Again\" and \"An Eye for a Tooth\"). [ citation needed ] In his blog, writer Ken Levine revealed that on one occasion, when the cast offered too many nitpicking \"notes\" on a script, his writing partner and he changed the script to a \"cold show\" \u2013 one set during the frigid Korean winter. The cast then had to stand around barrel fires in parkas at the Malibu ranch when the temperatures neared 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). Levine says, \"This happened maybe twice, and we never got a ticky-tack note again.\" [17] Jackie Cooper wrote that Alan Alda \u2013 whom Cooper directed in several episodes during the first two seasons \u2013 concealed what Cooper felt was a lot of hostility toward him, and the two barely spoke to each other by the time Cooper's tenure on the show ended. [18] \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\" was the final episode of M*A*S*H. Special television sets were placed in PX parking lots, auditoriums and day rooms of the U.S. Army in Korea so that military personnel could watch that episode, in spite of 14 hours' time-zone difference with the East Coast of the US. The episode aired on February 28, 1983, and was 2 1 \u2044 2 hours long. The episode got a Nielsen rating of 60.2 and 77 share [20] and according to a New York Times article from 1983, the final episode of M*A*S*H had 125 million viewers. [21] When the M*A*S*H finale aired in 1983, more than 83.3 million homes in the United States had televisions, compared to almost 115 million in February 2010. [22] \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\" broke the record for the highest percentage of homes with television sets to watch a television series. Stories persist that the episode was seen by so many people that the New York City Sanitation/Public Works Department reported the plumbing systems broke down in some parts of the city from so many New Yorkers waiting until the end to use the toilet. Articles copied into Alan Alda's book The Last Days of M*A*S*H include interviews with New York City Sanitation workers citing the spike in water use on that night. According to the interviews at 11:03 pm, EST New York City public works noted the highest water usage at one given time in the city's history. They attributed this to the fact that in the three minutes after the finale ended, around 77 percent of the people of New York City flushed their toilets. [23] These stories have all since been identified as part of an urban legend dating back to the days of the Amos and Andy radio program in the 1930s. [24] The series premiered in the US on September 17, 1972, and ended on February 28, 1983, with the finale, showcased as a television film , titled \" Goodbye, Farewell and Amen \", becoming the most-watched and highest-rated single television episode in US television history at the time, with a record-breaking 125 million viewers (60.2 rating and 77 share), [25] according to the New York Times . [21] It had struggled in its first season and was at risk of being cancelled. [26] In season two, M*A*S*H was placed in a better time slot by CBS (airing after the popular All in the Family , taking the place of Bridget Loves Bernie , which had been canceled after one season despite good ratings due to religious groups protesting the show's premise of an inter-faith marriage between the title characters); the show then became one of the top 10 programs of the year and stayed in the top 20 programs for the rest of its run. [26] It is still broadcast in syndication on various television stations. The series, which depicted events occurring during a three-year war, spanned 256 episodes and lasted 11 seasons. The Korean War lasted 1,128 days, meaning each episode of the series would have averaged almost four and a half days of real time. Many of the stories in the early seasons are based on tales told by real MASH surgeons who were interviewed by the production team. Like the movie, the series was as much an allegory about the Vietnam War (still in progress when the show began) as it was about the Korean War . [27] The episodes \" Abyssinia, Henry \" and \" The Interview \" were ranked number 20 and number 80, respectively, on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time in 1997. [28] In 2002, M*A*S*H was ranked number 25 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time . [29] In February 2008, the series was named the number-one smartest TV show of all time by Jim Werdell, chairman of Mensa International , who said that it \"had smart repartee and was so much more than a comedy\". [30] In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked it as the fifth-best written TV series ever [31] and TV Guide ranked it as the eighth-greatest show of all time. [32] In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked it as the 16th-greatest TV show.

The show was honored with a Peabody Award in 1975 \"for the depth of its humor and the manner in which comedy is used to lift the spirit and, as well, to offer a profound statement on the nature of war.\" M*A*S*H was cited as \"an example of television of high purpose that reveals in universal terms a time and place with such affecting clarity.\" [45] Writers for the show received several Humanitas Prize nominations, with Larry Gelbart winning in 1976, Alan Alda winning in 1980, and the team of David Pollock and Elias Davis winning twice in 1982 and 1983.

This marked the first time the series was made available on an internet platform. As of July 1, 2015, all 11 seasons were available; syndicated versions of hour-long episodes were utilized for streaming, splitting these shows into two parts. [46] In contrast to the DVD sets, the Netflix streams did not have an option for disabling the laugh track on the soundtrack. On April 1, 2016, Netflix' contract to stream the series expired and M*A*S*H was removed from the platform. [47] In July 2017, it was announced that Hulu had acquired online streaming rights for the entire run of M*A*S*H, along with several other 20th Century Fox-owned TV programs. [48] All 256 episodes were added to Hulu beginning June 29, 2018. All episodes were scanned in 1080 HD from the original 35mm negatives and are presented in 16:9 widescreen by cropping the top and bottom off the original 4:3 aspect ratio. All the episodes are also available on Disney+ . [49] The two-season spin-off AfterMASH (1983\u20131985) inherited the parent show's Monday night time slot and featured several of its main characters reunited in a Midwestern hospital after the war. [50] The more successful Trapper John, M.D. (1979\u20131986) took place nearly three decades after the events of M*A*S*H and depicted Trapper John McIntyre as chief of surgery at a San Francisco hospital; [51] its producers argued successfully in court that it was based on the earlier movie rather than the TV series. [52] In an unpurchased television pilot, W*A*L*T*E*R (1984), Walter \"Radar\" O'Reilly joins the St. Louis police force after his farm fails following his return to the U.S. Making M*A*S*H, a documentary special narrated by Mary Tyler Moore that takes viewers behind the production of the season 8 episodes \"Old Soldiers\" and \"Lend a Hand\", was produced for PBS airing on January 21, 1981. The special was later included in the syndicated rerun package, with new narration by producer Michael Hirsch. [53] Three retrospective specials were produced to commemorate the show's 20th, 30th and 50th anniversaries: Memories of M*A*S*H , hosted by Shelley Long and featuring clips from the series and interviews with cast members, was aired by CBS on November 25, 1991. M*A*S*H: 30th Anniversary Reunion , in which the surviving cast members and producers gathered to reminisce, aired on Fox on May 17, 2002. The two-hour broadcast was hosted by Mike Farrell, who also got to interact with the actor he replaced, Wayne Rogers; previously filmed interviews with McLean Stevenson and Larry Linville (who had died in 1996 and 2000, respectively,) were also featured. M*A*S*H: When Television Changed Forever , a one-hour retrospective commemorating the show's 50th anniversary, aired on Reelz on September 13, 2022. It featured new exclusive interviews with cast members Jamie Farr, Mike Farrell and Jeff Maxwell, as well as producers and writers, exploring the series\u2019 popularity and creative firsts. Memories of M*A*S*H and M*A*S*H: 30th Anniversary Reunion are included as bonuses on the Collector's Edition DVD of \"Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen\". Also included is \"M*A*S*H: Television's Serious Sitcom,\" a 2002 episode of A&E channel's Biography program that detailed the show's history. In the late 1980s, the cast had a partial reunion in a series of commercials for IBM products, including personal computers and the AS/400 system. All of the front-billed regulars (with the exceptions of Farrell and Stevenson) appeared in the spots over time. [54] [55] Further reading Gelbart, Larry. (1998).

The Greeks called it Thebai from the Coptic Greek Ta-opet (the name of the great Karnak Temple ) which became 'Thebes' - the name by which it is remembered.\nThe city covered 36 square miles (93 square km) and is located approximately 419 miles (675km) south of modern Cairo. In the modern day, Luxor and Karnak occupy the site of ancient Thebes, and its surrounding area features some of the most important archaeological sites in Egypt such as the Valley of the Kings, the Valley of the Queens, the Ramesseum (temple of Ramesses II ), the temple of Ramesses III, and the grand temple complex of Queen Hatshepsut .\nThebes was prominent by c. 3200 BCE owing largely to the rise in popularity of the cult of the god Amun and was known for its wealth and grandeur. In the 8th century BCE, long after Thebes had seen better days, the Greek poet Homer would still write famously of the city in his Iliad , \"\u2026in Egyptian Thebes the heaps of precious ingots gleam, the hundred-gated Thebes\" and the Greeks would refer to the city as Diospolis Magna ('The Great City of the Gods').\nDuring the Amarna Period (1353-1336 BCE) Thebes was the world's largest city with a population at around 80,000 people. At this same time, Akhenaten moved the capital from Thebes to his custom-built city of Akhetaten to dramatically separate his reign from his predecessors; his son, Tutankhamun , returned the capital to Thebes once he took the throne. The powerful priests of Amun consolidated their power to the point where, during the 20th Dynasty (c. 1190-1069 BCE) they were able to reign as pharoahs from the city.\nThebes continued as an important cult center and place of pilgrimage throughout Egypt's history, even after the capital was moved to Per-Ramesses (near the older city of Avaris) by Ramesses II (1279-1213 BCE). During the Ramessid Period the priests of Amun ruled from Thebes while the pharaoh governed from Per-Ramesses. The city continued to grow in grandeur, especially the Temple of Amun, throughout this time. It was sacked by the Assyrians in 666 BCE, rebuilt, and finally destroyed by Rome in the 1st century CE.\nIn the time of the Old Kingdom (c. 2316-2181 BCE) the city was a minor trading post in Upper Egypt, which was controlled by local clans. During the First Intermediate Period (2181-2040 BCE) the kingship was centered in Memphis until the rulers moved the capital to Herakleopolis. They were just as ineffectual there, however, as they had been in the old capital and this encouraged the local magistrates at Thebes to rise against the central government. The city began to grow more powerful under the leadership of powerful governors such as Intef I (c. 2125 BCE), Mentuhotep I (c. 2115 BCE) and Wahankh Intef II (c. 2112-2063 BCE) who established themselves as royalty. Wahankh Intef II even declared himself the true king of Egypt in opposition to the kings at Herakleopolis.\nThe Theban rulers waged war with the kings of Herakleopolis for supremacy and to unite the land under one rule. Mentuhotep II (2061-2010 BCE), a Theban prince, finally prevailed in c. 2055 BCE defeating the Herakliopolitan kings and uniting Egypt under Theban rule. The victory of Mentuhotep II elevated his gods and, chief among them Amun, above those of Lower Egypt. This deity grew in stature from a local god of fertility to the supreme being and creator of the universe.\nThebes itself was thought to have been formed by the hands of Amun, drawn up from the Nile's waters, just as the primordial mound of the ben-ben rose from the swirling waters of chaos at the creation of the world. In the original creation story, the god Atum or Ra stands upon the ben-ben and begins the work of creation. Amun was a combination of Atum, the creator god, and Ra, the sun god and, as this supreme lord had stood on the first dry earth at the beginning of creation, Thebes was considered his sacred place on earth and, perhaps, the original ben-ben on which he stood at the beginning of time.\nThe veneration of Amun gave rise to the trinity known as the Theban Triad of Amun, Mut, and Khons (also known as Khonsu) who would be worshiped in the city for centuries. Amun represented the sun and the creative force; Mut was his wife symbolized as the sun's rays and the all-seeing eye; Khons was the moon, son of Amun and Mut, known as Khons the Merciful, destroyer of evil spirits, and god of healing. These three deities of Upper Egypt were drawn from the earlier gods Ptah, Sekhmet, and Khons of Lower Egypt who continued to be worshiped under their original names in Lower Egypt but whose attributes were transferred to the Amun, Mut, and Khons, deities of Thebes.\nThe popularity of these gods led directly to Thebes' development, wealth, and status. Construction of the Temple of Karnak, dedicated to the worship of the triad, was begun around this time (c. 2055 BCE), and the temple would continue to grow in size and grandeur over the next 2,000 years as more and more details were added. It remains the largest religious structure ever built in the world. The priests of Amun, who administered the rites of the temple, would eventually grow so powerful they would threaten the authority of the pharaoh and, by the Third Intermediate Period (1069-525 BCE) the priests of Amun would rule Upper Egypt from Thebes.\nThebes grew in status during the Second Intermediate Period (1640-1532 BCE) when the Theban princes stood against the mysterious Hyksos rulers of the Delta region. The Hyksos were a people of unknown origin and ethnicity (though many theories have claimed to be able to identify them) who either invaded Egypt or migrated into the region and steadily took power. They were firmly in control of Egypt by c. 1650 BCE and were regarded by later Egyptian historians as oppressive foreigners even though evidence suggests they introduced many innovations and improvements to the culture (the chariot among the more notable).\nThe Thebans and the Hyksos abided by a truce which forbade hostilities but did not guarantee any amicable relations between the two. The Hyksos would sail past Thebes to trade with the Nubians to the south and the Thebans would ignore them until the Hyksos ruler Apophis (also known as Apepi) insulted Ta'O of Thebes in 1560 BCE and the truce was broken. The Theban armies under Ta'O attacked the Hyksos cities . When Ta'O died in battle his son Kamose took command of the armies and razed their stronghold of Avaris. After his death , his brother Ahmose I took charge and captured the re-built city of Avaris, the Hyksos capital. Ahmose I drove the Hyksos out of Egypt and reclaimed the lands formerly ruled by them. Thebes was celebrated as the city which had liberated the country and was elevated to the position of capital of the country.\nWith Egypt stabilized again, religion and religious centers flourished and none more so than Thebes.\nWith Egypt stabilized again, religion and religious centers flourished and none more so than Thebes. The shrines, temples, public buildings and terraces of Thebes were unsurpassed for their beauty and splendor. It was written that all other cities were judged 'after the pattern of Thebes'. The power and beauty of the great god Amun needed to be reflected fully in the holy city of Thebes and every building project sought to out-do the last in proclaiming the glory of this god.\nThe Tuthmosids of the 18th Dynasty (1550-1307 BCE) lavished their wealth on Thebes and made the Egyptian capital the most glorious city in Egypt. Work continued on the Temple of Karnak, but other temples and monuments rose as well. Most of the greatest monuments of ancient Thebes were either constructed, renovated, or improved upon during this period from c. 1550-1069 BCE with a brief interruption during the Amarna Period.\nDuring the reign of Akhenaten (originally known as Amenhotep IV, 1353-1336 BCE) the priests of Amun at Thebes had become so powerful that they owned more land than the pharaoh and had more wealth than the crown. Scholars believe this situation may have prompted Amenhotep IV to adopt monotheism and proclaim the Aten - the sun disk - the supreme deity. In denying the existence of other gods, Akhenaten effectively cut off the source of the priests' wealth and power. The worship of all other gods except the Aten was outlawed, sacred icons and statuary destroyed, and the temples of Amun closed. Amenhotep IV changed his name to Akhenaten (meaning \"successful for Aten\"), and with his proclamation of the 'one true god, Aten', Thebes was abandoned for El-Amarna and the new city of Akhetaten.\nIf Akhenaten's true motive for religious reformation was to crush the priests of Amun and absorb their power, it worked; there was now only one true God whose will was interpreted by Akhenaten alone. While this new belief worked well for the pharaoh and the royal family, the people of Egypt were highly resentful. The worship of the many traditional gods of Egypt was an important aspect of everyday life throughout the country, and there were many, besides the priests, who lost their jobs once Akhenaten's monotheism became the religion of the land. Every merchant who sold religious artifacts and charms, every craftsman who made them, every scribe who wrote spells or prayers, was unemployed unless they turned their efforts to promoting the pharaoh's religion.\nAfter Akhenaten's death, his son Tutankhaten (\"living image of Aten\") took the throne and changed his name to Tutankhamun (\"living image of Amon\") and restored the old gods and their temples. The capital was returned to Thebes, and a renewed interest in building projects began, perhaps to make amends to the gods who had been neglected, which produced even more glorious temples and shrines. The western shore of Thebes became a vast and beautiful necropolis in the years and centuries following and the mortuary complexes at Deir-El Bahri (like the one of Queen Hatshepsut) were awe-inspiring in their symmetry and grandeur.\nTutankhamun was succeeded by his general Horemheb (1320-1292 BCE), who believed that the old gods of Egypt were angered by the heretic king's insult to their honor. He encouraged building projects at Thebes (and elsewhere) and destroyed any iconography related to the worship of Aten or the royal family of the Amarna Period. He named Ramesses I as his successor who founded the 19th Dynasty.\nRamesses II moved the capital from Thebes to a new site near the city of Avaris called Per-Ramesses where he built a grand palace to distinguish his reign from any which preceeded it. On a simpler level, he may have done this simply because there was nothing of significance he could add to the grandeur of Thebes and he was a pharaoh who needed to make an impression. Avaris now grew in prosperity and beauty as Thebes declined in power but this was a temporary situation. The priests of Amun, able to do as they pleased so far removed from the sphere of the pharaohs at Avaris, acquired significant amounts of land through which they amassed more and more wealth and greater power. By the time of the Ramessid Period they were ruling Thebes as pharaohs and the actual rulers at Avaris could do nothing about it.\nThe city declined during the Third Intermediate Period but still was impressive. The continued worship of the popular Amun and the legendary beauty of the city guaranteed Thebes a special place in the hearts of the Egyptians. The Nubian pharaoh Tatanami made Thebes his capital in the 7th century BCE, linking himself to the glory of the past, but his reign was short-lived. The Assyrian king Ashurbanipal invaded Egypt in 667 BCE and a second time in 666 BCE, completing the work he had left unfinished earlier, and sacked Thebes, driving Tatanami out of Egypt and leaving the city in ruins.\nThe Assyrians decreed that Thebes should be restored and rebuilt by Egyptian labor to compensate for their resistance to Assyrian rule. The city gradually recovered and worship of Amon continued there until the coming of Rome when it was destroyed by the Roman army in the 1st century CE. Afterwards it remained in ruins, populated only by a few people inhabiting the buildings which had been left vacant after the Romans moved on.\nBy the time of the historian Strabo (c. 63 BCE - 24 CE) the city was no more than a tourist attraction of ancient ruins and empty streets. Thebes retained its legendary status, however, and continued to be venerated by those who remembered its former glory. As the site of the Valley of the Kings, the Valley of the Queens, the great Temple of Karnak, and those of Luxor, Thebes continues as a vital link to ancient Egyptian culture and the vitality of its history into the present day.", "source_raw_text": "Thebes was the capital of Egypt during the period of the New Kingdom (c.1570-c.1069 BCE) and became an important center of worship of the god Amun (also known as Amon or Amen, a combination of the earlier gods Atum and Ra). Its sacred name was P-Amen or Pa-Amen meaning \"the abode of Amen\". It was also known to the Egyptians as Wase or Wo'se (the city ) and Usast or Waset (the southern city) and was built on either side of the Nile River with the main city on the east bank and the vast necropolis on the west.

But it also engrained an apartheid framed education system that was predicted to impede the advancement of black children.

This act gave the South African government the power to structure the education of Native South African children, separate from White South African children. This law was intended to organize a federal education system that would ensure that all students received an education. But it also engrained an apartheid framed education system that was predicted to impede the advancement of black children. Many ANC members, African parents, teachers, and ministers were unhappy with the way that the Act was created to educate black children in preparation for the jobs that white oppressors deemed appropriate for their social class. By November 1953, members of the African National Congress (ANC) were speaking out against the Act. The members of the educational institutions themselves also took action. The Act required that all schools hand their operation over to the South African Government within two years\u2019 time unless they could secure outside sources of aid.

Most children, however, did not attend these schools. In 1949 the government appointed a commission, headed by anthropologist W.W.M.

The Eiselen Commission Report (1951) urged the government to take charge of education for Black South Africans in order to make it part of a general socioeconomic plan for the country.

The prescriptions of the commission were generally followed by the Bantu Education Act.\nUnder the act, the Department of Native Affairs, headed by Hendrik Verwoerd , was made responsible for the education of Black South Africans; in 1958 the Department of Bantu Education was established. The act required Black children to attend the government schools. Teaching was to take place in the students\u2019 native tongue, though the syllabus included classes in English and Afrikaans .

It was part of the government\u2019s system of apartheid , which sanctioned racial segregation and discrimination against nonwhites in the country. From about the 1930s the vast majority of schools serving Black students in South Africa were run by missions and often operated with state aid. Most children, however, did not attend these schools. In 1949 the government appointed a commission, headed by anthropologist W.W.M. Eiselen, to study and make recommendations for the education of native South Africans. The Eiselen Commission Report (1951) urged the government to take charge of education for Black South Africans in order to make it part of a general socioeconomic plan for the country. In addition, the report stated that the schooling should be tailored toward the needs and values of the cultures of the communities in which the schools were located. The prescriptions of the commission were generally followed by the Bantu Education Act. Under the act, the Department of Native Affairs, headed by Hendrik Verwoerd , was made responsible for the education of Black South Africans; in 1958 the Department of Bantu Education was established. The act required Black children to attend the government schools. Teaching was to take place in the students\u2019 native tongue, though the syllabus included classes in English and Afrikaans .

T. L. O. , 469 U.S. 325 (1985), is a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States which established the standards by which a public school official can search a student in a school environment without a search warrant , and to what extent. The case centered around a student at Piscataway High School in Middlesex County, New Jersey , known then only by her initials T. L. O. , [a] who was searched for contraband after she was caught smoking in a school bathroom. She was sent to the principal's office, where the vice principal searched her purse and found marijuana , drug paraphernalia , and documentation of drug sales. She was expelled from the school and charged by police for the paraphernalia found in the search, but fought the charges on the basis that the search of her purse violated the Fourth Amendment 's prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure . The New Jersey Superior Court affirmed the constitutionality of the search, but the Supreme Court of New Jersey reversed, holding that the search of her purse was unreasonable. On appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court held that the Fourth Amendment applies to searches conducted by school officials in a school setting. However, school officials do not need to have probable cause nor obtain a warrant before searching a student. Instead, in order for a search to be justified, school officials must have \" reasonable suspicion \" that the student has violated either the law or school rules. In a 6\u20133 decision delivered by Justice Byron White , the Court ruled that the school's search of T. L. O.'s purse was constitutional, setting a new precedent for school searches and student privacy. On March 7, 1980, a teacher at Piscataway High School in Piscataway, New Jersey discovered two 14-year-old freshmen smoking in the girl's bathroom, in violation of school rules. [1] While students were permitted to smoke in designated smoking areas, the bathroom was not one of them. [3] The two were sent to principal's office, where they were questioned by vice principal Theodore Choplick. One of the students admitted to smoking and was assigned to complete a three-day smoking clinic before being sent back to class. [4] The other student, whose initials were T. L. O. , denied ever having smoked in her life. [5] Choplick brought T. L. O. into his private office and demanded to see her purse. [b] Upon searching it, Choplick found a pack of Marlboro cigarettes and rolling paper in plain view . [10] These findings prompted Choplick to conduct a more thorough search of T. L. O.'s purse, revealing a small amount of marijuana , a tobacco pipe , an index card with the names of students who owed her money, and two letters linking her to dealing marijuana. [11] Choplick notified the police and T. L. O.'s mother, who both arrived at the school shortly after. [11] A police officer requested for T. L. O. to be brought to the police station for questioning, and T. L. O.'s mother drove her from the school to the police station. [4] During questioning, T. L. O. admitted to selling marijuana on school property. [12] She was convicted of dealing and use of illicit drugs. She was expelled from the school and fined $1,000. She was charged as a juvenile for the drugs and paraphernalia found in the search. Oral arguments were initially heard on March 28, 1984.

This is similar, but not identical, to the standard the law places on police searches. It is a somewhat lowered standard, replacing \"probable cause\" with \"reasonable suspicion.\" Once it had established the standard, the Supreme Court had to apply it to T.L.O.'s case. Did the school violate T.L.O.'s rights when it searched her purse? This is where the justices disagreed. According to the majority, the school's searches met the above standard of reasonableness. Justice Powell, with Justice O'Connor, agreed with the majority opinion. However, they wrote separately to emphasize that students have less of a privacy expectation in school than others. Justice Brennan, with whom Justice Marshall joined, dissented in part. While Justices Brennan and Marshall agreed that students have Fourth Amendment protections, they disagreed with the new standard for searches the majority created. \"In adopting this unclear, unprecedented, and unnecessary departure from generally applicable Fourth Amendment standards, the Court carves out a broad exception to standards that this Court has developed over years of considering Fourth Amendment problems,\" Justice Brennan wrote. Instead, he would have held that the vice principal needed probable cause to search T.L.O.'s purse. In holding the school to the higher and more established probable cause standard, Justices Brennan and Marshall would have upheld the New Jersey Supreme Court's decision finding that the school violated T.L.O.'s Fourth Amendment rights. Justice Stevens also wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Marshall and in part by Justice Brennan, holding that the Supreme Court should have limited its decision to whether the exclusionary rule applied in this case. When it first appealed the case to the Supreme Court, the state of New Jersey first only asked the Supreme Court to decide whether the exclusionary rule applied to the decision the New Jersey Supreme Court made. The question of T.L.O.'s Fourth Amendment rights came up later and was the reason the Supreme Court heard oral arguments twice in this case. Justice Stevens would have held the exclusionary rule applied to school searches and left it at that. However, he added a section on the majority's decision, writing that students have the same expectation of privacy for their personal belongings that anyone else has. In other words, Justice Stevens also disagreed with the majority's newly created standard for the lawfulness of school searches. As a result of the decision, school searches of students are very fact-dependent. Courts apply a somewhat different standard than police searches to determine whether the school was justified in conducting a search. As noted above, this question is particularly relevant today, when students carry around significant amounts of personal information in their pocket in the form of smartphones. As one hypothetical, would a school be justified in searching a student's text messages in similar circumstances as T.L.O.'s? While the question to that hypothetical remains unclear, the standard courts would use to determine that question would derive from the standard set in New Jersey v. T.L.O.

by the New Jersey Supreme Court for determining the legality of school searches was appropriate and that the court had correctly applied that standard; the State contended only that the remedial

When respondent, in response to the Assistant Vice Principal's questioning, denied that she had been smoking and claimed that she did not smoke at all, the Assistant Vice Principal demanded to see her purse. Upon opening the purse, he found a pack of cigarettes and also noticed a package of cigarette rolling papers that are commonly associated with the use of marihuana. He then proceeded to search the purse thoroughly and found some marihuana, a pipe, plastic bags, a fairly substantial amount of money, an index card containing a list of students who owed respondent money, and two letters that implicated her in marihuana dealing. Thereafter, the State brought delinquency charges against respondent in the Juvenile Court, which, after denying respondent's motion to suppress the evidence found in her purse, held that the Fourth Amendment applied to searches by school officials, but that the search in question was a reasonable one, and adjudged respondent to be a delinquent. The Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court affirmed the trial court's finding that there had been no Fourth Amendment violation, but vacated the adjudication of delinquency and remanded on other grounds. The New Jersey Supreme Court reversed and ordered the suppression of the evidence found in respondent's purse, holding that the search of the purse was unreasonable.\nHeld:\n1. The Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures applies to searches conducted by public school officials, and is not limited to searches carried out by law enforcement officers. Nor are school officials exempt from the Amendment's dictates by virtue of the special nature of their authority over schoolchildren. In carrying out searches and other functions pursuant to disciplinary policies mandated by state statutes, school officials act as representatives of the State, not merely as surrogates for the parents of students, and they cannot claim the parents immunity from the Fourth Amendment's strictures. Pp. 469 U. S. 333 -337.\n2. Schoolchildren have legitimate expectations of privacy. They may find it necessary to carry with them a variety of legitimate, noncontraband items, and there is no reason to conclude that they have necessarily waived all rights to privacy in such items by bringing them onto school grounds. But striking the balance between schoolchildren's legitimate expectations of privacy and the school's equally legitimate need to maintain an environment in which learning can take place requires some easing of the restrictions to which searches by public authorities are ordinarily subject. Thus, school officials need not obtain a warrant before searching a student who is under their authority. Moreover, school officials need not be held subject to the requirement that searches be based on probable cause to believe that the subject of the search has violated or is violating the law. Rather, the legality of a search of a student should depend simply on the reasonableness, under all the circumstances, of the search. Determining the reasonableness of any search involves a determination of whether the search was justified at its inception and whether, as conducted, it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the interference in the first place. Under ordinary circumstances, the search of a student by a school official will be justified at its inception where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school. And such a search will be permissible in its scope when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search, and not excessively intrusive in light of the student's age and sex and the nature of the infraction. Pp. 469 U. S. 337 -343.\n3. Under the above standard, the search in this case was not unreasonable for Fourth Amendment purposes. First, the initial search for cigarettes was reasonable. The report to the Assistant Vice Principal that respondent had been smoking warranted a reasonable suspicion that she had cigarettes in her purse, and thus the search was justified despite the fact that the cigarettes, if found, would constitute \"mere evidence\" of a violation of the no-smoking rule. Second, the discovery of the rolling papers then gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that respondent was carrying marihuana as well as cigarettes in her purse, and this suspicion justified the further exploration that turned up more evidence of drug-related activities.

Our consideration of the proper application of the Fourth Amendment to the public schools, however, has led us to conclude that the search that gave rise to\nthe case now before us did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Accordingly, we here address only the questions of the proper standard for assessing the legality of searches conducted by public school officials and the application of that standard to the facts of this case.\nI\nOn March 7, 1980, a teacher at Piscataway High School in Middlesex County, N.J. discovered two girls smoking in a lavatory. One of the two girls was the respondent T.L.O, who at that time was a 14-year-old high school freshman. Because smoking in the lavatory was a violation of a school rule, the teacher took the two girls to the Principal's office, where they met with Assistant Vice Principal Theodore Choplick. In response to questioning by Mr. Choplick, T.L.O's companion admitted that she had violated the rule. T.L.O, however, denied that she had been smoking in the lavatory and claimed that she did not smoke at all.\nMr. Choplick asked T.L.O to come into his private office and demanded to see her purse. Opening the purse, he found a pack of cigarettes, which he removed from the purse and held before T.L.O as he accused her of having lied to him. As he reached into the purse for the cigarettes, Mr. Choplick also noticed a package of cigarette rolling papers. In his experience, possession of rolling papers by high school students was closely associated with the use of marihuana. Suspecting that a closer examination of the purse might yield further evidence of drug use, Mr. Choplick proceeded to search the purse thoroughly. The search revealed a small amount of marihuana, a pipe, a number of empty plastic bags, a substantial quantity of money in one-dollar bills, an index card that appeared to be a list of students who owed T.L.O money, and two letters that implicated T.L.O in marihuana dealing.\nMr. Choplick notified T.L.O's mother and the police, and turned the evidence of drug dealing over to the police. At\nthe request of the police, T.L.O's mother took her daughter to police headquarters, where T.L.O confessed that she had been selling marihuana at the high school. On the basis of the confession and the evidence seized by Mr. Choplick, the State brought delinquency charges against T.L.O in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of Middlesex County. [ Footnote 1 ] Contending that Mr. Choplick's search of her purse violated the Fourth Amendment, T.L.O moved to suppress the evidence found in her purse as well as her confession, which, she argued, was tainted by the allegedly unlawful search. The Juvenile Court denied the motion to suppress. State ex rel. T.L.O., 178 N.J.Super. 329, 428 A.2d 1327 (1980). Although the court concluded that the Fourth Amendment did apply to searches carried out by school officials, it held that\n\"a school official may properly conduct a search of a student's person if the official has a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is in the process of being committed, or reasonable cause to believe that the search is necessary to maintain school discipline or enforce school policies.\"\nId. at 341, 428 A.2d at 1333 (emphasis in original).\nApplying this standard, the court concluded that the search conducted by Mr. Choplick was a reasonable one. The initial decision to open the purse was justified by Mr. Choplick's well-founded suspicion that T.L.O had violated the rule forbidding smoking in the lavatory. Once the purse\nwas open, evidence of marihuana violations was in plain view, and Mr. Choplick was entitled to conduct a thorough search to determine the nature and extent of T.L.O's drug-related activities. Id. at 343, 428 A.2d at 1334. Having denied the motion to suppress, the court on March 23, 1981, found T.L.O. to be a delinquent and on January 8, 1982, sentenced her to a year's probation.\nOn appeal from the final judgment of the Juvenile Court, a divided Appellate Division affirmed the trial court's finding that there had been no Fourth Amendment violation, but vacated the adjudication of delinquency and remanded for a determination whether T.L.O. had knowingly and voluntarily waived her Fifth Amendment rights before confessing. State ex rel. T.L.O., 185 N.J.Super. 279, 448 A.2d 493 (1982). T.L.O. appealed the Fourth Amendment ruling, and the Supreme Court of New Jersey reversed the judgment of the Appellate Division and ordered the suppression of the evidence found in T.L.O.'s purse. State ex rel. T.L.O., 94 N.J. 331, 463 A.2d 934 (1983).\nThe New Jersey Supreme Court agreed with the lower courts that the Fourth Amendment applies to searches conducted by school officials. The court also rejected the State of New Jersey's argument that the exclusionary rule should not be employed to prevent the use in juvenile proceedings of evidence unlawfully seized by school officials. Declining to consider whether applying the rule to the fruits of searches by school officials would have any deterrent value, the court held simply that the precedents of this Court establish that \"if an official search violates constitutional rights, the evidence is not admissible in criminal proceedings.\" Id. at 341, 463 A.2d at 939 (footnote omitted).\nWith respect to the question of the legality of the search before it, the court agreed with the Juvenile Court that a warrantless search by a school official does not violate the Fourth Amendment so long as the official\n\"has reasonable grounds to believe that a student possesses evidence of illegal\nactivity or activity that would interfere with school discipline and order.\"\nId. at 346, 463 A.2d at 941-942. However, the court, with two justices dissenting, sharply disagreed with the Juvenile Court's conclusion that the search of the purse was reasonable. According to the majority, the contents of T.L.O.'s purse had no bearing on the accusation against T.L.O., for possession of cigarettes (as opposed to smoking them in the lavatory) did not violate school rules, and a mere desire for evidence that would impeach T.L.O.'s claim that she did not smoke cigarettes could not justify the search. Moreover, even if a reasonable suspicion that T.L.O. had cigarettes in her purse would justify a search, Mr. Choplick had no such suspicion, as no one had furnished him with any specific information that there were cigarettes in the purse. Finally, leaving aside the question whether Mr. Choplick was justified in opening the purse, the court held that the evidence of drug use that he saw inside did not justify the extensive \"rummaging\" through T.L.O.'s papers and effects that followed. Id. at 347, 463 A.2d at 942-943.\nWe granted the State of New Jersey's petition for certiorari. 464 U.S. 991 (1983). Although the State had argued in the Supreme Court of New Jersey that the search of T.L.O.'s purse did not violate the Fourth Amendment, the petition for certiorari raised only the question whether the exclusionary rule should operate to bar consideration in juvenile delinquency proceedings of evidence unlawfully seized by a school official without the involvement of law enforcement officers. When this case was first argued last Term, the State conceded for the purpose of argument that the standard devised by the New Jersey Supreme Court for determining the legality of school searches was appropriate and that the court had correctly applied that standard; the State contended only that the remedial purposes of the exclusionary rule were not well served by applying it to searches conducted by public authorities not primarily engaged in law enforcement.\nAlthough we originally granted certiorari to decide the issue of the appropriate remedy in juvenile court proceedings for unlawful school searches, our doubts regarding the wisdom of deciding that question in isolation from the broader question of what limits, if any, the Fourth Amendment places on the activities of school authorities prompted us to order reargument on that question. [ Footnote 2 ] Having heard argument on\nthe legality of the search of T.L.O.'s purse, we are satisfied that the search did not violate the Fourth Amendment. [ Footnote 3 ]\nII\nIn determining whether the search at issue in this case violated the Fourth Amendment, we are faced initially with the question whether that Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures applies to searches conducted by public school officials. We hold that it does.\nIt is now beyond dispute that\n\"the Federal Constitution, by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures by state officers.\"\nElkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206 , 364 U. S. 213 (1960); accord, Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961); Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25 (1949). Equally indisputable is the proposition that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the rights of students against encroachment by public school officials:\n\"The Fourteenth Amendment, as now applied to the States, protects the citizen against the State itself and all of its creatures -- Boards of Education not excepted. These have, of course, important, delicate, and highly discretionary functions, but none that they may not perform within the limits of the Bill of Rights. That they are educating the young for citizenship is reason for scrupulous protection of Constitutional freedoms of the individual, if we are not to strangle the free mind at its source and teach youth to discount important principles of our government as mere platitudes.\"\nWest Virginia State Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624 , 319 U. S. 637 (1943).\nThese two propositions -- that the Fourth Amendment applies to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the actions of public school officials are subject to the limits placed on state action by the Fourteenth Amendment -- might appear sufficient to answer the suggestion that the Fourth Amendment does not proscribe unreasonable searches by school officials. On reargument, however, the State of New Jersey has argued that the history of the Fourth Amendment indicates that the Amendment was intended to regulate only searches and seizures carried out by law enforcement officers; accordingly, although public school officials are concededly state agents for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fourth Amendment creates no rights enforceable against them. [ Footnote 4 ]\nIt may well be true that the evil toward which the Fourth Amendment was primarily directed was the resurrection of the pre-Revolutionary practice of using general warrants or \"writs of assistance\" to authorize searches for contraband by officers of the Crown. See United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1 , 433 U. S. 7 -8 (1977); Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616 , 116 U. S. 624 -629 (1886). But this Court has never limited the Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures to operations conducted by the police. Rather, the Court has long spoken of the Fourth Amendment's strictures as restraints imposed upon \"governmental action\" -- that is, \"upon the activities of sovereign authority.\" Burdeau v. McDowell, 256 U. S. 465 , 256 U. S. 475 (1921). Accordingly, we have held the Fourth Amendment applicable to the activities of civil as well as criminal authorities: building inspectors, see Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U. S. 523 , 387 U. S. 528 (1967), Occupational Safety and Health Act inspectors, see Marshall v. Barlow's, Inc., 436 U. S. 307 , 436 U. S. 312 -313 (1978), and even firemen entering privately owned premises to battle a fire, see Michigan v. Tyler, 436 U. S. 499 , 436 U. S. 506 (1978), are all subject to the restraints imposed by the Fourth Amendment. As we observed in Camara v. Municipal Court, supra,\n\"[t]he basic purpose of this Amendment, as recognized in countless decisions of this Court, is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.\"\n387 U.S. at 387 U. S. 528 . Because the individual's interest in privacy and personal security \"suffers whether the government's motivation is to investigate violations of criminal laws or breaches of other statutory or regulatory standards,\" Marshall v. Barlow's, Inc., supra, at 436 U. S. 312 -313, it would be \"anomalous to say that the individual and his private property are fully protected by the Fourth Amendment only when the individual is suspected of criminal behavior.\" Camara v. Municipal Court, supra, at 387 U. S. 530 .\nNotwithstanding the general applicability of the Fourth Amendment to the activities of civil authorities, a few courts have concluded that school officials are exempt from the dictates of the Fourth Amendment by virtue of the special nature of their authority over schoolchildren. See, e.g., R.C.M. v. State, 660 S.W.2d 552 (Tex.App.1983). Teachers and school administrators, it is said, act in loco parentis in their dealings with students: their authority is that of the parent, not the State, and is therefore not subject to the limits of the Fourth Amendment. Ibid.\nSuch reasoning is in tension with contemporary reality and the teachings of this Court. We have held school officials subject to the commands of the First Amendment, see Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U. S. 503 (1969), and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, see Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565 (1975). If school authorities are state actors for purposes of the constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression and due process, it is difficult to understand why they should be deemed to be exercising parental rather than public authority when conducting searches of their students. More generally, the Court has recognized that \"the concept of parental delegation\" as a source of school authority is not entirely \"consonant with compulsory education laws.\" Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651 , 430 U. S. 662 (1977). Today's public school officials do not merely exercise authority voluntarily conferred on them by individual parents; rather, they act in furtherance of publicly mandated educational and disciplinary policies. See, e.g., the opinion in State ex rel. T.L.O., 94 N.J. at 343, 463 A.2d at 934, 940, describing the New Jersey statutes regulating school disciplinary policies and establishing the authority of school officials over their students. In carrying out searches and other disciplinary functions pursuant to such policies, school officials act as representatives of the State, not merely as surrogates for the parents, and they\ncannot claim the parents' immunity from the strictures of the Fourth Amendment.\nIII\nTo hold that the Fourth Amendment applies to searches conducted by school authorities is only to begin the inquiry into the standards governing such searches. Although the underlying command of the Fourth Amendment is always that searches and seizures be reasonable, what is reasonable depends on the context within which a search takes place. The determination of the standard of reasonableness governing any specific class of searches requires \"balancing the need to search against the invasion which the search entails.\" Camara v. Municipal Court, supra, at 387 U. S. 536 -537. On one side of the balance are arrayed the individual's legitimate expectations of privacy and personal security; on the other, the government's need for effective methods to deal with breaches of public order.\nWe have recognized that even a limited search of the person is a substantial invasion of privacy. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 , 392 U. S. 24 -25 (1967). We have also recognized that searches of closed items of personal luggage are intrusions on protected privacy interests, for \"the Fourth Amendment provides protection to the owner of every container that conceals its contents from plain view.\" United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798 , 456 U. S. 822 -823 (1982). A search of a child's person or of a closed purse or other bag carried on her person, [ Footnote 5 ] no less\nthan a similar search carried out on an adult, is undoubtedly a severe violation of subjective expectations of privacy.\nOf course, the Fourth Amendment does not protect subjective expectations of privacy that are unreasonable or otherwise \"illegitimate.\" See, e.g., Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517 (1984); Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448 U. S. 98 (1980). To receive the protection of the Fourth Amendment, an expectation of privacy must be one that society is \"prepared to recognize as legitimate.\" Hudson v. Palmer, supra, at 468 U. S. 526 . The State of New Jersey has argued that, because of the pervasive supervision to which children in the schools are necessarily subject, a child has virtually no legitimate expectation of privacy in articles of personal property \"unnecessarily\" carried into a school. This argument has two factual premises: (1) the fundamental incompatibility of expectations of privacy with the maintenance of a sound educational environment; and (2) the minimal interest of the child in bringing any items of personal property into the school. Both premises are severely flawed.\nAlthough this Court may take notice of the difficulty of maintaining discipline in the public schools today, the situation is not so dire that students in the schools may claim no legitimate expectations of privacy. We have recently recognized that the need to maintain order in a prison is such that prisoners retain no legitimate expectations of privacy in their cells, but it goes almost without saying that \"[t]he prisoner and the schoolchild stand in wholly different circumstances, separated by the harsh facts of criminal conviction and incarceration.\" Ingraham v. Wright, supra, at 430 U. S. 669 . We are not\nyet ready to hold that the schools and the prisons need be equated for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.\nNor does the State's suggestion that children have no legitimate need to bring personal property into the schools seem well anchored in reality. Students at a minimum must bring to school not only the supplies needed for their studies, but also keys, money, and the necessaries of personal hygiene and grooming. In addition, students may carry on their persons or in purses or wallets such nondisruptive yet highly personal items as photographs, letters, and diaries. Finally, students may have perfectly legitimate reasons to carry with them articles of property needed in connection with extracurricular or recreational activities. In short, schoolchildren may find it necessary to carry with them a variety of legitimate, noncontraband items, and there is no reason to conclude that they have necessarily waived all rights to privacy in such items merely by bringing them onto school grounds.\nAgainst the child's interest in privacy must be set the substantial interest of teachers and administrators in maintaining discipline in the classroom and on school grounds. Maintaining order in the classroom has never been easy, but in recent years, school disorder has often taken particularly ugly forms: drug use and violent crime in the schools have become major social problems. See generally 1 NIE, U.S. Dept. of Health, Education and Welfare, Violent Schools -- Safe Schools: The Safe School Study Report to the Congress (1978). Even in schools that have been spared the most severe disciplinary problems, the preservation of order and a proper educational environment requires close supervision of schoolchildren, as well as the enforcement of rules against conduct that would be perfectly permissible if undertaken by an adult. \"Events calling for discipline are frequent occurrences and sometimes require immediate, effective action.\" Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. at 419 U. S. 580 . Accordingly, we have recognized\nthat maintaining security and order in the schools requires a certain degree of flexibility in school disciplinary procedures, and we have respected the value of preserving the informality of the student-teacher relationship. See id. at 419 U. S. 582 -583; Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. at 430 U. S. 680 -682.\nHow, then, should we strike the balance between the schoolchild's legitimate expectations of privacy and the school's equally legitimate need to maintain an environment in which learning can take place? It is evident that the school setting requires some easing of the restrictions to which searches by public authorities are ordinarily subject. The warrant requirement, in particular, is unsuited to the school environment: requiring a teacher to obtain a warrant before searching a child suspected of an infraction of school rules (or of the criminal law) would unduly interfere with the maintenance of the swift and informal disciplinary procedures needed in the schools. Just as we have in other cases dispensed with the warrant requirement when \"the burden of obtaining a warrant is likely to frustrate the governmental purpose behind the search,\" Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. at 387 U. S. 532 -533, we hold today that school officials need not obtain a warrant before searching a student who is under their authority.\nThe school setting also requires some modification of the level of suspicion of illicit activity needed to justify a search. Ordinarily, a search -- even one that may permissibly be carried out without a warrant -- must be based upon \"probable cause\" to believe that a violation of the law has occurred. See, e.g., Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U. S. 266 , 413 U. S. 273 (1973); Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40 , 392 U. S. 62 -66 (1968). However, \"probable cause\" is not an irreducible requirement of a valid search. The fundamental command of the Fourth Amendment is that searches and seizures be reasonable, and although\n\"both the concept of probable cause and the requirement of a warrant bear on the reasonableness of a search, . . . in certain limited circumstances neither is required.\"\nJ., concurring). Thus, we have in a number of cases recognized the legality of searches and seizures based on suspicions that, although \"reasonable,\" do not rise to the level of probable cause. See, e.g., Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968); United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U. S. 873 , 422 U. S. 881 (195); Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S. 648 , 440 U. S. 654 -655 (1979); United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543 (1976); cf. Camara v. Municipal Court, supra, at 387 U. S. 534 -539. Where a careful balancing of governmental and private interests suggests that the public interest is best served by a Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness that stops short of probable cause, we have not hesitated to adopt such a standard.\nWe join the majority of courts that have examined this issue [ Footnote 6 ] in concluding that the accommodation of the privacy interests of schoolchildren with the substantial need of teachers and administrators for freedom to maintain order in the schools does not require strict adherence to the requirement that searches be based on probable cause to believe that the subject of the search has violated or is violating the law. Rather, the legality of a search of a student should depend simply on the reasonableness, under all the circumstances, of the search. Determining the reasonableness of any search involves a twofold inquiry: first, one must consider \"whether the . . . action was justified at its inception,\" Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. at 392 U. S. 20 ; second, one must determine whether the search as actually conducted \"was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place,\" ibid. Under ordinary circumstances, a search of a student by a teacher or other school official [ Footnote 7 ] will be\n\"justified at its inception\" when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school. [ Footnote 8 ] Such a search will be permissible in its scope when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction. [ Footnote 9 ]\nThis standard will, we trust, neither unduly burden the efforts of school authorities to maintain order in their schools\nnor authorize unrestrained intrusions upon the privacy of schoolchildren. By focusing attention on the question of reasonableness, the standard will spare teachers and school administrators the necessity of schooling themselves in the niceties of probable cause and permit them to regulate their conduct according to the dictates of reason and common sense. At the same time, the reasonableness standard should ensure that the interests of students will be invaded no more than is necessary to achieve the legitimate end of preserving order in the schools.\nIV\nThere remains the question of the legality of the search in this case. We recognize that the \"reasonable grounds\" standard applied by the New Jersey Supreme Court in its consideration of this question is not substantially different from the standard that we have adopted today. Nonetheless, we believe that the New Jersey court's application of that standard to strike down the search of T.L.O.'s purse reflects a somewhat crabbed notion of reasonableness. Our review of the facts surrounding the search leads us to conclude that the search was in no sense unreasonable for Fourth Amendment purposes. [ Footnote 10 ]\nThe incident that gave rise to this case actually involved two separate searches, with the first -- the search for cigarettes -- providing the suspicion that gave rise to the second\n-- the search for marihuana. Although it is the fruits of the second search that are at issue here, the validity of the search for marihuana must depend on the reasonableness of the initial search for cigarettes, as there would have been no reason to suspect that T.L.O. possessed marihuana had the first search not taken place. Accordingly, it is to the search for cigarettes that we first turn our attention.\nThe New Jersey Supreme Court pointed to two grounds for its holding that the search for cigarettes was unreasonable. First, the court observed that possession of cigarettes was not in itself illegal or a violation of school rules. Because the contents of T.L.O.'s purse would therefore have \"no direct bearing on the infraction\" of which she was accused (smoking in a lavatory where smoking was prohibited), there was no reason to search her purse. [ Footnote 11 ] Second, even assuming that a search of T.L.O.'s purse might under some circumstances be reasonable in light of the accusation made against T.L.O., the New Jersey court concluded that Mr. Choplick in this particular case had no reasonable grounds to suspect that T.L.O. had cigarettes in her purse. At best, according\nto the court, Mr. Choplick had \"a good hunch.\" 94 N.J. at 347, 463 A.2d at 942.\nBoth these conclusions are implausible. T.L.O. had been accused of smoking, and had denied the accusation in the strongest possible terms when she stated that she did not smoke at all. Surely it cannot be said that under these circumstances, T.L.O.'s possession of cigarettes would be irrelevant to the charges against her or to her response to those charges. T.L.O.'s possession of cigarettes, once it was discovered, would both corroborate the report that she had been smoking and undermine the credibility of her defense to the charge of smoking. To be sure, the discovery of the cigarettes would not prove that T.L.O. had been smoking in the lavatory; nor would it, strictly speaking, necessarily be inconsistent with her claim that she did not smoke at all. But it is universally recognized that evidence, to be relevant to an inquiry, need not conclusively prove the ultimate fact in issue, but only have\n\"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\"\nFed.Rule Evid. 401. The relevance of T.L.O.'s possession of cigarettes to the question whether she had been smoking and to the credibility of her denial that she smoked supplied the necessary \"nexus\" between the item searched for and the infraction under investigation. See Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294 , 387 U. S. 306 -307 (1967). Thus, if Mr. Choplick in fact had a reasonable suspicion that T.L.O. had cigarettes in her purse, the search was justified despite the fact that the cigarettes, if found, would constitute \"mere evidence\" of a violation. Ibid.\nOf course, the New Jersey Supreme Court also held that Mr. Choplick had no reasonable suspicion that the purse would contain cigarettes. This conclusion is puzzling. A teacher had reported that T.L.O. was smoking in the lavatory. Certainly this report gave Mr. Choplick reason to suspect that T.L.O. was carrying cigarettes with her; and\nif she did have cigarettes, her purse was the obvious place in which to find them. Mr. Choplick's suspicion that there were cigarettes in the purse was not an \"inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch,'\" Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. at 392 U. S. 27 ; rather, it was the sort of \"common-sense conclusio[n] about human behavior\" upon which \"practical people\" -- including government officials -- are entitled to rely. United States v. Cortez, 449 U. S. 411 , 449 U. S. 418 (1981). Of course, even if the teacher's report were true, T.L.O. might not have had a pack of cigarettes with her; she might have borrowed a cigarette from someone else or have been sharing a cigarette with another student. But the requirement of reasonable suspicion is not a requirement of absolute certainty: \"sufficient probability, not certainty, is the touchstone of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment. . . .\" Hill v. California, 401 U. S. 797 , 401 U. S. 804 (1971). Because the hypothesis that T.L.O. was carrying cigarettes in her purse was itself not unreasonable, it is irrelevant that other hypotheses were also consistent with the teacher's accusation. Accordingly, it cannot be said that Mr. Choplick acted unreasonably when he examined T.L.O.'s purse to see if it contained cigarettes. [ Footnote 12 ]\nOur conclusion that Mr. Choplick's decision to open T.L.O.'s purse was reasonable brings us to the question of the further search for marihuana once the pack of cigarettes was located. The suspicion upon which the search for marihuana was founded was provided when Mr. Choplick observed a package of rolling papers in the purse as he removed the pack of cigarettes. Although T.L.O. does not dispute the reasonableness of Mr. Choplick's belief that the rolling papers indicated the presence of marihuana, she does contend that the scope of the search Mr. Choplick conducted exceeded permissible bounds when he seized and read certain letters that implicated T.L.O. in drug dealing. This argument, too, is unpersuasive. The discovery of the rolling papers concededly gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that T.L.O. was carrying marihuana as well as cigarettes in her purse. This suspicion justified further exploration of T.L.O.'s purse, which turned up more evidence of drug-related activities: a pipe, a number of plastic bags of the type commonly used to store marihuana, a small quantity of marihuana, and a fairly substantial amount of money. Under these circumstances, it was not unreasonable to extend the search to a separate zippered compartment of the purse; and when a search of that compartment revealed an index card containing a list of \"people who owe me money\" as well as two letters, the inference that T.L.O. was involved in marihuana trafficking was substantial enough to justify Mr. Choplick in examining the letters to determine whether they contained any further evidence. In short, we cannot conclude that the search for marihuana was unreasonable in any respect.\nBecause the search resulting in the discovery of the evidence of marihuana dealing by T.L.O. was reasonable, the New Jersey Supreme Court's decision to exclude that evidence\nfrom T.L.O.'s juvenile delinquency proceedings on Fourth Amendment grounds was erroneous. Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Jersey is\nReversed.\nT.L.O. also received a 3-day suspension from school for smoking cigarettes in a nonsmoking area and a 7-day suspension for possession of marihuana. On T.L.O.'s motion, the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, set aside the 7-day suspension on the ground that it was based on evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment. (T.L.O.) v. Piscataway Bd. of Ed., No. C.2865-79 (Super.Ct. N.J. Ch.Div., Mar. 31, 1980). The Board of Education apparently did not appeal the decision of the Chancery Division.\nState and federal courts considering these questions have struggled to accommodate the interests protected by the Fourth Amendment and the interest of the States in providing a safe environment conducive to education in the public schools. Some courts have resolved the tension between these interests by giving full force to one or the other side of the balance. Thus, in a number of cases courts have held that school officials conducting in-school searches of students are private parties acting in loco parentis and are therefore not subject to the constraints of the Fourth Amendment. See, e.g., D. R. C. v. State, 646 P.2d 252 (Alaska App.1982); In re G., 11 Cal. App. 3d 1193 , 90 Cal. Rptr. 361 (1970); In re Donaldson, 269 Cal. App. 2d 509 , 75 Cal. Rptr. 220 (1969); R.C.M. v. State, 660 S.W.2d 552 (Tex.App.1983); Mercer v. State, 450 S.W.2d 715 (Tex.Civ.App.1970). At least one court has held, on the other hand, that the Fourth Amendment applies in full to in-school searches by school officials and that a search conducted without probable cause is unreasonable, see State v. Mora, 307 So. 2d 317 (La.), vacated, 423 U.S. 809 (1975), on remand, 330 So. 2d 900 (La.1976); others have held or suggested that the probable cause standard is applicable at least where the police are involved in a search, see M. v. Board of Ed. Ball-Chatham Community Unit School Dist. No. 5, 429 F. Supp. 288 , 292 (SD Ill.1977); Picha v. Wielgos, 410 F. Supp. 1214 , 1219-1221 (ND Ill.1976); State v. Young, 234 Ga. 488, 498, 216 S.E.2d 586 , 594 (1975); or where the search is highly intrusive, See M.M. v. Anker, 607 F.2d 588, 589 (CA2 1979).\nThe majority of courts that have addressed the issue of the Fourth Amendment in the schools have, like the Supreme Court of New Jersey in this case, reached a middle position: the Fourth Amendment applies to searches conducted by school authorities, but the special needs of the school environment require assessment of the legality of such searches against a standard less exacting than that of probable cause. These courts have, by and large, upheld warrantless searches by school authorities provided that they are supported by a reasonable suspicion that the search will uncover evidence of an infraction of school disciplinary rules or a violation of the law. See, e.g., Tarter v. Raybuck, No. 83-3174 (CA6, Aug. 31, 1984); Bilorey v. Brown, 738 F.2d 1462 (CA9 1984); Hortol v. Goose Creek Independent School Dist., 690 F.2d 470 (CA5 1982); Bellnier v. Lund, 438 F. Supp. 47 (NDNY 1977); M. v. Board of Ed. Ball-Chatham Community Unit School Dist. No. 5, supra; In re W., 29 Cal. App. 3d 777 , 105 Cal. Rptr. 775 (1973); State v. Baccino, 282 A.2d 869 (Del. Super.1971); State v. D.T.W., 425 So. 2d 1383 (Fla.App.1983); State v. Young, supra; In re J.A. 85 Ill.App.3d 567, 406 N.E.2d 958 (1980); People v. Ward, 62 Mich.App. 46, 233 N.W.2d 180 (1975); Doe v. State, 88 N.M. 347, 540 P.2d 827 (App.1975); People v. D., 34 N.Y.2d 483, 315 N.E.2d 466 (1974); State v. McKinnon, 88 Wash. 2d 75 , 558 P.2d 781 (1977); In re L.L., 90 Wis.2d 585, 280 N.W.2d 343 (App.1979).\nAlthough few have considered the matter, courts have also split over whether the exclusionary rule is an appropriate remedy for Fourth Amendment violations committed by school authorities. The Georgia courts have held that although the Fourth Amendment applies to the schools, the exclusionary rule does not. See, e.g., State v. Young, supra; State v. Lamb, 137 Ga.App. 437, 224 S.E.2d 51 (1976). Other jurisdictions have applied the rule to exclude the fruits of unlawful school searches from criminal trials and delinquency proceedings. See State v. Mora, supra; People v. D., supra.\nIn holding that the search of T.L.O.'s purse did not violate the Fourth Amendment, we do not implicitly determine that the exclusionary rule applies to the fruits of unlawful searches conducted by school authorities. The question whether evidence should be excluded from a criminal proceeding involves two discrete inquiries: whether the evidence was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and whether the exclusionary rule is the appropriate remedy for the violation. Neither question is logically antecedent to the other, for a negative answer to either question is sufficient to dispose of the case. Thus, our determination that the search at issue in this case did not violate the Fourth Amendment implies no particular resolution of the question of the applicability of the exclusionary rule.\nCf. Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651 (1977) (holding that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment applies only to punishments imposed after criminal convictions and hence does not apply to the punishment of schoolchildren by public school officials).\nWe do not address the question, not presented by this case, whether a schoolchild has a legitimate expectation of privacy in lockers, desks, or other school property provided for the storage of school supplies. Nor do we express any opinion on the standards of any governing searches of such areas by school officials or by other public authorities acting at the request of school officials. Compare Zamora v. Pomeroy, 639 F.2d 662, 670 (CA10 1981) (\"Inasmuch as the school had assumed joint control of the locker it cannot be successfully maintained that the school did not have a right to inspect it\"), and People v. Overton, 24 N.Y.2d 522, 249 N.E.2d 366 (1969) (school administrators have power to consent to search of a student's locker), with State v. Engerud, 94 N.J. 331, 348, 463 A.2d 934 , 943 (1983) (\"We are satisfied that in the context of this case the student had an expectation of privacy in the contents of his locker. . . . For the four years of high school, the school locker is a home away from home. In it the student stores the kind of personal effects' protected by the Fourth Amendment\").\nSee cases cited in n. 2 supra.\nWe here consider only searches carried out by school authorities acting alone and on their own authority. This case does not present the question of the appropriate standard for assessing the legality of searches conducted by school officials in conjunction with or at the behest of law enforcement agencies, and we express no opinion on that question. Cf. Picha v. Wielgos, 410 F. Supp. 1214 , 1219-1221 (ND.Ill. 1976) (holding probable cause standard applicable to searches involving the police).\nWe do not decide whether individualized suspicion is an essential element of the reasonableness standard we adopt for searches by school authorities. In other contexts, however, we have held that although\n\"some quantum of individualized suspicion is usually a prerequisite to a constitutional search or seizure[,] . . . the Fourth Amendment imposes no irreducible requirement of such suspicion.\"\nUnited States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543 , 428 U. S. 560 -561 (1976). See also Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U. S. 523 (1967). Exceptions to the requirement of individualized suspicion are generally appropriate only where the privacy interests implicated by a search are minimal and where \"other safeguards\" are available \"to assure that the individual's reasonable expectation of privacy is not subject to the discretion of the official in the field.'\" Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S. 648 , 440 U. S. 654 -655 (1979) (citation omitted). Because the search of T.L.O.'s purse was based upon an individualized suspicion that she had violated school rules, see infra, at 469 U. S. 343 -347, we need not consider the circumstances that might justify school authorities in conducting searches unsupported by individualized suspicion.\nOur reference to the nature of the infraction is not intended as an endorsement of JUSTICE STEVENS' suggestion that some rules regarding student conduct are by nature too \"trivial\" to justify a search based upon reasonable suspicion. See post at 469 U. S. 377 -382. We are unwilling to adopt a standard under which the legality of a search is dependent upon a judge's evaluation of the relative importance of various school rules. The maintenance of discipline in the schools requires not only that students be restrained from assaulting one another, abusing drugs and alcohol, and committing other crimes, but also that students conform themselves to the standards of conduct prescribed by school authorities. We have\n\"repeatedly emphasized the need for affirming the comprehensive authority of the States and of school officials, consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards, to prescribe and control conduct in the schools.\"\nTinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U. S. 503 , 393 U. S. 507 (1969). The promulgation of a rule forbidding specified conduct presumably reflects a judgment on the part of school officials that such conduct is destructive of school order or of a proper educational environment. Absent any suggestion that the rule violates some substantive constitutional guarantee, the courts should, as a general matter, defer to that judgment and refrain from attempting to distinguish between rules that are important to the preservation of order in the schools and rules that are not.\nOf course, New Jersey may insist on a more demanding standard under its own Constitution or statutes. In that case, its courts would not purport to be applying the Fourth Amendment when they invalidate a search.\nJUSTICE STEVENS interprets these statements as a holding that enforcement of the school's smoking regulations was not sufficiently related to the goal of maintaining discipline or order in the school to justify a search under the standard adopted by the New Jersey court. See post at 469 U. S. 382 -384. We do not agree that this is an accurate characterization of the New Jersey Supreme Court's opinion. The New Jersey court did not hold that the school's smoking rules were unrelated to the goal of maintaining discipline or order, nor did it suggest that a search that would produce evidence bearing directly on an accusation that a student had violated the smoking rules would be impermissible under the court's reasonable-suspicion standard; rather, the court concluded that any evidence a search of T.L.O.'s purse was likely to produce would not have a sufficiently direct bearing on the infraction to justify a search -- a conclusion with which we cannot agree for the reasons set forth infra, at 469 U. S. 345 . JUSTICE STEVENS' suggestion that the New Jersey Supreme Court's decision rested on the perceived triviality of the smoking infraction appears to be a reflection of his own views rather than those of the New Jersey court.\nT.L.O. contends that even if it was reasonable for Mr. Choplick to open her purse to look for cigarettes, it was not reasonable for him to reach in and take the cigarettes out of her purse once he found them. Had he not removed the cigarettes from the purse, she asserts, he would not have observed the rolling papers that suggested the presence of marihuana, and the search for marihuana could not have taken place. T.L.O.'s argument is based on the fact that the cigarettes were not \"contraband,\" as no school rule forbade her to have them. Thus, according to T.L.O., the cigarettes were not subject to seizure or confiscation by school authorities, and Mr. Choplick was not entitled to take them out of T.L.O.'s purse regardless of whether he was entitled to peer into the purse to see if they were there. Such hairsplitting argumentation has no place in an inquiry addressed to the issue of reasonableness. If Mr. Choplick could permissibly search T.L.O.'s purse for cigarettes, it hardly seems reasonable to suggest that his natural reaction to finding them -- picking them up -- could be a constitutional violation. We find that neither in opening the purse nor in reaching into it to remove the cigarettes did Mr. Choplick violate the Fourth Amendment.\nJUSTICE POWELL, with whom JUSTICE O'CONNOR joins, concurring.\nI agree with the Court's decision, and generally with its opinion. I would place greater emphasis, however, on the special characteristics of elementary and secondary schools that make it unnecessary to afford students the same constitutional protections granted adults and juveniles in a nonschool setting.\nIn any realistic sense, students within the school environment have a lesser expectation of privacy than members of the population generally. They spend the school hours in close association with each other, both in the classroom and during recreation periods. The students in a particular class often know each other and their teachers quite well. Of necessity, teachers have a degree of familiarity with, and authority over, their students that is unparalleled except perhaps in the relationship between parent and child. It is simply unrealistic to think that students have the same subjective expectation of privacy as the population generally. But for purposes of deciding this case, I can assume that children in school -- no less than adults -- have privacy interests that society is prepared to recognize as legitimate.\nHowever one may characterize their privacy expectations, students properly are afforded some constitutional protections. In an often quoted statement, the Court said that students do not \"shed their constitutional rights . . . at the schoolhouse gate.\" Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U. S. 503 , 393 U. S. 506 (1969). The Court also has \"emphasized the need for affirming the comprehensive authority of the states and of school officials . . .\nto prescribe and control conduct in the schools.\" Id. at 393 U. S. 507 . See also Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U. S. 97 , 393 U. S. 104 (1968). The Court has balanced the interests of the student against the school officials' need to maintain discipline by recognizing qualitative differences between the constitutional remedies to which students and adults are entitled.\nIn Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565 (1975), the Court recognized a constitutional right to due process, and yet was careful to limit the exercise of this right by a student who challenged a disciplinary suspension. The only process found to be \"due\" was notice and a hearing described as \"rudimentary\"; it amounted to no more than \"the disciplinarian . . . informally discuss[ing] the alleged misconduct with the student minutes after it has occurred.\" Id. at 419 U. S. 581 -582. In Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651 (1977), we declined to extend the Eighth Amendment to prohibit the use of corporal punishment of schoolchildren as authorized by Florida law. We emphasized in that opinion that familiar constraints in the school, and also in the community, provide substantial protection against the violation of constitutional rights by school authorities.\n\"[A]t the end of the school day, the child is invariably free to return home. Even while at school, the child brings with him the support of family and friends and is rarely apart from teachers and other pupils who may witness and protest any instances of mistreatment.\"\nId. at 430 U. S. 670 . The Ingraham Court further pointed out that the \"openness of the public school and its supervision by the community afford significant safeguards\" against the violation of constitutional rights. Ibid.\nThe special relationship between teacher and student also distinguishes the setting within which schoolchildren operate. Law enforcement officers function as adversaries of criminal suspects. These officers have the responsibility to investigate criminal activity, to locate and arrest those who violate our laws, and to facilitate the charging and bringing of such persons to trial. Rarely does this type of adversarial\nrelationship exist between school authorities and pupils. [ Footnote 2/1 ] Instead, there is a commonality of interests between teachers and their pupils. The attitude of the typical teacher is one of personal responsibility for the student's welfare as well as for his education.\nThe primary duty of school officials and teachers, as the Court states, is the education and training of young people. A State has a compelling interest in assuring that the schools meet this responsibility. Without first establishing discipline and maintaining order, teachers cannot begin to educate their students. And apart from education, the school has the obligation to protect pupils from mistreatment by other children, and also to protect teachers themselves from violence by the few students whose conduct in recent years has prompted national concern. For me, it would be unreasonable and at odds with history to argue that the full panoply of constitutional rules applies with the same force and effect in the schoolhouse as it does in the enforcement of criminal laws. [ Footnote 2/2 ]\nIn sum, although I join the Court's opinion and its holding, [ Footnote 2/3 ] my emphasis is somewhat different.\nUnlike police officers, school authorities have no law enforcement responsibility or indeed any obligation to be familiar with the criminal laws. Of course, as illustrated by this case, school authorities have a layman's familiarity with the types of crimes that occur frequently in our schools: the distribution and use of drugs, theft, and even violence against teachers as well as fellow students.\nAs noted above, decisions of this Court have never held to the contrary. The law recognizes a host of distinctions between the rights and duties of children and those of adults. See Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565 , 419 U. S. 591 (1975) (POWELL, J., dissenting.)\nThe Court's holding is that \"when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that [a] search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school,\" a search of the student's person or belongings is justified. Ante at 469 U. S. 342 . This is in accord with the Court's summary of the views of a majority of the state and federal courts that have addressed this issue. See ante at 469 U. S. 332 -333, n. 2.\nJUSTICE BLACKMUN, concurring in the judgment.\nI join the judgment of the Court and agree with much that is said in its opinion. I write separately, however, because I believe the Court omits a crucial step in its analysis of whether a school search must be based upon probable cause. The Court correctly states that we have recognized limited exceptions to the probable cause requirement \"[w]here a careful balancing of governmental and private interests suggests that the public interest is best served\" by a lesser standard. Ante at 469 U. S. 341 . I believe that we have used such a balancing test, rather than strictly applying the Fourth Amendment's Warrant and Probable-Cause Clause, only when we were confronted with \"a special law enforcement need for greater flexibility.\" Florida v. Royer, 460 U. S. 491 , 460 U. S. 514 (1983) (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting). I pointed out in United States v. Place, 462 U. S. 696 (1983):\n\"While the Fourth Amendment speaks in terms of freedom from unreasonable [searches], the Amendment does not leave the reasonableness of most [searches] to the judgment of courts or government officers; the Framers of the Amendment balanced the interests involved and decided that a [search] is reasonable only if supported by a judicial warrant based on probable cause. See Texas v. Brown, 460 U. S. 730 , 460 U. S. 744 -745 (1983) (POWELL, J., concurring); United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56 , 339 U. S. 70 (1950) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).\"\nId. at 462 U. S. 722 (opinion concurring in judgment). See also Dunaway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200 , 442 U. S. 213 -214 (1979); United States v. United States District Court, 407 U. S. 297 , 407 U. S. 315 -316 (1972). Only in those exceptional circumstances in which special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement, make the warrant and probable cause requirement impracticable, is a court entitled to substitute its balancing of interests for that of the Framers.\nThus, for example, in determining that police can conduct a limited \"stop and frisk\" upon less than probable cause, this Court relied upon the fact that \"as a practical matter\" the stop and frisk could not be subjected to a warrant and probable cause requirement, because a law enforcement officer must be able to take immediate steps to assure himself that the person he has stopped to question is not armed with a weapon that could be used against him. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 , 392 U. S. 20 -21, 392 U. S. 23 -24 (1968). Similarly, this Court's holding that a roving Border Patrol may stop a car and briefly question its occupants upon less than probable cause was based in part upon \"the absence of practical alternatives for policing the border.\" United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U. S. 873 , 422 U. S. 881 (1975). See also Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032 , 463 U. S. 1049 , n. 14 (1983); United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543 , 428 U. S. 557 (1976); Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U. S. 523 , 387 U. S. 537 (1967).\nThe Court's implication that the balancing test is the rule rather than the exception is troubling for me because it is unnecessary in this case. The elementary and secondary school setting presents a special need for flexibility justifying a departure from the balance struck by the Framers. As JUSTICE POWELL notes, \"[w]ithout first establishing discipline and maintaining order, teachers cannot begin to educate their students.\" Ante at 469 U. S. 350 . Maintaining order in the classroom can be a difficult task. A single teacher often must watch over a large number of students, and, as any parent knows, children at certain ages are inclined to test the outer boundaries of acceptable conduct and to imitate the misbehavior of a peer if that misbehavior is not dealt with quickly. Every adult remembers from his own schooldays the havoc a water pistol or peashooter can wreak until it is taken away. Thus, the Court has recognized that \"[e]vents calling for discipline are frequent occurrences and sometimes require immediate, effective action.\" Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565 , 419 U. S. 580 (1975). Indeed, because drug use and possession of weapons have become increasingly common\namong young people, an immediate response frequently is required not just to maintain an environment conducive to learning, but to protect the very safety of students and school personnel.\nSuch immediate action obviously would not be possible if a teacher were required to secure a warrant before searching a student. Nor would it be possible if a teacher could not conduct a necessary search until the teacher thought there was probable cause for the search. A teacher has neither the training nor the day-to-day experience in the complexities of probable cause that a law enforcement officer possesses, and is ill-equipped to make a quick judgment about the existence of probable cause. The time required for a teacher to ask the questions or make the observations that are necessary to turn reasonable grounds into probable cause is time during which the teacher, and other students, are diverted from the essential task of education. A teacher's focus is, and should be, on teaching and helping students, rather than on developing evidence against a particular troublemaker.\nEducation \"is perhaps the most important function\" of government, Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 , 347 U. S. 493 (1954), and government has a heightened obligation to safeguard students whom it compels to attend school. The special need for an immediate response to behavior that threatens either the safety of schoolchildren and teachers or the educational process itself justifies the Court in excepting school searches from the warrant and probable cause requirement, and in applying a standard determined by balancing the relevant interests. I agree with the standard the Court has announced, and with its application of the standard to the facts of this case. I therefore concur in its judgment.\nJUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\nI fully agree with Part 469 U. S. Teachers, like all other government officials, must conform their\nconduct to the Fourth Amendment's protections of personal privacy and personal security. As JUSTICE STEVENS points out, post at 469 U. S. 373 -374, 469 U. S. 385 -386, this principle is of particular importance when applied to schoolteachers, for children learn as much by example as by exposition. It would be incongruous and futile to charge teachers with the task of embuing their students with an understanding of our system of constitutional democracy, while at the same time immunizing those same teachers from the need to respect constitutional protections. See Board of Education v. Pico, 457 U. S. 853 , 457 U. S. 864 -865 (1982) (plurality opinion); West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624 , 319 U. S. 637 (1943).\nI do not, however, otherwise join the Court's opinion. Today's decision sanctions school officials to conduct fullscale searches on a \"reasonableness\" standard whose only definite content is that it is not the same test as the \"probable cause\" standard found in the text of the Fourth Amendment. In adopting this unclear, unprecedented, and unnecessary departure from generally applicable Fourth Amendment standards, the Court carves out a broad exception to standards that this Court has developed over years of considering Fourth Amendment problems. Its decision is supported neither by precedent nor even by a fair application of the \"balancing test\" it proclaims in this very opinion.\nI\nThree basic principles underly this Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. First, warrantless searches are per se unreasonable, subject only to a few specifically delineated and well-recognized exceptions. See, e.g., Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 , 389 U. S. 357 (1967); accord, Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740 , 466 U. S. 748 -749 (1984); United States v. Place, 462 U. S. 696 , 462 U. S. 701 (1983); Steagald v. United States, 451 U. S. 204 , 451 U. S. 211 -212 (1981); Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385 (1978); Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 , 392 U. S. 20 (1968); Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10 , 333 U. S. 13 -14 (1948). Second, full-scale searches -- whether conducted in accordance with the warrant\nrequirement or pursuant to one of its exceptions -- are \"reasonable\" in Fourth Amendment terms only on a showing of probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that evidence of the crime will be found in the place to be searched. Beck v. Ohio, 379 U. S. 89 , 379 U. S. 91 (1964); Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U. S. 471 , 371 U. S. 479 (1963); Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160 , 338 U. S. 175 -176 (1949). Third, categories of intrusions that are substantially less intrusive than full-scale searches or seizures may be justifiable in accordance with a balancing test even absent a warrant or probable cause, provided that the balancing test used gives sufficient weight to the privacy interests that will be infringed. Dunaway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200 , 442 U. S. 210 (1979); Terry v. Ohio, supra.\nAssistant Vice Principal Choplick's thorough excavation of T.L.O.'s purse was undoubtedly a serious intrusion on her privacy. Unlike the searches in Terry v. Ohio, supra, or Adams v. Williams, 407 U. S. 143 (1972), the search at issue here encompassed a detailed and minute examination of respondent's pocketbook, in which the contents of private papers and letters were thoroughly scrutinized. [ Footnote 3/1 ] Wisely, neither petitioner nor the Court today attempts to justify the search of T.L.O.'s pocketbook as a minimally intrusive search in the Terry line. To be faithful to the Court's settled doctrine, the inquiry therefore must focus on the warrant and probable cause requirements.\nA\nI agree that schoolteachers or principals, when not acting as agents of law enforcement authorities, generally may conduct a search of their students' belongings without first\nobtaining a warrant. To agree with the Court on this point is to say that school searches may justifiably be held to that extent to constitute an exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement. Such an exception, however, is not to be justified, as the Court apparently holds, by assessing net social value through application of an unguided \"balancing test\" in which \"the individual's legitimate expectations of privacy and personal security\" are weighed against \"the government's need for effective methods to deal with breaches of public order.\" Ante at 469 U. S. 337 . The Warrant Clause is something more than an exhortation to this Court to maximize social welfare as we see fit. It requires that the authorities must obtain a warrant before conducting a full-scale search. The undifferentiated governmental interest in law enforcement is insufficient to justify an exception to the warrant requirement. Rather, some special governmental interest beyond the need merely to apprehend lawbreakers is necessary to justify a categorical exception to the warrant requirement. For the most part, special governmental needs sufficient to override the warrant requirement flow from \"exigency\" -- that is, from the press of time that makes obtaining a warrant either impossible or hopelessly infeasible. See United States v. Place, supra, at 462 U. S. 701 -702; Mincey v. Arizona, supra, at 437 U. S. 393 -394; Johnson v. United States, supra, at 333 U. S. 15 . Only after finding an extraordinary governmental interest of this kind do we -- or ought we -- engage in a balancing test to determine if a warrant should nonetheless be required. [ Footnote 3/2 ]\nTo require a showing of some extraordinary governmental interest before dispensing with the warrant requirement is not to undervalue society's need to apprehend violators of the criminal law. To be sure, forcing law enforcement personnel to obtain a warrant before engaging in a search will predictably deter the police from conducting some searches that they would otherwise like to conduct. But this is not an unintended result of the Fourth Amendment's protection of privacy; rather, it is the very purpose for which the Amendment was thought necessary. Only where the governmental interests at stake exceed those implicated in any ordinary law enforcement context -- that is, only where there is some extraordinary governmental interest involved -- is it legitimate to engage in a balancing test to determine whether a warrant is indeed necessary.\nIn this case, such extraordinary governmental interests do exist and are sufficient to justify an exception to the warrant requirement. Students are necessarily confined for most of the schoolday in close proximity to each other and to the school staff. I agree with the Court that we can take judicial notice of the serious problems of drugs and violence that plague our schools. As JUSTICE BLACKMUN notes, teachers must not merely \"maintain an environment conducive to learning\" among children who \"are inclined to test the outer boundaries of acceptable conduct,\" but must also \"protect the very safety of students and school personnel.\" Ante at 469 U. S. 352 -353. A teacher or principal could neither carry out essential teaching functions nor adequately protect students' safety if required to wait for a warrant before conducting a necessary search.\nB\nI emphatically disagree with the Court's decision to cast aside the constitutional probable cause standard when assessing the constitutional validity of a schoolhouse search. The Court's decision jettisons the probable cause standard -- the only standard that finds support in the text of the Fourth\nAmendment -- on the basis of its Rohrschach-1ike \"balancing test.\" Use of such a \"balancing test\" to determine the standard for evaluating the validity of a full-scale search represents a sizable innovation in Fourth Amendment analysis. This innovation finds support neither in precedent nor policy and portends a dangerous weakening of the purpose of the Fourth Amendment to protect the privacy and security of our citizens. Moreover, even if this Court's historic understanding of the Fourth Amendment were mistaken and a balancing test of some kind were appropriate, any such test that gave adequate weight to the privacy and security interests protected by the Fourth Amendment would not reach the preordained result the Court's conclusory analysis reaches today. Therefore, because I believe that the balancing test used by the Court today is flawed both in its inception and in its execution, I respectfully dissent.\n1\nAn unbroken line of cases in this Court have held that probable cause is a prerequisite for a full-scale search. In Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132 , 267 U. S. 149 (1925), the Court held that \"[o]n reason and authority the true rule is that, if the search and seizure . . . are made upon probable cause . . . the search and seizure are valid.\" Under our past decisions probable cause -- which exists where\n\"the facts and circumstances within [the officials'] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief\"\nthat a criminal offense had occurred and the evidence would be found in the suspected place, id. at 267 U. S. 162 -- is the constitutional minimum for justifying a full-scale search, regardless of whether it is conducted pursuant to a warrant or, as in Carroll, within one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement. Henry v. United States, 361 U. S. 98 , 361 U. S. 104 (1959) ( Caroll \"merely relaxed the requirements for a warrant on grounds of practicality,\" but \"did not dispense\nwith the need for probable cause\"); accord, Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42 , 399 U. S. 51 (1970) (\"In enforcing the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures, the Court has insisted upon probable cause as a minimum requirement for a reasonable search permitted by the Constitution\"). [ Footnote 3/3 ]\nOur holdings that probable cause is a prerequisite to a fullscale search are based on the relationship between the two Clauses of the Fourth Amendment. The first Clause (\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated . . .\") states the purpose of the Amendment and its coverage. The second Clause (\". . . and no Warrants shall issue but upon probable cause . . .\") gives content to the word \"unreasonable\" in the first Clause.\n\"For all but . . . narrowly defined intrusions, the requisite 'balancing' has been performed in centuries of precedent and is embodied in the principle that seizures are 'reasonable' only if supported by probable cause.\"\nDunaway v. New York, 442 U.S. at 442 U. S. 214 .\nI therefore fully agree with the Court that \"the underlying command of the Fourth Amendment is always that searches and seizures be reasonable.\" Ante at 469 U. S. 337 . But this \"underlying command\" is not directly interpreted in each category of cases by some amorphous \"balancing test.\" Rather, the provisions of the Warrant Clause -- a warrant and probable cause -- provide the yardstick against which official searches\nand seizures are to be measured. The Fourth Amendment neither requires nor authorizes the conceptual free-for-all that ensues when an unguided balancing test is used to assess specific categories of searches. If the search in question is more than a minimally intrusive Terry stop, the constitutional probable cause standard determines its validity.\nTo be sure, the Court recognizes that probable cause \"ordinarily\" is required to justify a full-scale search and that the existence of probable cause \"bears on\" the validity of the search. Ante at 469 U. S. 340 -341. Yet the Court fails to cite any case in which a full-scale intrusion upon privacy interests has been justified on less than probable cause. The line of cases begun by Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968), provides no support, for they applied a balancing test only in the context of minimally intrusive searches that served crucial law enforcement interests. The search in Terry itself, for instance, was a \"limited search of the outer clothing.\" Id. at 392 U. S. 30 . The type of border stop at issue in United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U. S. 873 , 422 U. S. 880 (1975), usually \"consume[d] no more than a minute\"; the Court explicitly noted that \"any further detention . . . must be based on consent or probable cause.\" Id. at 422 U. S. 882 . See also United States v. Hensley, ante at 469 U. S. 224 (momentary stop); United States v. Place, 462 U.S. at 462 U. S. 706 -707 (brief detention of luggage for canine \"sniff\"); Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U. S. 106 (1977) (per curiam) (brief frisk after stop for traffic violation); United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543 , 428 U. S. 560 (1976) (characterizing intrusion as \"minimal\"); Adams v. Williams, 407 U. S. 143 (1972) (stop and frisk). In short, all of these cases involved\n\"'seizures' so substantially less intrusive than arrests that the general rule requiring probable cause to make Fourth Amendment 'seizures' reasonable could be replaced by a balancing test.\"\nNor do the \"administrative search\" cases provide any comfort for the Court. In Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U. S. 523 (1967), the Court held that the probable cause standard governed even administrative searches. Although\nthe Camara Court recognized that probable cause standards themselves may have to be somewhat modified to take into account the special nature of administrative searches, the Court did so only after noting that \"because [housing code] inspections are neither personal in nature nor aimed at the discovery of evidence of crime, they involve a relatively limited invasion of the urban citizen's privacy.\" Id. at 387 U. S. 537 . Subsequent administrative search cases have similarly recognized that such searches intrude upon areas whose owners harbor a significantly decreased expectation of privacy, see, e.g., Donovan v. Dewey, 452 U. S. 594 , 452 U. S. 598 -599 (1981), thus circumscribing the injury to Fourth Amendment interests caused by the search.\nConsiderations of the deepest significance for the freedom of our citizens counsel strict adherence to the principle that no search may be conducted where the official is not in possession of probable cause that is, where the official does not know of \"facts and circumstances [that] warrant a prudent man in believing that the offense has been committed.\" Henry v. United States, 361 U.S. at 361 U. S. 102 ; see also id. at 361 U. S. 100 -101 (discussing history of probable cause standard). The Fourth Amendment was designed not merely to protect against official intrusions whose social utility was less as measured by some \"balancing test\" than its intrusion on individual privacy; it was designed in addition to grant the individual a zone of privacy whose protections could be breached only where the \"reasonable\" requirements of the probable cause standard were met. Moved by whatever momentary evil has aroused their fears, officials -- perhaps even supported by a majority of citizens -- may be tempted to conduct searches that sacrifice the liberty of each citizen to assuage the perceived evil. [ Footnote 3/4 ] But the Fourth Amendment\nrests on the principle that a true balance between the individual and society depends on the recognition of \"the right to be let alone the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men.\" Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 , 277 U. S. 478 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). That right protects the privacy and security of the individual unless the authorities can cross a specific threshold of need, designated by the term \"probable cause.\" I cannot agree with the Court's assertions today that a \"balancing test\" can replace the constitutional threshold with one that is more convenient for those enforcing the laws but less protective of the citizens' liberty; the Fourth Amendment's protections should not be defaced by\n\"a balancing process that overwhelms the individual's protection against unwarranted official intrusion by a governmental interest said to justify the search and seizure.\"\nUnited States v. Martinez-Fuerte, supra, at 428 U. S. 570 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).\n2\nI thus do not accept the majority's premise that\n\"[t]o hold that the Fourth Amendment applies to searches conducted by school authorities is only to begin the inquiry into the standards governing such searches.\"\nAnte at 469 U. S. 337 . For me, the finding that the Fourth Amendment applies, coupled with the observation that what is at issue is a full-scale search, is the end of the inquiry. But even if I believed that a \"balancing test\" appropriately replaces the judgment of the Framers of the Fourth Amendment, I would nonetheless object to the cursory and shortsighted \"test\" that the Court employs to justify its predictable weakening of Fourth Amendment protections. In particular, the test employed by the Court vastly overstates the social costs that a probable cause standard entails and, though it plausibly articulates the serious privacy interests at stake, inexplicably fails to accord them adequate weight in striking the balance.\nThe Court begins to articulate its \"balancing test\" by observing that \"the government's need for effective methods to deal with breaches of public order\" is to be weighed on one side of the balance. Ibid. Of course, this is not correct. It is not the government's need for effective enforcement methods that should weigh in the balance, for ordinary Fourth Amendment standards -- including probable cause.-- may well permit methods for maintaining the public order that are perfectly effective. If that were the case, the governmental interest in having effective standards would carry no weight at all as a justification for departing from the probable cause standard. Rather, it is the costs of applying probable cause as opposed to applying some lesser standard that should be weighed on the government's side. [ Footnote 3/5 ]\nIn order to tote up the costs of applying the probable-cause standard, it is thus necessary first to take into account the nature and content of that standard, and the likelihood that it would hamper achievement of the goal -- vital not just to \"teachers and administrators,\" see ante at 469 U. S. 339 -- of maintaining an effective educational setting in the public schools. The seminal statement concerning the nature of the probable cause standard is found in Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132 (1925). Carroll held that law enforcement authorities have probable cause to search where\n\"the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to\nwarrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief\"\nthat a criminal offense had occurred. Id. at 267 U. S. 162 . In Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160 (1949), the Court amplified this requirement, holding that probable cause depends upon \"the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\" Id. at 338 U. S. 175 .\nTwo Terms ago, in Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213 (1983), this Court expounded at some length its view of the probable cause standard. Among the adjectives used to describe the standard were \"practical,\" \"fluid,\" \"flexible,\" \"easily applied,\" and \"nontechnical.\" See id. at 462 U. S. 232 , 462 U. S. 236 , 462 U. S. 239 . The probable cause standard was to be seen as a \"common-sense\" test whose application depended on an evaluation of the \"totality of the circumstances.\" Id. at 462 U. S. 238 .\nIgnoring what Gates took such great pains to emphasize, the Court today holds that a new \"reasonableness\" standard is appropriate because it\n\"will spare teachers and school administrators the necessity of schooling themselves in the niceties of probable cause and permit them to regulate their conduct according to the dictates of reason and common sense.\"\nAnte at 469 U. S. 343 . I had never thought that our pre- Gates understanding of probable cause defied either reason or common sense. But after Gates, I would have thought that there could be no doubt that this \"nontechnical,\" \"practical,\" and \"easily applied\" concept was eminently serviceable in a context like a school, where teachers require the flexibility to respond quickly and decisively to emergencies.\nA consideration of the likely operation of the probable cause standard reinforces this conclusion. Discussing the issue of school searches, Professor LaFave has noted that the cases that have reached the appellate courts\n\"strongly suggest that in most instances the evidence of wrong-doing prompting teachers or principals to conduct searches is sufficiently detailed and specific to meet the traditional probable cause test.\"\n3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 10.11,\npp. 459-460 (1978). [ Footnote 3/6 ] The problems that have caused this Court difficulty in interpreting the probable cause standard have largely involved informants, see, e.g., Illinois v. Gates, supra; Spinelli v. United States, 393 U. S. 410 (1969); Agilar v. Texas, 378 U. S. 108 (1964); Draper v. United States, 358 U. S. 307 (1959). However, three factors make it likely that problems involving informants will not make it difficult for teachers and school administrators to make probable cause decisions. This Court's decision in Gates applying a \"totality of the circumstances\" test to determine whether an informant's tip can constitute probable cause renders the test easy for teachers to apply. The fact that students and teachers interact daily in the school building makes it more likely that teachers will get to know students who supply information; the problem of informants who remain anonymous even to the teachers -- and who are therefore unavailable for verification or further questioning -- is unlikely to arise. Finally, teachers can observe the behavior of students under suspicion to corroborate any doubtful tips they do receive.\nAs compared with the relative ease with which teachers can apply the probable cause standard, the amorphous \"reasonableness under all the circumstances\" standard freshly coined by the Court today will likely spawn increased litigation and greater uncertainty among teachers and administrators. Of course, as this Court should know, an essential purpose of developing and articulating legal norms is to enable individuals to conform their conduct to those norms. A school system conscientiously attempting to obey the Fourth Amendment's dictates under a probable cause standard could, for example, consult decisions and other legal materials and prepare a booklet expounding the rough outlines of the concept. Such a booklet could be distributed to\nteachers to provide them with guidance as to when a search may be lawfully conducted. I cannot but believe that the same school system faced with interpreting what is permitted under the Court's new \"reasonableness\" standard would be hopelessly adrift as to when a search may be permissible. The sad result of this uncertainty may well be that some teachers will be reluctant to conduct searches that are fully permissible and even necessary under the constitutional probable cause standard, while others may intrude arbitrarily and unjustifiably on the privacy of students. [ Footnote 3/7 ]\nOne further point should be taken into account when considering the desirability of replacing the constitutional probable cause standard. The question facing the Court is not whether the probable cause standard should be replaced by a test of \"reasonableness under all the circumstances.\" Rather, it is whether traditional Fourth Amendment standards should recede before the Court's new standard. Thus, although the Court today paints with a broad brush and holds its undefined \"reasonableness\" standard applicable to all school searches, I would approach the question with considerably more reserve. I would not think it necessary to develop a single standard to govern all school searches, any more\nthan traditional Fourth Amendment law applies even the probable cause standard to all searches and seizures. For instance, just as police officers may conduct a brief stop and frisk on something less than probable cause, so too should teachers be permitted the same flexibility. A teacher or administrator who had reasonable suspicion that a student was carrying a gun would no doubt have authority under ordinary Fourth Amendment doctrine to conduct a limited search of the student to determine whether the threat was genuine. The \"costs\" of applying the traditional probable cause standard must therefore be discounted by the fact that, where additional flexibility is necessary and where the intrusion is minor, traditional Fourth Amendment jurisprudence itself displaces probable cause when it determines the validity of a search.\nA legitimate balancing test whose function was something more substantial than reaching a predetermined conclusion acceptable to this Court's impressions of what authority teachers need would therefore reach rather a different result than that reached by the Court today. On one side of the balance would be the costs of applying traditional Fourth Amendment standards -- the \"practical\" and \"flexible\" probable cause standard where a full-scale intrusion is sought, a lesser standard in situations where the intrusion is much less severe and the need for greater authority compelling. Whatever costs were toted up on this side would have to be discounted by the costs of applying an unprecedented and ill-defined \"reasonableness under all the circumstances\" test that will leave teachers and administrators uncertain as to their authority and will encourage excessive fact-based litigation.\nOn the other side of the balance would be the serious privacy interests of the student, interests that the Court admirably articulates in its opinion, ante at 469 U. S. 337 -339, but which the Court's new ambiguous standard places in serious jeopardy. I have no doubt that a fair assessment of the two\nsides of the balance would necessarily reach the same conclusion that, as I have argued above, the Fourth Amendment's language compels -- that school searches like that conducted in this case are valid only if supported by probable cause.\nII\nApplying the constitutional probable cause standard to the facts of this case, I would find that Mr. Choplick's search violated T.L.O.'s Fourth Amendment rights. After escorting T.L.O. into his private office, Mr. Choplick demanded to see her purse. He then opened the purse to find evidence of whether she had been smoking in the bathroom. When he opened the purse, he discovered the pack of cigarettes. At this point, his search for evidence of the smoking violation was complete.\nMr. Choplick then noticed, below the cigarettes, a pack of cigarette rolling papers. Believing that such papers were \"associated,\" see ante at 469 U. S. 328 , with the use of marihuana, he proceeded to conduct a detailed examination of the contents of her purse, in which he found some marihuana, a pipe, some money, an index card, and some private letters indicating that T.L.O. had sold marihuana to other students. The State sought to introduce this latter material in evidence at a criminal proceeding, and the issue before the Court is whether it should have been suppressed.\nOn my view of the case, we need not decide whether the initial search conducted by Mr. Choplick -- the search for evidence of the smoking violation that was completed when Mr. Choplick found the pack of cigarettes -- was valid. For Mr. Choplick at that point did not have probable cause to continue to rummage through T.L.O.'s purse. Mr. Choplick's suspicion of marihuana possession at this time was based solely on the presence of the package of cigarette papers. The mere presence without more of such a staple item of commerce is insufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in inferring both that T.L.O. had violated the law\nby possessing marihuana and that evidence of that violation would be found in her purse. Just as a police officer could not obtain a warrant to search a home based solely on his claim that he had seen a package of cigarette papers in that home, Mr. Choplick was not entitled to search possibly the most private possessions of T.L.O. based on the mere presence of a package of cigarette papers. Therefore, the fruits of this illegal search must be excluded and the judgment of the New Jersey Supreme Court affirmed.\nIII\nIn the past several Terms, this Court has produced a succession of Fourth Amendment opinions in which \"balancing tests\" have been applied to resolve various questions concerning the proper scope of official searches. The Court has begun to apply a \"balancing test\" to determine whether a particular category of searches intrudes upon expectations of privacy that merit Fourth Amendment protection. See Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517 , 468 U. S. 527 (1984) (\"Determining whether an expectation of privacy is legitimate' or `reasonable' necessarily entails a balancing of interests\"). It applies a \"balancing test\" to determine whether a warrant is necessary to conduct a search. See ante at 469 U. S. 340 ; United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. at 428 U. S. 564 -566. In today's opinion, it employs a \"balancing test\" to determine what standard should govern the constitutionality of a given category of searches. See ante at 469 U. S. 340 -341. Should a search turn out to be unreasonable after application of all of these \"balancing tests,\" the Court then applies an additional \"balancing test\" to decide whether the evidence resulting from the search must be excluded. See United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897 (1984).\nAll of these \"balancing tests\" amount to brief nods by the Court in the direction of a neutral utilitarian calculus while the Court in fact engages in an unanalyzed exercise of judicial will. Perhaps this doctrinally destructive nihilism is merely\na convenient umbrella under which a majority that cannot agree on a genuine rationale can conceal its differences. Compare ante p. 469 U. S. 327 (WHITE, J., delivering the opinion of the Court), with ante p. 469 U. S. 348 (POWELL, J., joined by O'CONNOR, J., concurring), and ante p. 469 U. S. 351 (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in judgment). And it may be that the real force underlying today's decision is the belief that the Court purports to reject -- the belief that the unique role served by the schools justifies an exception to the Fourth Amendment on their behalf. If so, the methodology of today's decision may turn out to have as little influence in future cases as will its result, and the Court's departure from traditional Fourth Amendment doctrine will be confined to the schools.\nOn my view, the presence of the word \"unreasonable\" in the text of the Fourth Amendment does not grant a shifting majority of this Court the authority to answer all Fourth Amendment questions by consulting its momentary vision of the social good. Full-scale searches unaccompanied by probable cause violate the Fourth Amendment. I do not pretend that our traditional Fourth Amendment doctrine automatically answers all of the difficult legal questions that occasionally arise. I do contend, however, that this Court has an obligation to provide some coherent framework to resolve such questions on the basis of more than a conclusory recitation of the results of a \"balancing test.\" The Fourth Amendment itself supplies that framework and, because the Court today fails to heed its message, I must respectfully dissent.\nA purse typically contains items of highly personal nature. Especially for shy or sensitive adolescents, it could prove extremely embarrassing for a teacher or principal to rummage through its contents, which could include notes from friends, fragments of love poems, caricatures of school authorities, and items of personal hygiene.\nAdministrative search cases involving inspection schemes have recognized that\n\"if inspection is to be effective and serve as a credible deterrent, unannounced, even frequent, inspections are essential. In this context, the prerequisite of a warrant could easily frustrate inspection. . . .\"\nIn fact, despite the somewhat diminished expectation of privacy that this Court has recognized in the automobile context, see South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U. S. 364 , 428 U. S. 367 -368 (1976), we have required probable cause even to justify a warrantless automobile search, see United States v. Ortiz, 422 U. S. 891 , 422 U. S. 896 (1975) (\"A search, even of an automobile, is a substantial invasion of privacy. To protect that privacy from official arbitrariness, the Court always has regarded probable cause as the minimum requirement for a lawful search\") (footnote omitted); Chamers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. at 399 U. S. 51 .\nAs Justice Stewart said in Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443 , 403 U. S. 455 (1971):\n\"In times of unrest, whether caused by crime or racial conflict or fear of internal subversion this basic law and the values that it represents may appear unrealistic or 'extravagant' to some. But the values were those of the authors of our fundamental constitutional concepts.\"\nI speak of the \"government's side\" only because it is the terminology used by the Court. In my view, this terminology itself is seriously misleading. The government is charged with protecting the privacy and security of the citizen, just as it is charged with apprehending those who violate the criminal law. Consequently, the government has no legitimate interest in conducting a search that unduly intrudes on the privacy and security of the citizen. The balance is not between the rights of the government and the rights of the citizen, but between opposing conceptions of the constitutionally legitimate means of carrying out the government's varied responsibilities.\nIt should be noted that Professor LaFave reached this conclusion in 1978, before this Court's decision in Gates made clear the \"flexibility\" of the probable cause concept.\nA comparison of the language of the standard (\"reasonableness under all the circumstances\") with the traditional language of probable cause (\"facts sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in believing that a crime had been committed and the evidence would be found in the designated place\") suggests that the Court's new standard may turn out to be probable cause under a new guise. If so, the additional uncertainty caused by this Court's innovation is surely unjustifiable; it would be naive to expect that the addition of this extra dose of uncertainty would do anything other than \"burden the efforts of school authorities to maintain order in their schools,\" ante at 469 U. S. 342 . If, on the other hand, the new standard permits searches of students in instances when probable cause is absent -- instances, according to this Court's consistent formulations, when a person of reasonable caution would not think it likely that a violation existed or that evidence of that violation would be found -- the new standard is genuinely objectionable and impossible to square with the premise that our citizens have the right to be free from arbitrary intrusions on their privacy.\nJUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL joins, and with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN joins as to Part I, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\nAssistant Vice Principal Choplick searched T.L.O.'s purse for evidence that she was smoking in the girls' restroom. Because T.L.O.'s suspected misconduct was not illegal and did not pose a serious threat to school discipline, the New Jersey Supreme Court held that Choplick's search\nof her purse was an unreasonable invasion of her privacy and that the evidence which he seized could not be used against her in criminal proceedings. The New Jersey court's holding was a careful response to the case it was required to decide.\nThe State of New Jersey sought review in this Court, first arguing that the exclusionary rule is wholly inapplicable to searches conducted by school officials, and then contending that the Fourth Amendment itself provides no protection at all to the student's privacy. The Court has accepted neither of these frontal assaults on the Fourth Amendment. It has, however, seized upon this \"no smoking\" case to announce \"the proper standard\" that should govern searches by school officials who are confronted with disciplinary problems far more severe than smoking in the restroom. Although I join Part 469 U. S. I continue to believe that the Court has unnecessarily and inappropriately reached out to decide a constitutional question. See 468 U. S. 1214 (1984) (STEVENS, J., dissenting from reargument order). More importantly, I fear that the concerns that motivated the Court's activism have produced a holding that will permit school administrators to search students suspected of violating only the most trivial school regulations and guidelines for behavior.\nI\nThe question the Court decides today -- whether Mr. Choplick's search of T.L.O.'s purse violated the Fourth Amendment -- was not raised by the State's petition for writ of certiorari. That petition only raised one question: \"Whether the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary rule applies to searches made by public school officials and teachers in school.\" [ Footnote 4/1 ] The State quite properly declined to submit the former question because \"[it] did not wish to present what might appear to be solely a factual dispute to this Court.\" [ Footnote 4/2 ]\nSince this Court has twice had the threshold question argued, I believe that it should expressly consider the merits of the New Jersey Supreme Court's ruling that the exclusionary rule applies.\nThe New Jersey Supreme Court's holding on this question is plainly correct. As the state court noted, this case does not involve the use of evidence in a school disciplinary proceeding; the juvenile proceedings brought against T.L.O. involved a charge that would have been a criminal offense if committed by an adult. [ Footnote 4/3 ] Accordingly, the exclusionary rule issue decided by that court and later presented to this Court concerned only the use in a criminal proceeding of evidence obtained in a search conducted by a public school administrator.\nHaving confined the issue to the law enforcement context, the New Jersey court then reasoned that this Court's cases have made it quite clear that the exclusionary rule is equally applicable\n\"whether the public official who illegally obtained the evidence was a municipal inspector, See v. Seattle, 387 U. S. 541 [1967]; Camara [v. Municipal Court,] 387 U. S. 523 [1967]; a firefighter, Michigan v. Tyler, 436 U. S. 499 , 436 U. S. 506 [1978]; or a school administrator or law enforcement official. [ Footnote 4/4 ]\"\nIt correctly concluded \"that, if an official search violates constitutional rights, the evidence is not admissible in criminal proceedings.\" [ Footnote 4/5 ]\nWhen a defendant in a criminal proceeding alleges that she was the victim of an illegal search by a school administrator, the application of the exclusionary rule is a simple corollary of the principle that\n\"all evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is, by that same authority, inadmissible in a state court.\"\nMapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 , 367 U. S. 655 (1961). The practical basis for this principle is, in part, its deterrent effect, see id. at 367 U. S. 656 , and as a general\nmatter it is tolerably clear to me, as it has been to the Court, that the existence of an exclusionary remedy does deter the authorities from violating the Fourth Amendment by sharply reducing their incentive to do so. [ Footnote 4/6 ] In the case of evidence obtained in school searches, the \"overall educative effect\" [ Footnote 4/7 ] of the exclusionary rule adds important symbolic force to this utilitarian judgment.\nJustice Brandeis was both a great student and a great teacher. It was he who wrote:\n\"Our Government is the potent, the onmipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example. Crime is contagious. If the Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy.\"\nOlmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 , 277 U. S. 485 (1928) (dissenting opinion). Those of us who revere the flag and the ideals for which it stands believe in the power of symbols. We cannot ignore that rules of law also have a symbolic power that may vastly exceed their utility.\nSchools are places where we inculcate the values essential to the meaningful exercise of rights and responsibilities by a self-governing citizenry. [ Footnote 4/8 ] If the Nation's students can be convicted through the use of arbitrary methods destructive of personal liberty, they cannot help but feel that they have\nbeen dealt with unfairly. [ Footnote 4/9 ] The application of the exclusionary rule in criminal proceedings arising from illegal school searches makes an important statement to young people that \"our society attaches serious consequences to a violation of constitutional rights,\" [ Footnote 4/10 ] and that this is a principle of \"liberty and justice for all.\" [ Footnote 4/11 ]\nThus, the simple and correct answer to the question presented by the State's petition for certiorari would have required affirmance of a state court's judgment suppressing evidence. That result would have been dramatically out of character for a Court that not only grants prosecutors relief from suppression orders with distressing regularity, [ Footnote 4/12 ] but\nalso is prone to rely on grounds not advanced by the parties in order to protect evidence from exclusion. [ Footnote 4/13 ] In characteristic disregard of the doctrine of judicial restraint, the Court avoided that result in this case by ordering reargument and directing the parties to address a constitutional question that the parties, with good reason, had not asked the Court to decide. Because judicial activism undermines the Court's power to perform its central mission in a legitimate way, I dissented from the reargument order. See 468 U. S. 1214 (1984). I have not modified the views expressed in that dissent, but since the majority has brought the question before us, I shall explain why I believe the Court has misapplied the standard of reasonableness embodied in the Fourth Amendment.\nII\nThe search of a young woman's purse by a school administrator is a serious invasion of her legitimate expectations of privacy. A purse \"is a common repository for one's personal effects and therefore is inevitably associated with the expectation of privacy.\" Arkansas v. Sanders, 442 U. S. 753 , 442 U. S. 762 (1979). Although such expectations must sometimes yield to the legitimate requirements of government, in assessing the constitutionality of a warrantless search, our decision must be guided by the language of the Fourth Amendment: \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,\npapers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated. . . . \" In order to evaluate the reasonableness of such searches,\n\"it is necessary 'first to focus upon the governmental interest which allegedly justifies official intrusion upon the constitutionally protected interests of the private citizen,' for there is 'no ready test for determining reasonableness other than by balancing the need to search [or seize] against the invasion which the search [or seizure] entails.'\"\nThe \"limited search for weapons\" in Terry was justified by the \"immediate interest of the police officer in taking steps to assure himself that the person with whom he is dealing is not armed with a weapon that could unexpectedly and fatally be used against him.\" 392 U.S. at 392 U. S. 23 , 392 U. S. 25 . When viewed from the institutional perspective, \"the substantial need of teachers and administrators for freedom to maintain order in the schools,\" ante at 469 U. S. 341 (majority opinion), is no less acute. Violent, unlawful, or seriously disruptive conduct is fundamentally inconsistent with the principal function of teaching institutions which is to educate young people and prepare them for citizenship. [ Footnote 4/15 ] When such conduct occurs amidst a sizable group of impressionable young people, it creates an explosive atmosphere that requires a prompt and effective response.\nThus, warrantless searches of students by school administrators are reasonable when undertaken for those purposes.\nBut the majority's statement of the standard for evaluating the reasonableness of such searches is not suitably adapted to that end. The majority holds that\n\"a search of a student by a teacher or other school official will be 'justified at its inception' when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school. \"\nAnte at 469 U. S. 341 -342. This standard will permit teachers and school administrators to search students when they suspect that the search will reveal evidence of even the most trivial school regulation or precatory guideline for student behavior. The Court's standard for deciding whether a search is justified \"at its inception\" treats all violations of the rules of the school as though they were fungible. For the Court, a search for curlers and sunglasses in order to enforce the school dress code [ Footnote 4/16 ] is apparently just as important as a search for evidence of heroin addiction or violent gang activity.\nThe majority, however, does not contend that school administrators have a compelling need to search students in\norder to achieve optimum enforcement of minor school regulations. [ Footnote 4/17 ] To the contrary, when minor violations are involved, there is every indication that the informal school disciplinary process, with only minimum requirements of due process, [ Footnote 4/18 ] can function effectively without the power to search for enough evidence to prove a criminal case. In arguing that teachers and school administrators need the power to search students based on a lessened standard, the United States as amicus curiae relies heavily on empirical evidence of a contemporary crisis of violence and unlawful behavior that is seriously undermining the process of education in American schools. [ Footnote 4/19 ] A standard better attuned to this concern would permit teachers and school administrators to search a student when they have reason to believe that the search will uncover evidence that the student is violating the law or engaging in conduct that is seriously disruptive of school order, or the educational process.\nThis standard is properly directed at \"[t]he sole justification for the [warrantless] search.\" [ Footnote 4/20 ] In addition, a standard\nthat varies the extent of the permissible intrusion with the gravity of the suspected offense is also more consistent with common law experience and this Court's precedent. Criminal law has traditionally recognized a distinction between essentially regulatory offenses and serious violations of the peace, and graduated the response of the criminal justice system depending on the character of the violation. [ Footnote 4/21 ] The application of a similar distinction in evaluating the reasonableness of warrantless searches and seizures \"is not a novel idea.\" Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740 , 466 U. S. 750 (1984). [ Footnote 4/22 ]\nIn Welsh, police officers arrived at the scene of a traffic accident and obtained information indicating that the driver of the automobile involved was guilty of a first offense of\ndriving while intoxicated -- a civil violation with a maximum fine of $200. The driver had left the scene of the accident, and the officers followed the suspect to his home where they arrested him without a warrant. Absent exigent circumstances, the warrantless invasion of the home was a clear violation of Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573 (1980). In holding that the warrantless arrest for the \"noncriminal, traffic offense\" in Welsh was unconstitutional, the Court noted that\n\"application of the exigent-circumstances exception in the context of a home entry should rarely be sanctioned when there is probable cause to believe that only a minor offense . . . has been committed.\"\n466 U.S. at 466 U. S. 753 . The logic of distinguishing between minor and serious offenses in evaluating the reasonableness of school searches is almost too clear for argument. In order to justify the serious intrusion on the persons and privacy of young people that New Jersey asks this Court to approve, the State must identify \"some real immediate and serious consequences.\" McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451 , 335 U. S. 460 (1948) (Jackson, J., concurring, joined by Frankfurter, J.). [ Footnote 4/23 ] While school administrators have entirely legitimate reasons for adopting school regulations and guidelines for student behavior, the authorization of searches to enforce them \"displays a shocking lack of all sense of proportion.\" Id. 335 U. S. 459 . [ Footnote 4/24 ]\nThe majority offers weak deference to these principles of balance and decency by announcing that school searches will only be reasonable in scope \"when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction. \" Ante at 469 U. S. 342 (emphasis added). The majority offers no explanation why a two-part standard is necessary to evaluate the reasonableness of the ordinary school search. Significantly, in the balance of its opinion the Court pretermits any discussion of the nature of T.L.O.'s infraction of the \"no smoking\" rule.\nThe \"rider\" to the Court's standard for evaluating the reasonableness of the initial intrusion apparently is the Court's perception that its standard is overly generous and does not, by itself, achieve a fair balance between the administrator's right to search and the student's reasonable expectations of privacy. The Court's standard for evaluating the \"scope\" of reasonable school searches is obviously designed to prohibit physically intrusive searches of students by persons of the opposite sex for relatively minor offenses. The Court's effort to establish a standard that is, at once, clear enough to allow searches to be upheld in nearly every case, and flexible enough to prohibit obviously unreasonable intrusions of young adults' privacy only creates uncertainty in the extent of its resolve to prohibit the latter. Moreover, the majority's application of its standard in this case -- to permit a male administrator to rummage through the purse of a female high school student in order to obtain evidence that she was smoking\nin a bathroom -- raises grave doubts in my mind whether its effort will be effective. [ Footnote 4/25 ] Unlike the Court, I believe the nature of the suspected infraction is a matter of first importance in deciding whether any invasion of privacy is permissible.\nIII\nThe Court embraces the standard applied by the New Jersey Supreme Court as equivalent to its own, and then deprecates the state court's application of the standard as reflecting \"a somewhat crabbed notion of reasonableness.\" Ante at 469 U. S. 343 . There is no mystery, however, in the state court's finding that the search in this case was unconstitutional; the decision below was not based on a manipulation of reasonable suspicion, but on the trivial character of the activity that promoted the official search. The New Jersey Supreme Court wrote:\n\"We are satisfied that, when a school official has reasonable grounds to believe that a student possesses evidence of illegal activity or activity that would interfere with school discipline and order, the school official has the right to conduct a reasonable search for such evidence.\"\n\"In determining whether the school official has reasonable grounds, courts should consider the child's age, history, and school record, the prevalence and seriousness of the problem in the school to which the search was\ndirected, the exigency to make the search without delay, and the probative value and reliability of the information used as a justification for the search. [ Footnote 4/26 ]\"\nThe emphasized language in the state court's opinion focuses on the character of the rule infraction that is to be the object of the search.\nIn the view of the state court, there is a quite obvious and material difference between a search for evidence relating to violent or disruptive activity, and a search for evidence of a smoking rule violation. This distinction does not imply that a no-smoking rule is a matter of minor importance. Rather, like a rule that prohibits a student from being tardy, its occasional violation in a context that poses no threat of disrupting school order and discipline offers no reason to believe that an immediate search is necessary to avoid unlawful conduct, violence, or a serious impairment of the educational process.\nA correct understanding of the New Jersey court's standard explains why that court concluded in T.L.O.'s case that\n\"the assistant principal did not have reasonable grounds to believe that the student was concealing in her purse evidence of criminal activity or evidence of activity that would seriously interfere with school discipline or order. [ Footnote 4/27 ]\"\nThe importance of the nature of the rule infraction to the New Jersey Supreme Court's holding is evident from its brief explanation of the principal basis for its decision:\n\"A student has an expectation of privacy in the contents of her purse. Mere possession of cigarettes did not violate school rule or policy, since the school allowed smoking in designated areas. The contents of the handbag had no direct bearing on the infraction.\"\n\"The assistant principal's desire, legal in itself, to gather evidence to impeach the student's credibility at a\nhearing on the disciplinary infraction does not validate the search. [ Footnote 4/28 ]\"\nLike the New Jersey Supreme Court, I would view this case differently if the Assistant Vice Principal had reason to believe T.L.O.'s purse contained evidence of criminal activity, or of an activity that would seriously disrupt school discipline. There was, however, absolutely no basis for any such assumption -- not even a \"hunch.\"\nIn this case, Mr. Choplick overreacted to what appeared to be nothing more than a minor infraction -- a rule prohibiting smoking in the bathroom of the freshmen's and sophomores' building. [ Footnote 4/29 ] It is, of course, true that he actually found evidence of serious wrongdoing by T.L.O., but no one claims that the prior search may be justified by his unexpected discovery. As far as the smoking infraction is concerned, the search for cigarettes merely tended to corroborate a teacher's eyewitness account of T.L.O.'s violation of a minor regulation designed to channel student smoking behavior into designated locations. Because this conduct was neither unlawful nor significantly disruptive of school order or the educational process, the invasion of privacy associated with the forcible opening of T.L.O.'s purse was entirely unjustified at its inception.\nA review of the sampling of school search cases relied on by the Court demonstrates how different this case is from those\nin which there was indeed a valid justification for intruding on a student's privacy. In most of them the student was suspected of a criminal violation; [ Footnote 4/30 ] in the remainder either violence or substantial disruption of school order or the integrity of the academic process was at stake. [ Footnote 4/31 ] Few involved matters as trivial as the no-smoking rule violated by T.L.0., [ Footnote 4/32 ] The rule the Court adopts today is so open-ended that it may make the Fourth Amendment virtually meaningless in the school context. Although I agree that school administrators must have broad latitude to maintain order and discipline in our classrooms, that authority is not unlimited.\nIV\nThe schoolroom is the first opportunity most citizens have to experience the power of government. Through it passes every citizen and public official, from schoolteachers to\npolicemen and prison guards. The values they learn there, they take with them in life. One of our most cherished ideals is the one contained in the Fourth Amendment: that the government may not intrude on the personal privacy of its citizens without a warrant or compelling circumstance. The Court's decision today is a curious moral for the Nation's youth. Although the search of T.L.O.'s purse does not trouble today's majority, I submit that we are not dealing with \"matters relatively trivial to the welfare of the Nation. There are village tyrants as well as village Hampdens, but none who acts under color of law is beyond reach of the Constitution.\" West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.

See generally W. LaFave, Handbook on Criminal Law \u00a7 6 (1972).\nSome codes of student behavior also provide a system of graduated response by distinguishing between violent, unlawful, or seriously disruptive conduct, and conduct that will only warrant serious sanctions when the student engages in repetitive offenses.

S. 582 -583 (emphasis added), the Court noted that similar considerations require some variance in the requirements of due process in the school disciplinary context:\n\"[A]s a general rule notice and hearing should precede removal of the student from school. We agree . . ., however, that there are recurring situations in which prior notice and hearing cannot be insisted upon.

In such cases the necessary notice and rudimentary hearing should follow as soon as practicable. . . .\"\nIn McDonald police officers made a warrantless search of the office of an illegal \"numbers\" operation.

Whether there is reasonable necessity for a search without waiting to obtain a warrant certainly depends somewhat upon the gravity of the offense thought to be in progress as well as the hazards of the method of attempting to reach it. . . .

S. 236 , n. 6. In any case, the majority offers no rationale supporting its conclusion that a student detained by school officials for questioning, on reasonable suspicion that she has violated a school rule, is entitled to no more protection under the Fourth Amendment than a criminal suspect under custodial arrest.\nOne thing is clear under any standard -- the shocking strip searches that are described in some cases have no place in the schoolhouse.

Renfrow, 631 F.2d 91, 92-93 (CA7 1980) (\"It does not require a constitutional scholar to conclude that a nude search of a 13-year-old child is an invasion of constitutional rights of some magnitude\"), cert. denied 451 U.

When respondent, in response to the Assistant Vice Principal's questioning, denied that she had been smoking and claimed that she did not smoke at all, the Assistant Vice Principal demanded to see her purse. Upon opening the purse, he found a pack of cigarettes and also noticed a package of cigarette rolling papers that are commonly associated with the use of marihuana. He then proceeded to search the purse thoroughly and found some marihuana, a pipe, plastic bags, a fairly substantial amount of money, an index card containing a list of students who owed respondent money, and two letters that implicated her in marihuana dealing. Thereafter, the State brought delinquency charges against respondent in the Juvenile Court, which, after denying respondent's motion to suppress the evidence found in her purse, held that the Fourth Amendment applied to searches by school officials, but that the search in question was a reasonable one, and adjudged respondent to be a delinquent. The Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court affirmed the trial court's finding that there had been no Fourth Amendment violation, but vacated the adjudication of delinquency and remanded on other grounds. The New Jersey Supreme Court reversed and ordered the suppression of the evidence found in respondent's purse, holding that the search of the purse was unreasonable. Held: 1. The Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures applies to searches conducted by public school officials, and is not limited to searches carried out by law enforcement officers. Nor are school officials exempt from the Amendment's dictates by virtue of the special nature of their authority over schoolchildren. In carrying out searches and other functions pursuant to disciplinary policies mandated by state statutes, school officials act as representatives of the State, not merely as surrogates for the parents of students, and they cannot claim the parents immunity from the Fourth Amendment's strictures. Pp. 469 U. S. 333 -337. 2. Schoolchildren have legitimate expectations of privacy. They may find it necessary to carry with them a variety of legitimate, noncontraband items, and there is no reason to conclude that they have necessarily waived all rights to privacy in such items by bringing them onto school grounds. But striking the balance between schoolchildren's legitimate expectations of privacy and the school's equally legitimate need to maintain an environment in which learning can take place requires some easing of the restrictions to which searches by public authorities are ordinarily subject. Thus, school officials need not obtain a warrant before searching a student who is under their authority. Moreover, school officials need not be held subject to the requirement that searches be based on probable cause to believe that the subject of the search has violated or is violating the law. Rather, the legality of a search of a student should depend simply on the reasonableness, under all the circumstances, of the search. Determining the reasonableness of any search involves a determination of whether the search was justified at its inception and whether, as conducted, it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the interference in the first place. Under ordinary circumstances, the search of a student by a school official will be justified at its inception where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school. And such a search will be permissible in its scope when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search, and not excessively intrusive in light of the student's age and sex and the nature of the infraction. Pp. 469 U. S. 337 -343. 3. Under the above standard, the search in this case was not unreasonable for Fourth Amendment purposes. First, the initial search for cigarettes was reasonable. The report to the Assistant Vice Principal that respondent had been smoking warranted a reasonable suspicion that she had cigarettes in her purse, and thus the search was justified despite the fact that the cigarettes, if found, would constitute \"mere evidence\" of a violation of the no-smoking rule. Second, the discovery of the rolling papers then gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that respondent was carrying marihuana as well as cigarettes in her purse, and this suspicion justified the further exploration that turned up more evidence of drug-related activities.

JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court. We granted certiorari in this case to examine the appropriateness of the exclusionary rule as a remedy for searches carried out in violation of the Fourth Amendment by public school authorities. Our consideration of the proper application of the Fourth Amendment to the public schools, however, has led us to conclude that the search that gave rise to the case now before us did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Accordingly, we here address only the questions of the proper standard for assessing the legality of searches conducted by public school officials and the application of that standard to the facts of this case. I On March 7, 1980, a teacher at Piscataway High School in Middlesex County, N.J. discovered two girls smoking in a lavatory. One of the two girls was the respondent T.L.O, who at that time was a 14-year-old high school freshman. Because smoking in the lavatory was a violation of a school rule, the teacher took the two girls to the Principal's office, where they met with Assistant Vice Principal Theodore Choplick. In response to questioning by Mr. Choplick, T.L.O's companion admitted that she had violated the rule. T.L.O, however, denied that she had been smoking in the lavatory and claimed that she did not smoke at all. Mr. Choplick asked T.L.O to come into his private office and demanded to see her purse. Opening the purse, he found a pack of cigarettes, which he removed from the purse and held before T.L.O as he accused her of having lied to him. As he reached into the purse for the cigarettes, Mr. Choplick also noticed a package of cigarette rolling papers. In his experience, possession of rolling papers by high school students was closely associated with the use of marihuana. Suspecting that a closer examination of the purse might yield further evidence of drug use, Mr. Choplick proceeded to search the purse thoroughly. The search revealed a small amount of marihuana, a pipe, a number of empty plastic bags, a substantial quantity of money in one-dollar bills, an index card that appeared to be a list of students who owed T.L.O money, and two letters that implicated T.L.O in marihuana dealing. Mr. Choplick notified T.L.O's mother and the police, and turned the evidence of drug dealing over to the police. At the request of the police, T.L.O's mother took her daughter to police headquarters, where T.L.O confessed that she had been selling marihuana at the high school. On the basis of the confession and the evidence seized by Mr. Choplick, the State brought delinquency charges against T.L.O in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of Middlesex County. [ Footnote 1 ] Contending that Mr. Choplick's search of her purse violated the Fourth Amendment, T.L.O moved to suppress the evidence found in her purse as well as her confession, which, she argued, was tainted by the allegedly unlawful search. The Juvenile Court denied the motion to suppress. State ex rel. T.L.O., 178 N.J.Super. 329, 428 A.2d 1327 (1980). Although the court concluded that the Fourth Amendment did apply to searches carried out by school officials, it held that \"a school official may properly conduct a search of a student's person if the official has a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is in the process of being committed, or reasonable cause to believe that the search is necessary to maintain school discipline or enforce school policies.\" Id. at 341, 428 A.2d at 1333 (emphasis in original). Applying this standard, the court concluded that the search conducted by Mr. Choplick was a reasonable one. The initial decision to open the purse was justified by Mr. Choplick's well-founded suspicion that T.L.O had violated the rule forbidding smoking in the lavatory. Once the purse was open, evidence of marihuana violations was in plain view, and Mr. Choplick was entitled to conduct a thorough search to determine the nature and extent of T.L.O's drug-related activities. Id. at 343, 428 A.2d at 1334. Having denied the motion to suppress, the court on March 23, 1981, found T.L.O. to be a delinquent and on January 8, 1982, sentenced her to a year's probation. On appeal from the final judgment of the Juvenile Court, a divided Appellate Division affirmed the trial court's finding that there had been no Fourth Amendment violation, but vacated the adjudication of delinquency and remanded for a determination whether T.L.O. had knowingly and voluntarily waived her Fifth Amendment rights before confessing. State ex rel. T.L.O., 185 N.J.Super. 279, 448 A.2d 493 (1982). T.L.O. appealed the Fourth Amendment ruling, and the Supreme Court of New Jersey reversed the judgment of the Appellate Division and ordered the suppression of the evidence found in T.L.O.'s purse. State ex rel. T.L.O., 94 N.J. 331, 463 A.2d 934 (1983). The New Jersey Supreme Court agreed with the lower courts that the Fourth Amendment applies to searches conducted by school officials. The court also rejected the State of New Jersey's argument that the exclusionary rule should not be employed to prevent the use in juvenile proceedings of evidence unlawfully seized by school officials. Declining to consider whether applying the rule to the fruits of searches by school officials would have any deterrent value, the court held simply that the precedents of this Court establish that \"if an official search violates constitutional rights, the evidence is not admissible in criminal proceedings.\" Id. at 341, 463 A.2d at 939 (footnote omitted). With respect to the question of the legality of the search before it, the court agreed with the Juvenile Court that a warrantless search by a school official does not violate the Fourth Amendment so long as the official \"has reasonable grounds to believe that a student possesses evidence of illegal activity or activity that would interfere with school discipline and order.\" Id. at 346, 463 A.2d at 941-942. However, the court, with two justices dissenting, sharply disagreed with the Juvenile Court's conclusion that the search of the purse was reasonable. According to the majority, the contents of T.L.O.'s purse had no bearing on the accusation against T.L.O., for possession of cigarettes (as opposed to smoking them in the lavatory) did not violate school rules, and a mere desire for evidence that would impeach T.L.O.'s claim that she did not smoke cigarettes could not justify the search. Moreover, even if a reasonable suspicion that T.L.O. had cigarettes in her purse would justify a search, Mr. Choplick had no such suspicion, as no one had furnished him with any specific information that there were cigarettes in the purse. Finally, leaving aside the question whether Mr. Choplick was justified in opening the purse, the court held that the evidence of drug use that he saw inside did not justify the extensive \"rummaging\" through T.L.O.'s papers and effects that followed. Id. at 347, 463 A.2d at 942-943. We granted the State of New Jersey's petition for certiorari. 464 U.S. 991 (1983). Although the State had argued in the Supreme Court of New Jersey that the search of T.L.O.'s purse did not violate the Fourth Amendment, the petition for certiorari raised only the question whether the exclusionary rule should operate to bar consideration in juvenile delinquency proceedings of evidence unlawfully seized by a school official without the involvement of law enforcement officers. When this case was first argued last Term, the State conceded for the purpose of argument that the standard devised by the New Jersey Supreme Court for determining the legality of school searches was appropriate and that the court had correctly applied that standard; the State contended only that the remedial purposes of the exclusionary rule were not well served by applying it to searches conducted by public authorities not primarily engaged in law enforcement. Although we originally granted certiorari to decide the issue of the appropriate remedy in juvenile court proceedings for unlawful school searches, our doubts regarding the wisdom of deciding that question in isolation from the broader question of what limits, if any, the Fourth Amendment places on the activities of school authorities prompted us to order reargument on that question. [ Footnote 2 ] Having heard argument on the legality of the search of T.L.O.'s purse, we are satisfied that the search did not violate the Fourth Amendment. [ Footnote 3 ] II In determining whether the search at issue in this case violated the Fourth Amendment, we are faced initially with the question whether that Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures applies to searches conducted by public school officials. We hold that it does. It is now beyond dispute that \"the Federal Constitution, by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures by state officers.\" Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206 , 364 U. S. 213 (1960); accord, Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961); Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25 (1949). Equally indisputable is the proposition that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the rights of students against encroachment by public school officials: \"The Fourteenth Amendment, as now applied to the States, protects the citizen against the State itself and all of its creatures -- Boards of Education not excepted. These have, of course, important, delicate, and highly discretionary functions, but none that they may not perform within the limits of the Bill of Rights. That they are educating the young for citizenship is reason for scrupulous protection of Constitutional freedoms of the individual, if we are not to strangle the free mind at its source and teach youth to discount important principles of our government as mere platitudes.\" West Virginia State Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624 , 319 U. S. 637 (1943). These two propositions -- that the Fourth Amendment applies to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the actions of public school officials are subject to the limits placed on state action by the Fourteenth Amendment -- might appear sufficient to answer the suggestion that the Fourth Amendment does not proscribe unreasonable searches by school officials. On reargument, however, the State of New Jersey has argued that the history of the Fourth Amendment indicates that the Amendment was intended to regulate only searches and seizures carried out by law enforcement officers; accordingly, although public school officials are concededly state agents for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fourth Amendment creates no rights enforceable against them. [ Footnote 4 ] It may well be true that the evil toward which the Fourth Amendment was primarily directed was the resurrection of the pre-Revolutionary practice of using general warrants or \"writs of assistance\" to authorize searches for contraband by officers of the Crown. See United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1 , 433 U. S. 7 -8 (1977); Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616 , 116 U. S. 624 -629 (1886). But this Court has never limited the Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures to operations conducted by the police. Rather, the Court has long spoken of the Fourth Amendment's strictures as restraints imposed upon \"governmental action\" -- that is, \"upon the activities of sovereign authority.\" Burdeau v. McDowell, 256 U. S. 465 , 256 U. S. 475 (1921). Accordingly, we have held the Fourth Amendment applicable to the activities of civil as well as criminal authorities: building inspectors, see Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U. S. 523 , 387 U. S. 528 (1967), Occupational Safety and Health Act inspectors, see Marshall v. Barlow's, Inc., 436 U. S. 307 , 436 U. S. 312 -313 (1978), and even firemen entering privately owned premises to battle a fire, see Michigan v. Tyler, 436 U. S. 499 , 436 U. S. 506 (1978), are all subject to the restraints imposed by the Fourth Amendment. As we observed in Camara v. Municipal Court, supra, \"[t]he basic purpose of this Amendment, as recognized in countless decisions of this Court, is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.\" 387 U.S. at 387 U. S. 528 . Because the individual's interest in privacy and personal security \"suffers whether the government's motivation is to investigate violations of criminal laws or breaches of other statutory or regulatory standards,\" Marshall v. Barlow's, Inc., supra, at 436 U. S. 312 -313, it would be \"anomalous to say that the individual and his private property are fully protected by the Fourth Amendment only when the individual is suspected of criminal behavior.\" Camara v. Municipal Court, supra, at 387 U. S. 530 . Notwithstanding the general applicability of the Fourth Amendment to the activities of civil authorities, a few courts have concluded that school officials are exempt from the dictates of the Fourth Amendment by virtue of the special nature of their authority over schoolchildren. See, e.g., R.C.M. v. State, 660 S.W.2d 552 (Tex.App.1983). Teachers and school administrators, it is said, act in loco parentis in their dealings with students: their authority is that of the parent, not the State, and is therefore not subject to the limits of the Fourth Amendment. Ibid. Such reasoning is in tension with contemporary reality and the teachings of this Court. We have held school officials subject to the commands of the First Amendment, see Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U. S. 503 (1969), and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, see Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565 (1975). If school authorities are state actors for purposes of the constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression and due process, it is difficult to understand why they should be deemed to be exercising parental rather than public authority when conducting searches of their students. More generally, the Court has recognized that \"the concept of parental delegation\" as a source of school authority is not entirely \"consonant with compulsory education laws.\" Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651 , 430 U. S. 662 (1977). Today's public school officials do not merely exercise authority voluntarily conferred on them by individual parents; rather, they act in furtherance of publicly mandated educational and disciplinary policies. See, e.g., the opinion in State ex rel. T.L.O., 94 N.J. at 343, 463 A.2d at 934, 940, describing the New Jersey statutes regulating school disciplinary policies and establishing the authority of school officials over their students. In carrying out searches and other disciplinary functions pursuant to such policies, school officials act as representatives of the State, not merely as surrogates for the parents, and they cannot claim the parents' immunity from the strictures of the Fourth Amendment. III To hold that the Fourth Amendment applies to searches conducted by school authorities is only to begin the inquiry into the standards governing such searches. Although the underlying command of the Fourth Amendment is always that searches and seizures be reasonable, what is reasonable depends on the context within which a search takes place. The determination of the standard of reasonableness governing any specific class of searches requires \"balancing the need to search against the invasion which the search entails.\" Camara v. Municipal Court, supra, at 387 U. S. 536 -537. On one side of the balance are arrayed the individual's legitimate expectations of privacy and personal security; on the other, the government's need for effective methods to deal with breaches of public order. We have recognized that even a limited search of the person is a substantial invasion of privacy. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 , 392 U. S. 24 -25 (1967). We have also recognized that searches of closed items of personal luggage are intrusions on protected privacy interests, for \"the Fourth Amendment provides protection to the owner of every container that conceals its contents from plain view.\" United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798 , 456 U. S. 822 -823 (1982). A search of a child's person or of a closed purse or other bag carried on her person, [ Footnote 5 ] no less than a similar search carried out on an adult, is undoubtedly a severe violation of subjective expectations of privacy. Of course, the Fourth Amendment does not protect subjective expectations of privacy that are unreasonable or otherwise \"illegitimate.\" See, e.g., Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517 (1984); Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448 U. S. 98 (1980). To receive the protection of the Fourth Amendment, an expectation of privacy must be one that society is \"prepared to recognize as legitimate.\" Hudson v. Palmer, supra, at 468 U. S. 526 . The State of New Jersey has argued that, because of the pervasive supervision to which children in the schools are necessarily subject, a child has virtually no legitimate expectation of privacy in articles of personal property \"unnecessarily\" carried into a school. This argument has two factual premises: (1) the fundamental incompatibility of expectations of privacy with the maintenance of a sound educational environment; and (2) the minimal interest of the child in bringing any items of personal property into the school. Both premises are severely flawed. Although this Court may take notice of the difficulty of maintaining discipline in the public schools today, the situation is not so dire that students in the schools may claim no legitimate expectations of privacy. We have recently recognized that the need to maintain order in a prison is such that prisoners retain no legitimate expectations of privacy in their cells, but it goes almost without saying that \"[t]he prisoner and the schoolchild stand in wholly different circumstances, separated by the harsh facts of criminal conviction and incarceration.\" Ingraham v. Wright, supra, at 430 U. S. 669 . We are not yet ready to hold that the schools and the prisons need be equated for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. Nor does the State's suggestion that children have no legitimate need to bring personal property into the schools seem well anchored in reality. Students at a minimum must bring to school not only the supplies needed for their studies, but also keys, money, and the necessaries of personal hygiene and grooming. In addition, students may carry on their persons or in purses or wallets such nondisruptive yet highly personal items as photographs, letters, and diaries. Finally, students may have perfectly legitimate reasons to carry with them articles of property needed in connection with extracurricular or recreational activities. In short, schoolchildren may find it necessary to carry with them a variety of legitimate, noncontraband items, and there is no reason to conclude that they have necessarily waived all rights to privacy in such items merely by bringing them onto school grounds. Against the child's interest in privacy must be set the substantial interest of teachers and administrators in maintaining discipline in the classroom and on school grounds. Maintaining order in the classroom has never been easy, but in recent years, school disorder has often taken particularly ugly forms: drug use and violent crime in the schools have become major social problems. See generally 1 NIE, U.S. Dept. of Health, Education and Welfare, Violent Schools -- Safe Schools: The Safe School Study Report to the Congress (1978). Even in schools that have been spared the most severe disciplinary problems, the preservation of order and a proper educational environment requires close supervision of schoolchildren, as well as the enforcement of rules against conduct that would be perfectly permissible if undertaken by an adult. \"Events calling for discipline are frequent occurrences and sometimes require immediate, effective action.\" Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. at 419 U. S. 580 . Accordingly, we have recognized that maintaining security and order in the schools requires a certain degree of flexibility in school disciplinary procedures, and we have respected the value of preserving the informality of the student-teacher relationship. See id. at 419 U. S. 582 -583; Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. at 430 U. S. 680 -682. How, then, should we strike the balance between the schoolchild's legitimate expectations of privacy and the school's equally legitimate need to maintain an environment in which learning can take place? It is evident that the school setting requires some easing of the restrictions to which searches by public authorities are ordinarily subject. The warrant requirement, in particular, is unsuited to the school environment: requiring a teacher to obtain a warrant before searching a child suspected of an infraction of school rules (or of the criminal law) would unduly interfere with the maintenance of the swift and informal disciplinary procedures needed in the schools. Just as we have in other cases dispensed with the warrant requirement when \"the burden of obtaining a warrant is likely to frustrate the governmental purpose behind the search,\" Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. at 387 U. S. 532 -533, we hold today that school officials need not obtain a warrant before searching a student who is under their authority. The school setting also requires some modification of the level of suspicion of illicit activity needed to justify a search. Ordinarily, a search -- even one that may permissibly be carried out without a warrant -- must be based upon \"probable cause\" to believe that a violation of the law has occurred. See, e.g., Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U. S. 266 , 413 U. S. 273 (1973); Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40 , 392 U. S. 62 -66 (1968). However, \"probable cause\" is not an irreducible requirement of a valid search. The fundamental command of the Fourth Amendment is that searches and seizures be reasonable, and although \"both the concept of probable cause and the requirement of a warrant bear on the reasonableness of a search, . . . in certain limited circumstances neither is required.\" J., concurring). Thus, we have in a number of cases recognized the legality of searches and seizures based on suspicions that, although \"reasonable,\" do not rise to the level of probable cause. See, e.g., Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968); United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U. S. 873 , 422 U. S. 881 (195); Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S. 648 , 440 U. S. 654 -655 (1979); United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543 (1976); cf. Camara v. Municipal Court, supra, at 387 U. S. 534 -539. Where a careful balancing of governmental and private interests suggests that the public interest is best served by a Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness that stops short of probable cause, we have not hesitated to adopt such a standard. We join the majority of courts that have examined this issue [ Footnote 6 ] in concluding that the accommodation of the privacy interests of schoolchildren with the substantial need of teachers and administrators for freedom to maintain order in the schools does not require strict adherence to the requirement that searches be based on probable cause to believe that the subject of the search has violated or is violating the law. Rather, the legality of a search of a student should depend simply on the reasonableness, under all the circumstances, of the search. Determining the reasonableness of any search involves a twofold inquiry: first, one must consider \"whether the . . . action was justified at its inception,\" Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. at 392 U. S. 20 ; second, one must determine whether the search as actually conducted \"was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place,\" ibid. Under ordinary circumstances, a search of a student by a teacher or other school official [ Footnote 7 ] will be \"justified at its inception\" when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school. [ Footnote 8 ] Such a search will be permissible in its scope when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction. [ Footnote 9 ] This standard will, we trust, neither unduly burden the efforts of school authorities to maintain order in their schools nor authorize unrestrained intrusions upon the privacy of schoolchildren. By focusing attention on the question of reasonableness, the standard will spare teachers and school administrators the necessity of schooling themselves in the niceties of probable cause and permit them to regulate their conduct according to the dictates of reason and common sense. At the same time, the reasonableness standard should ensure that the interests of students will be invaded no more than is necessary to achieve the legitimate end of preserving order in the schools. IV There remains the question of the legality of the search in this case. We recognize that the \"reasonable grounds\" standard applied by the New Jersey Supreme Court in its consideration of this question is not substantially different from the standard that we have adopted today. Nonetheless, we believe that the New Jersey court's application of that standard to strike down the search of T.L.O.'s purse reflects a somewhat crabbed notion of reasonableness. Our review of the facts surrounding the search leads us to conclude that the search was in no sense unreasonable for Fourth Amendment purposes. [ Footnote 10 ] The incident that gave rise to this case actually involved two separate searches, with the first -- the search for cigarettes -- providing the suspicion that gave rise to the second -- the search for marihuana. Although it is the fruits of the second search that are at issue here, the validity of the search for marihuana must depend on the reasonableness of the initial search for cigarettes, as there would have been no reason to suspect that T.L.O. possessed marihuana had the first search not taken place. Accordingly, it is to the search for cigarettes that we first turn our attention. The New Jersey Supreme Court pointed to two grounds for its holding that the search for cigarettes was unreasonable. First, the court observed that possession of cigarettes was not in itself illegal or a violation of school rules. Because the contents of T.L.O.'s purse would therefore have \"no direct bearing on the infraction\" of which she was accused (smoking in a lavatory where smoking was prohibited), there was no reason to search her purse. [ Footnote 11 ] Second, even assuming that a search of T.L.O.'s purse might under some circumstances be reasonable in light of the accusation made against T.L.O., the New Jersey court concluded that Mr. Choplick in this particular case had no reasonable grounds to suspect that T.L.O. had cigarettes in her purse. At best, according to the court, Mr. Choplick had \"a good hunch.\" 94 N.J. at 347, 463 A.2d at 942. Both these conclusions are implausible. T.L.O. had been accused of smoking, and had denied the accusation in the strongest possible terms when she stated that she did not smoke at all. Surely it cannot be said that under these circumstances, T.L.O.'s possession of cigarettes would be irrelevant to the charges against her or to her response to those charges. T.L.O.'s possession of cigarettes, once it was discovered, would both corroborate the report that she had been smoking and undermine the credibility of her defense to the charge of smoking. To be sure, the discovery of the cigarettes would not prove that T.L.O. had been smoking in the lavatory; nor would it, strictly speaking, necessarily be inconsistent with her claim that she did not smoke at all. But it is universally recognized that evidence, to be relevant to an inquiry, need not conclusively prove the ultimate fact in issue, but only have \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Fed.Rule Evid. 401. The relevance of T.L.O.'s possession of cigarettes to the question whether she had been smoking and to the credibility of her denial that she smoked supplied the necessary \"nexus\" between the item searched for and the infraction under investigation. See Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294 , 387 U. S. 306 -307 (1967). Thus, if Mr. Choplick in fact had a reasonable suspicion that T.L.O. had cigarettes in her purse, the search was justified despite the fact that the cigarettes, if found, would constitute \"mere evidence\" of a violation. Ibid. Of course, the New Jersey Supreme Court also held that Mr. Choplick had no reasonable suspicion that the purse would contain cigarettes. This conclusion is puzzling. A teacher had reported that T.L.O. was smoking in the lavatory. Certainly this report gave Mr. Choplick reason to suspect that T.L.O. was carrying cigarettes with her; and if she did have cigarettes, her purse was the obvious place in which to find them. Mr. Choplick's suspicion that there were cigarettes in the purse was not an \"inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch,'\" Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. at 392 U. S. 27 ; rather, it was the sort of \"common-sense conclusio[n] about human behavior\" upon which \"practical people\" -- including government officials -- are entitled to rely. United States v. Cortez, 449 U. S. 411 , 449 U. S. 418 (1981). Of course, even if the teacher's report were true, T.L.O. might not have had a pack of cigarettes with her; she might have borrowed a cigarette from someone else or have been sharing a cigarette with another student. But the requirement of reasonable suspicion is not a requirement of absolute certainty: \"sufficient probability, not certainty, is the touchstone of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment. . . .\" Hill v. California, 401 U. S. 797 , 401 U. S. 804 (1971). Because the hypothesis that T.L.O. was carrying cigarettes in her purse was itself not unreasonable, it is irrelevant that other hypotheses were also consistent with the teacher's accusation. Accordingly, it cannot be said that Mr. Choplick acted unreasonably when he examined T.L.O.'s purse to see if it contained cigarettes. [ Footnote 12 ] Our conclusion that Mr. Choplick's decision to open T.L.O.'s purse was reasonable brings us to the question of the further search for marihuana once the pack of cigarettes was located. The suspicion upon which the search for marihuana was founded was provided when Mr. Choplick observed a package of rolling papers in the purse as he removed the pack of cigarettes. Although T.L.O. does not dispute the reasonableness of Mr. Choplick's belief that the rolling papers indicated the presence of marihuana, she does contend that the scope of the search Mr. Choplick conducted exceeded permissible bounds when he seized and read certain letters that implicated T.L.O. in drug dealing. This argument, too, is unpersuasive. The discovery of the rolling papers concededly gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that T.L.O. was carrying marihuana as well as cigarettes in her purse. This suspicion justified further exploration of T.L.O.'s purse, which turned up more evidence of drug-related activities: a pipe, a number of plastic bags of the type commonly used to store marihuana, a small quantity of marihuana, and a fairly substantial amount of money. Under these circumstances, it was not unreasonable to extend the search to a separate zippered compartment of the purse; and when a search of that compartment revealed an index card containing a list of \"people who owe me money\" as well as two letters, the inference that T.L.O. was involved in marihuana trafficking was substantial enough to justify Mr. Choplick in examining the letters to determine whether they contained any further evidence. In short, we cannot conclude that the search for marihuana was unreasonable in any respect. Because the search resulting in the discovery of the evidence of marihuana dealing by T.L.O. was reasonable, the New Jersey Supreme Court's decision to exclude that evidence from T.L.O.'s juvenile delinquency proceedings on Fourth Amendment grounds was erroneous. Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Jersey is Reversed. T.L.O. also received a 3-day suspension from school for smoking cigarettes in a nonsmoking area and a 7-day suspension for possession of marihuana. On T.L.O.'s motion, the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, set aside the 7-day suspension on the ground that it was based on evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment. (T.L.O.) v. Piscataway Bd. of Ed., No. C.2865-79 (Super.Ct. N.J. Ch.Div., Mar. 31, 1980). The Board of Education apparently did not appeal the decision of the Chancery Division. State and federal courts considering these questions have struggled to accommodate the interests protected by the Fourth Amendment and the interest of the States in providing a safe environment conducive to education in the public schools. Some courts have resolved the tension between these interests by giving full force to one or the other side of the balance. Thus, in a number of cases courts have held that school officials conducting in-school searches of students are private parties acting in loco parentis and are therefore not subject to the constraints of the Fourth Amendment. See, e.g., D. R. C. v. State, 646 P.2d 252 (Alaska App.1982); In re G., 11 Cal. App. 3d 1193 , 90 Cal. Rptr. 361 (1970); In re Donaldson, 269 Cal. App. 2d 509 , 75 Cal. Rptr. 220 (1969); R.C.M. v. State, 660 S.W.2d 552 (Tex.App.1983); Mercer v. State, 450 S.W.2d 715 (Tex.Civ.App.1970). At least one court has held, on the other hand, that the Fourth Amendment applies in full to in-school searches by school officials and that a search conducted without probable cause is unreasonable, see State v. Mora, 307 So. 2d 317 (La.), vacated, 423 U.S. 809 (1975), on remand, 330 So. 2d 900 (La.1976); others have held or suggested that the probable cause standard is applicable at least where the police are involved in a search, see M. v. Board of Ed. Ball-Chatham Community Unit School Dist. No. 5, 429 F. Supp. 288 , 292 (SD Ill.1977); Picha v. Wielgos, 410 F. Supp. 1214 , 1219-1221 (ND Ill.1976); State v. Young, 234 Ga. 488, 498, 216 S.E.2d 586 , 594 (1975); or where the search is highly intrusive, See M.M. v. Anker, 607 F.2d 588, 589 (CA2 1979). The majority of courts that have addressed the issue of the Fourth Amendment in the schools have, like the Supreme Court of New Jersey in this case, reached a middle position: the Fourth Amendment applies to searches conducted by school authorities, but the special needs of the school environment require assessment of the legality of such searches against a standard less exacting than that of probable cause. These courts have, by and large, upheld warrantless searches by school authorities provided that they are supported by a reasonable suspicion that the search will uncover evidence of an infraction of school disciplinary rules or a violation of the law. See, e.g., Tarter v. Raybuck, No. 83-3174 (CA6, Aug. 31, 1984); Bilorey v. Brown, 738 F.2d 1462 (CA9 1984); Hortol v. Goose Creek Independent School Dist., 690 F.2d 470 (CA5 1982); Bellnier v. Lund, 438 F. Supp. 47 (NDNY 1977); M. v. Board of Ed. Ball-Chatham Community Unit School Dist. No. 5, supra; In re W., 29 Cal. App. 3d 777 , 105 Cal. Rptr. 775 (1973); State v. Baccino, 282 A.2d 869 (Del. Super.1971); State v. D.T.W., 425 So. 2d 1383 (Fla.App.1983); State v. Young, supra; In re J.A. 85 Ill.App.3d 567, 406 N.E.2d 958 (1980); People v. Ward, 62 Mich.App. 46, 233 N.W.2d 180 (1975); Doe v. State, 88 N.M. 347, 540 P.2d 827 (App.1975); People v. D., 34 N.Y.2d 483, 315 N.E.2d 466 (1974); State v. McKinnon, 88 Wash. 2d 75 , 558 P.2d 781 (1977); In re L.L., 90 Wis.2d 585, 280 N.W.2d 343 (App.1979). Although few have considered the matter, courts have also split over whether the exclusionary rule is an appropriate remedy for Fourth Amendment violations committed by school authorities. The Georgia courts have held that although the Fourth Amendment applies to the schools, the exclusionary rule does not. See, e.g., State v. Young, supra; State v. Lamb, 137 Ga.App. 437, 224 S.E.2d 51 (1976). Other jurisdictions have applied the rule to exclude the fruits of unlawful school searches from criminal trials and delinquency proceedings. See State v. Mora, supra; People v. D., supra. In holding that the search of T.L.O.'s purse did not violate the Fourth Amendment, we do not implicitly determine that the exclusionary rule applies to the fruits of unlawful searches conducted by school authorities. The question whether evidence should be excluded from a criminal proceeding involves two discrete inquiries: whether the evidence was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and whether the exclusionary rule is the appropriate remedy for the violation. Neither question is logically antecedent to the other, for a negative answer to either question is sufficient to dispose of the case. Thus, our determination that the search at issue in this case did not violate the Fourth Amendment implies no particular resolution of the question of the applicability of the exclusionary rule. Cf. Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651 (1977) (holding that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment applies only to punishments imposed after criminal convictions and hence does not apply to the punishment of schoolchildren by public school officials). We do not address the question, not presented by this case, whether a schoolchild has a legitimate expectation of privacy in lockers, desks, or other school property provided for the storage of school supplies. Nor do we express any opinion on the standards of any governing searches of such areas by school officials or by other public authorities acting at the request of school officials. Compare Zamora v. Pomeroy, 639 F.2d 662, 670 (CA10 1981) (\"Inasmuch as the school had assumed joint control of the locker it cannot be successfully maintained that the school did not have a right to inspect it\"), and People v. Overton, 24 N.Y.2d 522, 249 N.E.2d 366 (1969) (school administrators have power to consent to search of a student's locker), with State v. Engerud, 94 N.J. 331, 348, 463 A.2d 934 , 943 (1983) (\"We are satisfied that in the context of this case the student had an expectation of privacy in the contents of his locker. . . . For the four years of high school, the school locker is a home away from home. In it the student stores the kind of personal effects' protected by the Fourth Amendment\"). See cases cited in n. 2 supra. We here consider only searches carried out by school authorities acting alone and on their own authority. This case does not present the question of the appropriate standard for assessing the legality of searches conducted by school officials in conjunction with or at the behest of law enforcement agencies, and we express no opinion on that question. Cf. Picha v. Wielgos, 410 F. Supp. 1214 , 1219-1221 (ND.Ill. 1976) (holding probable cause standard applicable to searches involving the police). We do not decide whether individualized suspicion is an essential element of the reasonableness standard we adopt for searches by school authorities. In other contexts, however, we have held that although \"some quantum of individualized suspicion is usually a prerequisite to a constitutional search or seizure[,] . . . the Fourth Amendment imposes no irreducible requirement of such suspicion.\" United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543 , 428 U. S. 560 -561 (1976). See also Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U. S. 523 (1967). Exceptions to the requirement of individualized suspicion are generally appropriate only where the privacy interests implicated by a search are minimal and where \"other safeguards\" are available \"to assure that the individual's reasonable expectation of privacy is not subject to the discretion of the official in the field.'\" Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S. 648 , 440 U. S. 654 -655 (1979) (citation omitted). Because the search of T.L.O.'s purse was based upon an individualized suspicion that she had violated school rules, see infra, at 469 U. S. 343 -347, we need not consider the circumstances that might justify school authorities in conducting searches unsupported by individualized suspicion. Our reference to the nature of the infraction is not intended as an endorsement of JUSTICE STEVENS' suggestion that some rules regarding student conduct are by nature too \"trivial\" to justify a search based upon reasonable suspicion. See post at 469 U. S. 377 -382. We are unwilling to adopt a standard under which the legality of a search is dependent upon a judge's evaluation of the relative importance of various school rules. The maintenance of discipline in the schools requires not only that students be restrained from assaulting one another, abusing drugs and alcohol, and committing other crimes, but also that students conform themselves to the standards of conduct prescribed by school authorities. We have \"repeatedly emphasized the need for affirming the comprehensive authority of the States and of school officials, consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards, to prescribe and control conduct in the schools.\" Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U. S. 503 , 393 U. S. 507 (1969). The promulgation of a rule forbidding specified conduct presumably reflects a judgment on the part of school officials that such conduct is destructive of school order or of a proper educational environment. Absent any suggestion that the rule violates some substantive constitutional guarantee, the courts should, as a general matter, defer to that judgment and refrain from attempting to distinguish between rules that are important to the preservation of order in the schools and rules that are not. Of course, New Jersey may insist on a more demanding standard under its own Constitution or statutes. In that case, its courts would not purport to be applying the Fourth Amendment when they invalidate a search. JUSTICE STEVENS interprets these statements as a holding that enforcement of the school's smoking regulations was not sufficiently related to the goal of maintaining discipline or order in the school to justify a search under the standard adopted by the New Jersey court. See post at 469 U. S. 382 -384. We do not agree that this is an accurate characterization of the New Jersey Supreme Court's opinion. The New Jersey court did not hold that the school's smoking rules were unrelated to the goal of maintaining discipline or order, nor did it suggest that a search that would produce evidence bearing directly on an accusation that a student had violated the smoking rules would be impermissible under the court's reasonable-suspicion standard; rather, the court concluded that any evidence a search of T.L.O.'s purse was likely to produce would not have a sufficiently direct bearing on the infraction to justify a search -- a conclusion with which we cannot agree for the reasons set forth infra, at 469 U. S. 345 . JUSTICE STEVENS' suggestion that the New Jersey Supreme Court's decision rested on the perceived triviality of the smoking infraction appears to be a reflection of his own views rather than those of the New Jersey court. T.L.O. contends that even if it was reasonable for Mr. Choplick to open her purse to look for cigarettes, it was not reasonable for him to reach in and take the cigarettes out of her purse once he found them. Had he not removed the cigarettes from the purse, she asserts, he would not have observed the rolling papers that suggested the presence of marihuana, and the search for marihuana could not have taken place. T.L.O.'s argument is based on the fact that the cigarettes were not \"contraband,\" as no school rule forbade her to have them. Thus, according to T.L.O., the cigarettes were not subject to seizure or confiscation by school authorities, and Mr. Choplick was not entitled to take them out of T.L.O.'s purse regardless of whether he was entitled to peer into the purse to see if they were there. Such hairsplitting argumentation has no place in an inquiry addressed to the issue of reasonableness. If Mr. Choplick could permissibly search T.L.O.'s purse for cigarettes, it hardly seems reasonable to suggest that his natural reaction to finding them -- picking them up -- could be a constitutional violation. We find that neither in opening the purse nor in reaching into it to remove the cigarettes did Mr. Choplick violate the Fourth Amendment. JUSTICE POWELL, with whom JUSTICE O'CONNOR joins, concurring. I agree with the Court's decision, and generally with its opinion. I would place greater emphasis, however, on the special characteristics of elementary and secondary schools that make it unnecessary to afford students the same constitutional protections granted adults and juveniles in a nonschool setting. In any realistic sense, students within the school environment have a lesser expectation of privacy than members of the population generally. They spend the school hours in close association with each other, both in the classroom and during recreation periods. The students in a particular class often know each other and their teachers quite well. Of necessity, teachers have a degree of familiarity with, and authority over, their students that is unparalleled except perhaps in the relationship between parent and child. It is simply unrealistic to think that students have the same subjective expectation of privacy as the population generally. But for purposes of deciding this case, I can assume that children in school -- no less than adults -- have privacy interests that society is prepared to recognize as legitimate. However one may characterize their privacy expectations, students properly are afforded some constitutional protections. In an often quoted statement, the Court said that students do not \"shed their constitutional rights . . . at the schoolhouse gate.\" Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U. S. 503 , 393 U. S. 506 (1969). The Court also has \"emphasized the need for affirming the comprehensive authority of the states and of school officials . . . to prescribe and control conduct in the schools.\" Id. at 393 U. S. 507 . See also Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U. S. 97 , 393 U. S. 104 (1968). The Court has balanced the interests of the student against the school officials' need to maintain discipline by recognizing qualitative differences between the constitutional remedies to which students and adults are entitled. In Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565 (1975), the Court recognized a constitutional right to due process, and yet was careful to limit the exercise of this right by a student who challenged a disciplinary suspension. The only process found to be \"due\" was notice and a hearing described as \"rudimentary\"; it amounted to no more than \"the disciplinarian . . . informally discuss[ing] the alleged misconduct with the student minutes after it has occurred.\" Id. at 419 U. S. 581 -582. In Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651 (1977), we declined to extend the Eighth Amendment to prohibit the use of corporal punishment of schoolchildren as authorized by Florida law. We emphasized in that opinion that familiar constraints in the school, and also in the community, provide substantial protection against the violation of constitutional rights by school authorities. \"[A]t the end of the school day, the child is invariably free to return home. Even while at school, the child brings with him the support of family and friends and is rarely apart from teachers and other pupils who may witness and protest any instances of mistreatment.\" Id. at 430 U. S. 670 . The Ingraham Court further pointed out that the \"openness of the public school and its supervision by the community afford significant safeguards\" against the violation of constitutional rights. Ibid. The special relationship between teacher and student also distinguishes the setting within which schoolchildren operate. Law enforcement officers function as adversaries of criminal suspects. These officers have the responsibility to investigate criminal activity, to locate and arrest those who violate our laws, and to facilitate the charging and bringing of such persons to trial. Rarely does this type of adversarial relationship exist between school authorities and pupils. [ Footnote 2/1 ] Instead, there is a commonality of interests between teachers and their pupils. The attitude of the typical teacher is one of personal responsibility for the student's welfare as well as for his education. The primary duty of school officials and teachers, as the Court states, is the education and training of young people. A State has a compelling interest in assuring that the schools meet this responsibility. Without first establishing discipline and maintaining order, teachers cannot begin to educate their students. And apart from education, the school has the obligation to protect pupils from mistreatment by other children, and also to protect teachers themselves from violence by the few students whose conduct in recent years has prompted national concern. For me, it would be unreasonable and at odds with history to argue that the full panoply of constitutional rules applies with the same force and effect in the schoolhouse as it does in the enforcement of criminal laws. [ Footnote 2/2 ] In sum, although I join the Court's opinion and its holding, [ Footnote 2/3 ] my emphasis is somewhat different. Unlike police officers, school authorities have no law enforcement responsibility or indeed any obligation to be familiar with the criminal laws. Of course, as illustrated by this case, school authorities have a layman's familiarity with the types of crimes that occur frequently in our schools: the distribution and use of drugs, theft, and even violence against teachers as well as fellow students. As noted above, decisions of this Court have never held to the contrary. The law recognizes a host of distinctions between the rights and duties of children and those of adults. See Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565 , 419 U. S. 591 (1975) (POWELL, J., dissenting.) The Court's holding is that \"when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that [a] search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school,\" a search of the student's person or belongings is justified. Ante at 469 U. S. 342 . This is in accord with the Court's summary of the views of a majority of the state and federal courts that have addressed this issue. See ante at 469 U. S. 332 -333, n. 2. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concurring in the judgment. I join the judgment of the Court and agree with much that is said in its opinion. I write separately, however, because I believe the Court omits a crucial step in its analysis of whether a school search must be based upon probable cause. The Court correctly states that we have recognized limited exceptions to the probable cause requirement \"[w]here a careful balancing of governmental and private interests suggests that the public interest is best served\" by a lesser standard. Ante at 469 U. S. 341 . I believe that we have used such a balancing test, rather than strictly applying the Fourth Amendment's Warrant and Probable-Cause Clause, only when we were confronted with \"a special law enforcement need for greater flexibility.\" Florida v. Royer, 460 U. S. 491 , 460 U. S. 514 (1983) (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting). I pointed out in United States v. Place, 462 U. S. 696 (1983): \"While the Fourth Amendment speaks in terms of freedom from unreasonable [searches], the Amendment does not leave the reasonableness of most [searches] to the judgment of courts or government officers; the Framers of the Amendment balanced the interests involved and decided that a [search] is reasonable only if supported by a judicial warrant based on probable cause. See Texas v. Brown, 460 U. S. 730 , 460 U. S. 744 -745 (1983) (POWELL, J., concurring); United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56 , 339 U. S. 70 (1950) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).\" Id. at 462 U. S. 722 (opinion concurring in judgment). See also Dunaway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200 , 442 U. S. 213 -214 (1979); United States v. United States District Court, 407 U. S. 297 , 407 U. S. 315 -316 (1972). Only in those exceptional circumstances in which special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement, make the warrant and probable cause requirement impracticable, is a court entitled to substitute its balancing of interests for that of the Framers. Thus, for example, in determining that police can conduct a limited \"stop and frisk\" upon less than probable cause, this Court relied upon the fact that \"as a practical matter\" the stop and frisk could not be subjected to a warrant and probable cause requirement, because a law enforcement officer must be able to take immediate steps to assure himself that the person he has stopped to question is not armed with a weapon that could be used against him. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 , 392 U. S. 20 -21, 392 U. S. 23 -24 (1968). Similarly, this Court's holding that a roving Border Patrol may stop a car and briefly question its occupants upon less than probable cause was based in part upon \"the absence of practical alternatives for policing the border.\" United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U. S. 873 , 422 U. S. 881 (1975). See also Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032 , 463 U. S. 1049 , n. 14 (1983); United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543 , 428 U. S. 557 (1976); Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U. S. 523 , 387 U. S. 537 (1967). The Court's implication that the balancing test is the rule rather than the exception is troubling for me because it is unnecessary in this case. The elementary and secondary school setting presents a special need for flexibility justifying a departure from the balance struck by the Framers. As JUSTICE POWELL notes, \"[w]ithout first establishing discipline and maintaining order, teachers cannot begin to educate their students.\" Ante at 469 U. S. 350 . Maintaining order in the classroom can be a difficult task. A single teacher often must watch over a large number of students, and, as any parent knows, children at certain ages are inclined to test the outer boundaries of acceptable conduct and to imitate the misbehavior of a peer if that misbehavior is not dealt with quickly. Every adult remembers from his own schooldays the havoc a water pistol or peashooter can wreak until it is taken away. Thus, the Court has recognized that \"[e]vents calling for discipline are frequent occurrences and sometimes require immediate, effective action.\" Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565 , 419 U. S. 580 (1975). Indeed, because drug use and possession of weapons have become increasingly common among young people, an immediate response frequently is required not just to maintain an environment conducive to learning, but to protect the very safety of students and school personnel. Such immediate action obviously would not be possible if a teacher were required to secure a warrant before searching a student. Nor would it be possible if a teacher could not conduct a necessary search until the teacher thought there was probable cause for the search. A teacher has neither the training nor the day-to-day experience in the complexities of probable cause that a law enforcement officer possesses, and is ill-equipped to make a quick judgment about the existence of probable cause. The time required for a teacher to ask the questions or make the observations that are necessary to turn reasonable grounds into probable cause is time during which the teacher, and other students, are diverted from the essential task of education. A teacher's focus is, and should be, on teaching and helping students, rather than on developing evidence against a particular troublemaker. Education \"is perhaps the most important function\" of government, Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 , 347 U. S. 493 (1954), and government has a heightened obligation to safeguard students whom it compels to attend school. The special need for an immediate response to behavior that threatens either the safety of schoolchildren and teachers or the educational process itself justifies the Court in excepting school searches from the warrant and probable cause requirement, and in applying a standard determined by balancing the relevant interests. I agree with the standard the Court has announced, and with its application of the standard to the facts of this case. I therefore concur in its judgment. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I fully agree with Part 469 U. S. Teachers, like all other government officials, must conform their conduct to the Fourth Amendment's protections of personal privacy and personal security. As JUSTICE STEVENS points out, post at 469 U. S. 373 -374, 469 U. S. 385 -386, this principle is of particular importance when applied to schoolteachers, for children learn as much by example as by exposition. It would be incongruous and futile to charge teachers with the task of embuing their students with an understanding of our system of constitutional democracy, while at the same time immunizing those same teachers from the need to respect constitutional protections. See Board of Education v. Pico, 457 U. S. 853 , 457 U. S. 864 -865 (1982) (plurality opinion); West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624 , 319 U. S. 637 (1943). I do not, however, otherwise join the Court's opinion. Today's decision sanctions school officials to conduct fullscale searches on a \"reasonableness\" standard whose only definite content is that it is not the same test as the \"probable cause\" standard found in the text of the Fourth Amendment. In adopting this unclear, unprecedented, and unnecessary departure from generally applicable Fourth Amendment standards, the Court carves out a broad exception to standards that this Court has developed over years of considering Fourth Amendment problems. Its decision is supported neither by precedent nor even by a fair application of the \"balancing test\" it proclaims in this very opinion. I Three basic principles underly this Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. First, warrantless searches are per se unreasonable, subject only to a few specifically delineated and well-recognized exceptions. See, e.g., Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 , 389 U. S. 357 (1967); accord, Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740 , 466 U. S. 748 -749 (1984); United States v. Place, 462 U. S. 696 , 462 U. S. 701 (1983); Steagald v. United States, 451 U. S. 204 , 451 U. S. 211 -212 (1981); Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385 (1978); Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 , 392 U. S. 20 (1968); Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10 , 333 U. S. 13 -14 (1948). Second, full-scale searches -- whether conducted in accordance with the warrant requirement or pursuant to one of its exceptions -- are \"reasonable\" in Fourth Amendment terms only on a showing of probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that evidence of the crime will be found in the place to be searched. Beck v. Ohio, 379 U. S. 89 , 379 U. S. 91 (1964); Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U. S. 471 , 371 U. S. 479 (1963); Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160 , 338 U. S. 175 -176 (1949). Third, categories of intrusions that are substantially less intrusive than full-scale searches or seizures may be justifiable in accordance with a balancing test even absent a warrant or probable cause, provided that the balancing test used gives sufficient weight to the privacy interests that will be infringed. Dunaway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200 , 442 U. S. 210 (1979); Terry v. Ohio, supra. Assistant Vice Principal Choplick's thorough excavation of T.L.O.'s purse was undoubtedly a serious intrusion on her privacy. Unlike the searches in Terry v. Ohio, supra, or Adams v. Williams, 407 U. S. 143 (1972), the search at issue here encompassed a detailed and minute examination of respondent's pocketbook, in which the contents of private papers and letters were thoroughly scrutinized. [ Footnote 3/1 ] Wisely, neither petitioner nor the Court today attempts to justify the search of T.L.O.'s pocketbook as a minimally intrusive search in the Terry line. To be faithful to the Court's settled doctrine, the inquiry therefore must focus on the warrant and probable cause requirements. A I agree that schoolteachers or principals, when not acting as agents of law enforcement authorities, generally may conduct a search of their students' belongings without first obtaining a warrant. To agree with the Court on this point is to say that school searches may justifiably be held to that extent to constitute an exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement. Such an exception, however, is not to be justified, as the Court apparently holds, by assessing net social value through application of an unguided \"balancing test\" in which \"the individual's legitimate expectations of privacy and personal security\" are weighed against \"the government's need for effective methods to deal with breaches of public order.\" Ante at 469 U. S. 337 . The Warrant Clause is something more than an exhortation to this Court to maximize social welfare as we see fit. It requires that the authorities must obtain a warrant before conducting a full-scale search. The undifferentiated governmental interest in law enforcement is insufficient to justify an exception to the warrant requirement. Rather, some special governmental interest beyond the need merely to apprehend lawbreakers is necessary to justify a categorical exception to the warrant requirement. For the most part, special governmental needs sufficient to override the warrant requirement flow from \"exigency\" -- that is, from the press of time that makes obtaining a warrant either impossible or hopelessly infeasible. See United States v. Place, supra, at 462 U. S. 701 -702; Mincey v. Arizona, supra, at 437 U. S. 393 -394; Johnson v. United States, supra, at 333 U. S. 15 . Only after finding an extraordinary governmental interest of this kind do we -- or ought we -- engage in a balancing test to determine if a warrant should nonetheless be required. [ Footnote 3/2 ] To require a showing of some extraordinary governmental interest before dispensing with the warrant requirement is not to undervalue society's need to apprehend violators of the criminal law. To be sure, forcing law enforcement personnel to obtain a warrant before engaging in a search will predictably deter the police from conducting some searches that they would otherwise like to conduct. But this is not an unintended result of the Fourth Amendment's protection of privacy; rather, it is the very purpose for which the Amendment was thought necessary. Only where the governmental interests at stake exceed those implicated in any ordinary law enforcement context -- that is, only where there is some extraordinary governmental interest involved -- is it legitimate to engage in a balancing test to determine whether a warrant is indeed necessary. In this case, such extraordinary governmental interests do exist and are sufficient to justify an exception to the warrant requirement. Students are necessarily confined for most of the schoolday in close proximity to each other and to the school staff. I agree with the Court that we can take judicial notice of the serious problems of drugs and violence that plague our schools. As JUSTICE BLACKMUN notes, teachers must not merely \"maintain an environment conducive to learning\" among children who \"are inclined to test the outer boundaries of acceptable conduct,\" but must also \"protect the very safety of students and school personnel.\" Ante at 469 U. S. 352 -353. A teacher or principal could neither carry out essential teaching functions nor adequately protect students' safety if required to wait for a warrant before conducting a necessary search. B I emphatically disagree with the Court's decision to cast aside the constitutional probable cause standard when assessing the constitutional validity of a schoolhouse search. The Court's decision jettisons the probable cause standard -- the only standard that finds support in the text of the Fourth Amendment -- on the basis of its Rohrschach-1ike \"balancing test.\" Use of such a \"balancing test\" to determine the standard for evaluating the validity of a full-scale search represents a sizable innovation in Fourth Amendment analysis. This innovation finds support neither in precedent nor policy and portends a dangerous weakening of the purpose of the Fourth Amendment to protect the privacy and security of our citizens. Moreover, even if this Court's historic understanding of the Fourth Amendment were mistaken and a balancing test of some kind were appropriate, any such test that gave adequate weight to the privacy and security interests protected by the Fourth Amendment would not reach the preordained result the Court's conclusory analysis reaches today. Therefore, because I believe that the balancing test used by the Court today is flawed both in its inception and in its execution, I respectfully dissent. 1 An unbroken line of cases in this Court have held that probable cause is a prerequisite for a full-scale search. In Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132 , 267 U. S. 149 (1925), the Court held that \"[o]n reason and authority the true rule is that, if the search and seizure . . . are made upon probable cause . . . the search and seizure are valid.\" Under our past decisions probable cause -- which exists where \"the facts and circumstances within [the officials'] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief\" that a criminal offense had occurred and the evidence would be found in the suspected place, id. at 267 U. S. 162 -- is the constitutional minimum for justifying a full-scale search, regardless of whether it is conducted pursuant to a warrant or, as in Carroll, within one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement. Henry v. United States, 361 U. S. 98 , 361 U. S. 104 (1959) ( Caroll \"merely relaxed the requirements for a warrant on grounds of practicality,\" but \"did not dispense with the need for probable cause\"); accord, Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42 , 399 U. S. 51 (1970) (\"In enforcing the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures, the Court has insisted upon probable cause as a minimum requirement for a reasonable search permitted by the Constitution\"). [ Footnote 3/3 ] Our holdings that probable cause is a prerequisite to a fullscale search are based on the relationship between the two Clauses of the Fourth Amendment. The first Clause (\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated . . .\") states the purpose of the Amendment and its coverage. The second Clause (\". . . and no Warrants shall issue but upon probable cause . . .\") gives content to the word \"unreasonable\" in the first Clause. \"For all but . . . narrowly defined intrusions, the requisite 'balancing' has been performed in centuries of precedent and is embodied in the principle that seizures are 'reasonable' only if supported by probable cause.\" Dunaway v. New York, 442 U.S. at 442 U. S. 214 . I therefore fully agree with the Court that \"the underlying command of the Fourth Amendment is always that searches and seizures be reasonable.\" Ante at 469 U. S. 337 . But this \"underlying command\" is not directly interpreted in each category of cases by some amorphous \"balancing test.\" Rather, the provisions of the Warrant Clause -- a warrant and probable cause -- provide the yardstick against which official searches and seizures are to be measured. The Fourth Amendment neither requires nor authorizes the conceptual free-for-all that ensues when an unguided balancing test is used to assess specific categories of searches. If the search in question is more than a minimally intrusive Terry stop, the constitutional probable cause standard determines its validity. To be sure, the Court recognizes that probable cause \"ordinarily\" is required to justify a full-scale search and that the existence of probable cause \"bears on\" the validity of the search. Ante at 469 U. S. 340 -341. Yet the Court fails to cite any case in which a full-scale intrusion upon privacy interests has been justified on less than probable cause. The line of cases begun by Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968), provides no support, for they applied a balancing test only in the context of minimally intrusive searches that served crucial law enforcement interests. The search in Terry itself, for instance, was a \"limited search of the outer clothing.\" Id. at 392 U. S. 30 . The type of border stop at issue in United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U. S. 873 , 422 U. S. 880 (1975), usually \"consume[d] no more than a minute\"; the Court explicitly noted that \"any further detention . . . must be based on consent or probable cause.\" Id. at 422 U. S. 882 . See also United States v. Hensley, ante at 469 U. S. 224 (momentary stop); United States v. Place, 462 U.S. at 462 U. S. 706 -707 (brief detention of luggage for canine \"sniff\"); Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U. S. 106 (1977) (per curiam) (brief frisk after stop for traffic violation); United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543 , 428 U. S. 560 (1976) (characterizing intrusion as \"minimal\"); Adams v. Williams, 407 U. S. 143 (1972) (stop and frisk). In short, all of these cases involved \"'seizures' so substantially less intrusive than arrests that the general rule requiring probable cause to make Fourth Amendment 'seizures' reasonable could be replaced by a balancing test.\" Nor do the \"administrative search\" cases provide any comfort for the Court. In Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U. S. 523 (1967), the Court held that the probable cause standard governed even administrative searches. Although the Camara Court recognized that probable cause standards themselves may have to be somewhat modified to take into account the special nature of administrative searches, the Court did so only after noting that \"because [housing code] inspections are neither personal in nature nor aimed at the discovery of evidence of crime, they involve a relatively limited invasion of the urban citizen's privacy.\" Id. at 387 U. S. 537 . Subsequent administrative search cases have similarly recognized that such searches intrude upon areas whose owners harbor a significantly decreased expectation of privacy, see, e.g., Donovan v. Dewey, 452 U. S. 594 , 452 U. S. 598 -599 (1981), thus circumscribing the injury to Fourth Amendment interests caused by the search. Considerations of the deepest significance for the freedom of our citizens counsel strict adherence to the principle that no search may be conducted where the official is not in possession of probable cause that is, where the official does not know of \"facts and circumstances [that] warrant a prudent man in believing that the offense has been committed.\" Henry v. United States, 361 U.S. at 361 U. S. 102 ; see also id. at 361 U. S. 100 -101 (discussing history of probable cause standard). The Fourth Amendment was designed not merely to protect against official intrusions whose social utility was less as measured by some \"balancing test\" than its intrusion on individual privacy; it was designed in addition to grant the individual a zone of privacy whose protections could be breached only where the \"reasonable\" requirements of the probable cause standard were met. Moved by whatever momentary evil has aroused their fears, officials -- perhaps even supported by a majority of citizens -- may be tempted to conduct searches that sacrifice the liberty of each citizen to assuage the perceived evil. [ Footnote 3/4 ] But the Fourth Amendment rests on the principle that a true balance between the individual and society depends on the recognition of \"the right to be let alone the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men.\" Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 , 277 U. S. 478 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). That right protects the privacy and security of the individual unless the authorities can cross a specific threshold of need, designated by the term \"probable cause.\" I cannot agree with the Court's assertions today that a \"balancing test\" can replace the constitutional threshold with one that is more convenient for those enforcing the laws but less protective of the citizens' liberty; the Fourth Amendment's protections should not be defaced by \"a balancing process that overwhelms the individual's protection against unwarranted official intrusion by a governmental interest said to justify the search and seizure.\" United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, supra, at 428 U. S. 570 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). 2 I thus do not accept the majority's premise that \"[t]o hold that the Fourth Amendment applies to searches conducted by school authorities is only to begin the inquiry into the standards governing such searches.\" Ante at 469 U. S. 337 . For me, the finding that the Fourth Amendment applies, coupled with the observation that what is at issue is a full-scale search, is the end of the inquiry. But even if I believed that a \"balancing test\" appropriately replaces the judgment of the Framers of the Fourth Amendment, I would nonetheless object to the cursory and shortsighted \"test\" that the Court employs to justify its predictable weakening of Fourth Amendment protections. In particular, the test employed by the Court vastly overstates the social costs that a probable cause standard entails and, though it plausibly articulates the serious privacy interests at stake, inexplicably fails to accord them adequate weight in striking the balance. The Court begins to articulate its \"balancing test\" by observing that \"the government's need for effective methods to deal with breaches of public order\" is to be weighed on one side of the balance. Ibid. Of course, this is not correct. It is not the government's need for effective enforcement methods that should weigh in the balance, for ordinary Fourth Amendment standards -- including probable cause.-- may well permit methods for maintaining the public order that are perfectly effective. If that were the case, the governmental interest in having effective standards would carry no weight at all as a justification for departing from the probable cause standard. Rather, it is the costs of applying probable cause as opposed to applying some lesser standard that should be weighed on the government's side. [ Footnote 3/5 ] In order to tote up the costs of applying the probable-cause standard, it is thus necessary first to take into account the nature and content of that standard, and the likelihood that it would hamper achievement of the goal -- vital not just to \"teachers and administrators,\" see ante at 469 U. S. 339 -- of maintaining an effective educational setting in the public schools. The seminal statement concerning the nature of the probable cause standard is found in Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132 (1925). Carroll held that law enforcement authorities have probable cause to search where \"the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief\" that a criminal offense had occurred. Id. at 267 U. S. 162 . In Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160 (1949), the Court amplified this requirement, holding that probable cause depends upon \"the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\" Id. at 338 U. S. 175 . Two Terms ago, in Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213 (1983), this Court expounded at some length its view of the probable cause standard. Among the adjectives used to describe the standard were \"practical,\" \"fluid,\" \"flexible,\" \"easily applied,\" and \"nontechnical.\" See id. at 462 U. S. 232 , 462 U. S. 236 , 462 U. S. 239 . The probable cause standard was to be seen as a \"common-sense\" test whose application depended on an evaluation of the \"totality of the circumstances.\" Id. at 462 U. S. 238 . Ignoring what Gates took such great pains to emphasize, the Court today holds that a new \"reasonableness\" standard is appropriate because it \"will spare teachers and school administrators the necessity of schooling themselves in the niceties of probable cause and permit them to regulate their conduct according to the dictates of reason and common sense.\" Ante at 469 U. S. 343 . I had never thought that our pre- Gates understanding of probable cause defied either reason or common sense. But after Gates, I would have thought that there could be no doubt that this \"nontechnical,\" \"practical,\" and \"easily applied\" concept was eminently serviceable in a context like a school, where teachers require the flexibility to respond quickly and decisively to emergencies. A consideration of the likely operation of the probable cause standard reinforces this conclusion. Discussing the issue of school searches, Professor LaFave has noted that the cases that have reached the appellate courts \"strongly suggest that in most instances the evidence of wrong-doing prompting teachers or principals to conduct searches is sufficiently detailed and specific to meet the traditional probable cause test.\" 3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 10.11, pp. 459-460 (1978). [ Footnote 3/6 ] The problems that have caused this Court difficulty in interpreting the probable cause standard have largely involved informants, see, e.g., Illinois v. Gates, supra; Spinelli v. United States, 393 U. S. 410 (1969); Agilar v. Texas, 378 U. S. 108 (1964); Draper v. United States, 358 U. S. 307 (1959). However, three factors make it likely that problems involving informants will not make it difficult for teachers and school administrators to make probable cause decisions. This Court's decision in Gates applying a \"totality of the circumstances\" test to determine whether an informant's tip can constitute probable cause renders the test easy for teachers to apply. The fact that students and teachers interact daily in the school building makes it more likely that teachers will get to know students who supply information; the problem of informants who remain anonymous even to the teachers -- and who are therefore unavailable for verification or further questioning -- is unlikely to arise. Finally, teachers can observe the behavior of students under suspicion to corroborate any doubtful tips they do receive. As compared with the relative ease with which teachers can apply the probable cause standard, the amorphous \"reasonableness under all the circumstances\" standard freshly coined by the Court today will likely spawn increased litigation and greater uncertainty among teachers and administrators. Of course, as this Court should know, an essential purpose of developing and articulating legal norms is to enable individuals to conform their conduct to those norms. A school system conscientiously attempting to obey the Fourth Amendment's dictates under a probable cause standard could, for example, consult decisions and other legal materials and prepare a booklet expounding the rough outlines of the concept. Such a booklet could be distributed to teachers to provide them with guidance as to when a search may be lawfully conducted. I cannot but believe that the same school system faced with interpreting what is permitted under the Court's new \"reasonableness\" standard would be hopelessly adrift as to when a search may be permissible. The sad result of this uncertainty may well be that some teachers will be reluctant to conduct searches that are fully permissible and even necessary under the constitutional probable cause standard, while others may intrude arbitrarily and unjustifiably on the privacy of students. [ Footnote 3/7 ] One further point should be taken into account when considering the desirability of replacing the constitutional probable cause standard. The question facing the Court is not whether the probable cause standard should be replaced by a test of \"reasonableness under all the circumstances.\" Rather, it is whether traditional Fourth Amendment standards should recede before the Court's new standard. Thus, although the Court today paints with a broad brush and holds its undefined \"reasonableness\" standard applicable to all school searches, I would approach the question with considerably more reserve. I would not think it necessary to develop a single standard to govern all school searches, any more than traditional Fourth Amendment law applies even the probable cause standard to all searches and seizures. For instance, just as police officers may conduct a brief stop and frisk on something less than probable cause, so too should teachers be permitted the same flexibility. A teacher or administrator who had reasonable suspicion that a student was carrying a gun would no doubt have authority under ordinary Fourth Amendment doctrine to conduct a limited search of the student to determine whether the threat was genuine. The \"costs\" of applying the traditional probable cause standard must therefore be discounted by the fact that, where additional flexibility is necessary and where the intrusion is minor, traditional Fourth Amendment jurisprudence itself displaces probable cause when it determines the validity of a search. A legitimate balancing test whose function was something more substantial than reaching a predetermined conclusion acceptable to this Court's impressions of what authority teachers need would therefore reach rather a different result than that reached by the Court today. On one side of the balance would be the costs of applying traditional Fourth Amendment standards -- the \"practical\" and \"flexible\" probable cause standard where a full-scale intrusion is sought, a lesser standard in situations where the intrusion is much less severe and the need for greater authority compelling. Whatever costs were toted up on this side would have to be discounted by the costs of applying an unprecedented and ill-defined \"reasonableness under all the circumstances\" test that will leave teachers and administrators uncertain as to their authority and will encourage excessive fact-based litigation. On the other side of the balance would be the serious privacy interests of the student, interests that the Court admirably articulates in its opinion, ante at 469 U. S. 337 -339, but which the Court's new ambiguous standard places in serious jeopardy. I have no doubt that a fair assessment of the two sides of the balance would necessarily reach the same conclusion that, as I have argued above, the Fourth Amendment's language compels -- that school searches like that conducted in this case are valid only if supported by probable cause. II Applying the constitutional probable cause standard to the facts of this case, I would find that Mr. Choplick's search violated T.L.O.'s Fourth Amendment rights. After escorting T.L.O. into his private office, Mr. Choplick demanded to see her purse. He then opened the purse to find evidence of whether she had been smoking in the bathroom. When he opened the purse, he discovered the pack of cigarettes. At this point, his search for evidence of the smoking violation was complete. Mr. Choplick then noticed, below the cigarettes, a pack of cigarette rolling papers. Believing that such papers were \"associated,\" see ante at 469 U. S. 328 , with the use of marihuana, he proceeded to conduct a detailed examination of the contents of her purse, in which he found some marihuana, a pipe, some money, an index card, and some private letters indicating that T.L.O. had sold marihuana to other students. The State sought to introduce this latter material in evidence at a criminal proceeding, and the issue before the Court is whether it should have been suppressed. On my view of the case, we need not decide whether the initial search conducted by Mr. Choplick -- the search for evidence of the smoking violation that was completed when Mr. Choplick found the pack of cigarettes -- was valid. For Mr. Choplick at that point did not have probable cause to continue to rummage through T.L.O.'s purse. Mr. Choplick's suspicion of marihuana possession at this time was based solely on the presence of the package of cigarette papers. The mere presence without more of such a staple item of commerce is insufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in inferring both that T.L.O. had violated the law by possessing marihuana and that evidence of that violation would be found in her purse. Just as a police officer could not obtain a warrant to search a home based solely on his claim that he had seen a package of cigarette papers in that home, Mr. Choplick was not entitled to search possibly the most private possessions of T.L.O. based on the mere presence of a package of cigarette papers. Therefore, the fruits of this illegal search must be excluded and the judgment of the New Jersey Supreme Court affirmed. III In the past several Terms, this Court has produced a succession of Fourth Amendment opinions in which \"balancing tests\" have been applied to resolve various questions concerning the proper scope of official searches. The Court has begun to apply a \"balancing test\" to determine whether a particular category of searches intrudes upon expectations of privacy that merit Fourth Amendment protection. See Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517 , 468 U. S. 527 (1984) (\"Determining whether an expectation of privacy is legitimate' or `reasonable' necessarily entails a balancing of interests\"). It applies a \"balancing test\" to determine whether a warrant is necessary to conduct a search. See ante at 469 U. S. 340 ; United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. at 428 U. S. 564 -566. In today's opinion, it employs a \"balancing test\" to determine what standard should govern the constitutionality of a given category of searches. See ante at 469 U. S. 340 -341. Should a search turn out to be unreasonable after application of all of these \"balancing tests,\" the Court then applies an additional \"balancing test\" to decide whether the evidence resulting from the search must be excluded. See United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897 (1984). All of these \"balancing tests\" amount to brief nods by the Court in the direction of a neutral utilitarian calculus while the Court in fact engages in an unanalyzed exercise of judicial will. Perhaps this doctrinally destructive nihilism is merely a convenient umbrella under which a majority that cannot agree on a genuine rationale can conceal its differences. Compare ante p. 469 U. S. 327 (WHITE, J., delivering the opinion of the Court), with ante p. 469 U. S. 348 (POWELL, J., joined by O'CONNOR, J., concurring), and ante p. 469 U. S. 351 (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in judgment). And it may be that the real force underlying today's decision is the belief that the Court purports to reject -- the belief that the unique role served by the schools justifies an exception to the Fourth Amendment on their behalf. If so, the methodology of today's decision may turn out to have as little influence in future cases as will its result, and the Court's departure from traditional Fourth Amendment doctrine will be confined to the schools. On my view, the presence of the word \"unreasonable\" in the text of the Fourth Amendment does not grant a shifting majority of this Court the authority to answer all Fourth Amendment questions by consulting its momentary vision of the social good. Full-scale searches unaccompanied by probable cause violate the Fourth Amendment. I do not pretend that our traditional Fourth Amendment doctrine automatically answers all of the difficult legal questions that occasionally arise. I do contend, however, that this Court has an obligation to provide some coherent framework to resolve such questions on the basis of more than a conclusory recitation of the results of a \"balancing test.\" The Fourth Amendment itself supplies that framework and, because the Court today fails to heed its message, I must respectfully dissent. A purse typically contains items of highly personal nature. Especially for shy or sensitive adolescents, it could prove extremely embarrassing for a teacher or principal to rummage through its contents, which could include notes from friends, fragments of love poems, caricatures of school authorities, and items of personal hygiene. Administrative search cases involving inspection schemes have recognized that \"if inspection is to be effective and serve as a credible deterrent, unannounced, even frequent, inspections are essential. In this context, the prerequisite of a warrant could easily frustrate inspection. . . .\" In fact, despite the somewhat diminished expectation of privacy that this Court has recognized in the automobile context, see South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U. S. 364 , 428 U. S. 367 -368 (1976), we have required probable cause even to justify a warrantless automobile search, see United States v. Ortiz, 422 U. S. 891 , 422 U. S. 896 (1975) (\"A search, even of an automobile, is a substantial invasion of privacy. To protect that privacy from official arbitrariness, the Court always has regarded probable cause as the minimum requirement for a lawful search\") (footnote omitted); Chamers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. at 399 U. S. 51 . As Justice Stewart said in Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443 , 403 U. S. 455 (1971): \"In times of unrest, whether caused by crime or racial conflict or fear of internal subversion this basic law and the values that it represents may appear unrealistic or 'extravagant' to some. But the values were those of the authors of our fundamental constitutional concepts.\" I speak of the \"government's side\" only because it is the terminology used by the Court. In my view, this terminology itself is seriously misleading. The government is charged with protecting the privacy and security of the citizen, just as it is charged with apprehending those who violate the criminal law. Consequently, the government has no legitimate interest in conducting a search that unduly intrudes on the privacy and security of the citizen. The balance is not between the rights of the government and the rights of the citizen, but between opposing conceptions of the constitutionally legitimate means of carrying out the government's varied responsibilities. It should be noted that Professor LaFave reached this conclusion in 1978, before this Court's decision in Gates made clear the \"flexibility\" of the probable cause concept. A comparison of the language of the standard (\"reasonableness under all the circumstances\") with the traditional language of probable cause (\"facts sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in believing that a crime had been committed and the evidence would be found in the designated place\") suggests that the Court's new standard may turn out to be probable cause under a new guise. If so, the additional uncertainty caused by this Court's innovation is surely unjustifiable; it would be naive to expect that the addition of this extra dose of uncertainty would do anything other than \"burden the efforts of school authorities to maintain order in their schools,\" ante at 469 U. S. 342 . If, on the other hand, the new standard permits searches of students in instances when probable cause is absent -- instances, according to this Court's consistent formulations, when a person of reasonable caution would not think it likely that a violation existed or that evidence of that violation would be found -- the new standard is genuinely objectionable and impossible to square with the premise that our citizens have the right to be free from arbitrary intrusions on their privacy. JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL joins, and with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN joins as to Part I, concurring in part and dissenting in part. Assistant Vice Principal Choplick searched T.L.O.'s purse for evidence that she was smoking in the girls' restroom. Because T.L.O.'s suspected misconduct was not illegal and did not pose a serious threat to school discipline, the New Jersey Supreme Court held that Choplick's search of her purse was an unreasonable invasion of her privacy and that the evidence which he seized could not be used against her in criminal proceedings. The New Jersey court's holding was a careful response to the case it was required to decide. The State of New Jersey sought review in this Court, first arguing that the exclusionary rule is wholly inapplicable to searches conducted by school officials, and then contending that the Fourth Amendment itself provides no protection at all to the student's privacy. The Court has accepted neither of these frontal assaults on the Fourth Amendment. It has, however, seized upon this \"no smoking\" case to announce \"the proper standard\" that should govern searches by school officials who are confronted with disciplinary problems far more severe than smoking in the restroom. Although I join Part 469 U. S. I continue to believe that the Court has unnecessarily and inappropriately reached out to decide a constitutional question. See 468 U. S. 1214 (1984) (STEVENS, J., dissenting from reargument order). More importantly, I fear that the concerns that motivated the Court's activism have produced a holding that will permit school administrators to search students suspected of violating only the most trivial school regulations and guidelines for behavior. I The question the Court decides today -- whether Mr. Choplick's search of T.L.O.'s purse violated the Fourth Amendment -- was not raised by the State's petition for writ of certiorari. That petition only raised one question: \"Whether the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary rule applies to searches made by public school officials and teachers in school.\" [ Footnote 4/1 ] The State quite properly declined to submit the former question because \"[it] did not wish to present what might appear to be solely a factual dispute to this Court.\" [ Footnote 4/2 ] Since this Court has twice had the threshold question argued, I believe that it should expressly consider the merits of the New Jersey Supreme Court's ruling that the exclusionary rule applies. The New Jersey Supreme Court's holding on this question is plainly correct. As the state court noted, this case does not involve the use of evidence in a school disciplinary proceeding; the juvenile proceedings brought against T.L.O. involved a charge that would have been a criminal offense if committed by an adult. [ Footnote 4/3 ] Accordingly, the exclusionary rule issue decided by that court and later presented to this Court concerned only the use in a criminal proceeding of evidence obtained in a search conducted by a public school administrator. Having confined the issue to the law enforcement context, the New Jersey court then reasoned that this Court's cases have made it quite clear that the exclusionary rule is equally applicable \"whether the public official who illegally obtained the evidence was a municipal inspector, See v. Seattle, 387 U. S. 541 [1967]; Camara [v. Municipal Court,] 387 U. S. 523 [1967]; a firefighter, Michigan v. Tyler, 436 U. S. 499 , 436 U. S. 506 [1978]; or a school administrator or law enforcement official. [ Footnote 4/4 ]\" It correctly concluded \"that, if an official search violates constitutional rights, the evidence is not admissible in criminal proceedings.\" [ Footnote 4/5 ] When a defendant in a criminal proceeding alleges that she was the victim of an illegal search by a school administrator, the application of the exclusionary rule is a simple corollary of the principle that \"all evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is, by that same authority, inadmissible in a state court.\" Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 , 367 U. S. 655 (1961). The practical basis for this principle is, in part, its deterrent effect, see id. at 367 U. S. 656 , and as a general matter it is tolerably clear to me, as it has been to the Court, that the existence of an exclusionary remedy does deter the authorities from violating the Fourth Amendment by sharply reducing their incentive to do so. [ Footnote 4/6 ] In the case of evidence obtained in school searches, the \"overall educative effect\" [ Footnote 4/7 ] of the exclusionary rule adds important symbolic force to this utilitarian judgment. Justice Brandeis was both a great student and a great teacher. It was he who wrote: \"Our Government is the potent, the onmipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example. Crime is contagious. If the Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy.\" Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 , 277 U. S. 485 (1928) (dissenting opinion). Those of us who revere the flag and the ideals for which it stands believe in the power of symbols. We cannot ignore that rules of law also have a symbolic power that may vastly exceed their utility. Schools are places where we inculcate the values essential to the meaningful exercise of rights and responsibilities by a self-governing citizenry. [ Footnote 4/8 ] If the Nation's students can be convicted through the use of arbitrary methods destructive of personal liberty, they cannot help but feel that they have been dealt with unfairly. [ Footnote 4/9 ] The application of the exclusionary rule in criminal proceedings arising from illegal school searches makes an important statement to young people that \"our society attaches serious consequences to a violation of constitutional rights,\" [ Footnote 4/10 ] and that this is a principle of \"liberty and justice for all.\" [ Footnote 4/11 ] Thus, the simple and correct answer to the question presented by the State's petition for certiorari would have required affirmance of a state court's judgment suppressing evidence. That result would have been dramatically out of character for a Court that not only grants prosecutors relief from suppression orders with distressing regularity, [ Footnote 4/12 ] but also is prone to rely on grounds not advanced by the parties in order to protect evidence from exclusion. [ Footnote 4/13 ] In characteristic disregard of the doctrine of judicial restraint, the Court avoided that result in this case by ordering reargument and directing the parties to address a constitutional question that the parties, with good reason, had not asked the Court to decide. Because judicial activism undermines the Court's power to perform its central mission in a legitimate way, I dissented from the reargument order. See 468 U. S. 1214 (1984). I have not modified the views expressed in that dissent, but since the majority has brought the question before us, I shall explain why I believe the Court has misapplied the standard of reasonableness embodied in the Fourth Amendment. II The search of a young woman's purse by a school administrator is a serious invasion of her legitimate expectations of privacy. A purse \"is a common repository for one's personal effects and therefore is inevitably associated with the expectation of privacy.\" Arkansas v. Sanders, 442 U. S. 753 , 442 U. S. 762 (1979). Although such expectations must sometimes yield to the legitimate requirements of government, in assessing the constitutionality of a warrantless search, our decision must be guided by the language of the Fourth Amendment: \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated. . . . \" In order to evaluate the reasonableness of such searches, \"it is necessary 'first to focus upon the governmental interest which allegedly justifies official intrusion upon the constitutionally protected interests of the private citizen,' for there is 'no ready test for determining reasonableness other than by balancing the need to search [or seize] against the invasion which the search [or seizure] entails.'\" The \"limited search for weapons\" in Terry was justified by the \"immediate interest of the police officer in taking steps to assure himself that the person with whom he is dealing is not armed with a weapon that could unexpectedly and fatally be used against him.\" 392 U.S. at 392 U. S. 23 , 392 U. S. 25 . When viewed from the institutional perspective, \"the substantial need of teachers and administrators for freedom to maintain order in the schools,\" ante at 469 U. S. 341 (majority opinion), is no less acute. Violent, unlawful, or seriously disruptive conduct is fundamentally inconsistent with the principal function of teaching institutions which is to educate young people and prepare them for citizenship. [ Footnote 4/15 ] When such conduct occurs amidst a sizable group of impressionable young people, it creates an explosive atmosphere that requires a prompt and effective response. Thus, warrantless searches of students by school administrators are reasonable when undertaken for those purposes. But the majority's statement of the standard for evaluating the reasonableness of such searches is not suitably adapted to that end. The majority holds that \"a search of a student by a teacher or other school official will be 'justified at its inception' when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school. \" Ante at 469 U. S. 341 -342. This standard will permit teachers and school administrators to search students when they suspect that the search will reveal evidence of even the most trivial school regulation or precatory guideline for student behavior. The Court's standard for deciding whether a search is justified \"at its inception\" treats all violations of the rules of the school as though they were fungible. For the Court, a search for curlers and sunglasses in order to enforce the school dress code [ Footnote 4/16 ] is apparently just as important as a search for evidence of heroin addiction or violent gang activity. The majority, however, does not contend that school administrators have a compelling need to search students in order to achieve optimum enforcement of minor school regulations. [ Footnote 4/17 ] To the contrary, when minor violations are involved, there is every indication that the informal school disciplinary process, with only minimum requirements of due process, [ Footnote 4/18 ] can function effectively without the power to search for enough evidence to prove a criminal case. In arguing that teachers and school administrators need the power to search students based on a lessened standard, the United States as amicus curiae relies heavily on empirical evidence of a contemporary crisis of violence and unlawful behavior that is seriously undermining the process of education in American schools. [ Footnote 4/19 ] A standard better attuned to this concern would permit teachers and school administrators to search a student when they have reason to believe that the search will uncover evidence that the student is violating the law or engaging in conduct that is seriously disruptive of school order, or the educational process. This standard is properly directed at \"[t]he sole justification for the [warrantless] search.\" [ Footnote 4/20 ] In addition, a standard that varies the extent of the permissible intrusion with the gravity of the suspected offense is also more consistent with common law experience and this Court's precedent. Criminal law has traditionally recognized a distinction between essentially regulatory offenses and serious violations of the peace, and graduated the response of the criminal justice system depending on the character of the violation. [ Footnote 4/21 ] The application of a similar distinction in evaluating the reasonableness of warrantless searches and seizures \"is not a novel idea.\" Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740 , 466 U. S. 750 (1984). [ Footnote 4/22 ] In Welsh, police officers arrived at the scene of a traffic accident and obtained information indicating that the driver of the automobile involved was guilty of a first offense of driving while intoxicated -- a civil violation with a maximum fine of $200. The driver had left the scene of the accident, and the officers followed the suspect to his home where they arrested him without a warrant. Absent exigent circumstances, the warrantless invasion of the home was a clear violation of Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573 (1980). In holding that the warrantless arrest for the \"noncriminal, traffic offense\" in Welsh was unconstitutional, the Court noted that \"application of the exigent-circumstances exception in the context of a home entry should rarely be sanctioned when there is probable cause to believe that only a minor offense . . . has been committed.\" 466 U.S. at 466 U. S. 753 . The logic of distinguishing between minor and serious offenses in evaluating the reasonableness of school searches is almost too clear for argument. In order to justify the serious intrusion on the persons and privacy of young people that New Jersey asks this Court to approve, the State must identify \"some real immediate and serious consequences.\" McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451 , 335 U. S. 460 (1948) (Jackson, J., concurring, joined by Frankfurter, J.). [ Footnote 4/23 ] While school administrators have entirely legitimate reasons for adopting school regulations and guidelines for student behavior, the authorization of searches to enforce them \"displays a shocking lack of all sense of proportion.\" Id. 335 U. S. 459 . [ Footnote 4/24 ] The majority offers weak deference to these principles of balance and decency by announcing that school searches will only be reasonable in scope \"when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction. \" Ante at 469 U. S. 342 (emphasis added). The majority offers no explanation why a two-part standard is necessary to evaluate the reasonableness of the ordinary school search. Significantly, in the balance of its opinion the Court pretermits any discussion of the nature of T.L.O.'s infraction of the \"no smoking\" rule. The \"rider\" to the Court's standard for evaluating the reasonableness of the initial intrusion apparently is the Court's perception that its standard is overly generous and does not, by itself, achieve a fair balance between the administrator's right to search and the student's reasonable expectations of privacy. The Court's standard for evaluating the \"scope\" of reasonable school searches is obviously designed to prohibit physically intrusive searches of students by persons of the opposite sex for relatively minor offenses. The Court's effort to establish a standard that is, at once, clear enough to allow searches to be upheld in nearly every case, and flexible enough to prohibit obviously unreasonable intrusions of young adults' privacy only creates uncertainty in the extent of its resolve to prohibit the latter. Moreover, the majority's application of its standard in this case -- to permit a male administrator to rummage through the purse of a female high school student in order to obtain evidence that she was smoking in a bathroom -- raises grave doubts in my mind whether its effort will be effective. [ Footnote 4/25 ] Unlike the Court, I believe the nature of the suspected infraction is a matter of first importance in deciding whether any invasion of privacy is permissible. III The Court embraces the standard applied by the New Jersey Supreme Court as equivalent to its own, and then deprecates the state court's application of the standard as reflecting \"a somewhat crabbed notion of reasonableness.\" Ante at 469 U. S. 343 . There is no mystery, however, in the state court's finding that the search in this case was unconstitutional; the decision below was not based on a manipulation of reasonable suspicion, but on the trivial character of the activity that promoted the official search. The New Jersey Supreme Court wrote: \"We are satisfied that, when a school official has reasonable grounds to believe that a student possesses evidence of illegal activity or activity that would interfere with school discipline and order, the school official has the right to conduct a reasonable search for such evidence.\" \"In determining whether the school official has reasonable grounds, courts should consider the child's age, history, and school record, the prevalence and seriousness of the problem in the school to which the search was directed, the exigency to make the search without delay, and the probative value and reliability of the information used as a justification for the search. [ Footnote 4/26 ]\" The emphasized language in the state court's opinion focuses on the character of the rule infraction that is to be the object of the search. In the view of the state court, there is a quite obvious and material difference between a search for evidence relating to violent or disruptive activity, and a search for evidence of a smoking rule violation. This distinction does not imply that a no-smoking rule is a matter of minor importance. Rather, like a rule that prohibits a student from being tardy, its occasional violation in a context that poses no threat of disrupting school order and discipline offers no reason to believe that an immediate search is necessary to avoid unlawful conduct, violence, or a serious impairment of the educational process. A correct understanding of the New Jersey court's standard explains why that court concluded in T.L.O.'s case that \"the assistant principal did not have reasonable grounds to believe that the student was concealing in her purse evidence of criminal activity or evidence of activity that would seriously interfere with school discipline or order. [ Footnote 4/27 ]\" The importance of the nature of the rule infraction to the New Jersey Supreme Court's holding is evident from its brief explanation of the principal basis for its decision: \"A student has an expectation of privacy in the contents of her purse. Mere possession of cigarettes did not violate school rule or policy, since the school allowed smoking in designated areas. The contents of the handbag had no direct bearing on the infraction.\" \"The assistant principal's desire, legal in itself, to gather evidence to impeach the student's credibility at a hearing on the disciplinary infraction does not validate the search. [ Footnote 4/28 ]\" Like the New Jersey Supreme Court, I would view this case differently if the Assistant Vice Principal had reason to believe T.L.O.'s purse contained evidence of criminal activity, or of an activity that would seriously disrupt school discipline. There was, however, absolutely no basis for any such assumption -- not even a \"hunch.\" In this case, Mr. Choplick overreacted to what appeared to be nothing more than a minor infraction -- a rule prohibiting smoking in the bathroom of the freshmen's and sophomores' building. [ Footnote 4/29 ] It is, of course, true that he actually found evidence of serious wrongdoing by T.L.O., but no one claims that the prior search may be justified by his unexpected discovery. As far as the smoking infraction is concerned, the search for cigarettes merely tended to corroborate a teacher's eyewitness account of T.L.O.'s violation of a minor regulation designed to channel student smoking behavior into designated locations. Because this conduct was neither unlawful nor significantly disruptive of school order or the educational process, the invasion of privacy associated with the forcible opening of T.L.O.'s purse was entirely unjustified at its inception. A review of the sampling of school search cases relied on by the Court demonstrates how different this case is from those in which there was indeed a valid justification for intruding on a student's privacy. In most of them the student was suspected of a criminal violation; [ Footnote 4/30 ] in the remainder either violence or substantial disruption of school order or the integrity of the academic process was at stake. [ Footnote 4/31 ] Few involved matters as trivial as the no-smoking rule violated by T.L.0., [ Footnote 4/32 ] The rule the Court adopts today is so open-ended that it may make the Fourth Amendment virtually meaningless in the school context. Although I agree that school administrators must have broad latitude to maintain order and discipline in our classrooms, that authority is not unlimited. IV The schoolroom is the first opportunity most citizens have to experience the power of government. Through it passes every citizen and public official, from schoolteachers to policemen and prison guards. The values they learn there, they take with them in life. One of our most cherished ideals is the one contained in the Fourth Amendment: that the government may not intrude on the personal privacy of its citizens without a warrant or compelling circumstance. The Court's decision today is a curious moral for the Nation's youth. Although the search of T.L.O.'s purse does not trouble today's majority, I submit that we are not dealing with \"matters relatively trivial to the welfare of the Nation. There are village tyrants as well as village Hampdens, but none who acts under color of law is beyond reach of the Constitution.\" West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624 , 319 U. S. 638 (1943). I respectfully dissent. Pet. for Cert. i. Supplemental Brief for Petitioner 6. Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. at 428 U. S. 493 . See Board of Education v. Pico, 457 U.

A brief survey of school rule books reveals that, under the majority's approach, teachers and school administrators may also search students to enforce school rules regulating: \"(i) secret societies;\" \"(ii) students driving to school;\" \"(iii) parking and use of parking lots during school hours;\" \"(iv) smoking on campus;\" \"(v) the direction of traffic in the hallways;\" \"(vi) student presence in the hallways during class hours without a pass;\" \"(vii) profanity;\" \"(viii) school attendance of interscholastic athletes on the day of a game, meet or match;\" \"(ix) cafeteria use and cleanup;\" \"(x) eating lunch off-campus; and\" \"(xi) unauthorized absence.\" See id. at 7-18; Student Handbook of South Windsor [Conn.] H.

[I]f the probable cause standard . . . is adopted, . . . the reasonable goals of code enforcement will be dealt a crushing blow\"). \"The sad truth is that many classrooms across the country are not temples of learning teaching the lessons of good will, civility, and wisdom that are central to the fabric of American life. To the contrary, many schools are in such a state of disorder that not only is the educational atmosphere polluted, but the very safety of students and teachers is imperiled.\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23. See also Brief for National Education Association as Amicus Curiae 21 (\"If a suspected violation of a rule threatens to disrupt the school or threatens to harm students, school officials should be free to search for evidence of it\").

Throughout the criminal law this dichotomy has been expressed by classifying crimes as misdemeanors or felonies, malum prohibitum or malum in se, crimes that do not involve moral turpitude or those that do, and major or petty offenses. See generally W. LaFave, Handbook on Criminal Law \u00a7 6 (1972). Some codes of student behavior also provide a system of graduated response by distinguishing between violent, unlawful, or seriously disruptive conduct, and conduct that will only warrant serious sanctions when the student engages in repetitive offenses. See, e.g., Parent-Student Handbook of Piscataway [N.J.] H.S. (1979), Record Doc. S-1, pp. 15-16; Student Handbook of South Windsor [Conn.] H.S. \ufffd E (1984); Rules of the Board of Education of the District of Columbia, Ch. IV, \u00a7\u00a7 431.1-.10 (1982). Indeed, at Piscataway High School a violation of smoking regulations that is \"[a] student's first offense will result in assignment of up to three (3) days of after school classes concerning hazards of smoking.\" Record Doc. S-1, supra, at 15. In Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. at 419 U. S. 582 -583 (emphasis added), the Court noted that similar considerations require some variance in the requirements of due process in the school disciplinary context: \"[A]s a general rule notice and hearing should precede removal of the student from school. We agree . . ., however, that there are recurring situations in which prior notice and hearing cannot be insisted upon. Students whose presence poses a continuing danger to persons or property or an ongoing threat of disrupting the academic process may be immediately removed from school. In such cases the necessary notice and rudimentary hearing should follow as soon as practicable. . . .\" In McDonald police officers made a warrantless search of the office of an illegal \"numbers\" operation. Justice Jackson rejected the view that the search could be supported by exigent circumstances: \"Even if one were to conclude that urgent circumstances might justify a forced entry without a warrant, no such emergency was present in this case. . . . Whether there is reasonable necessity for a search without waiting to obtain a warrant certainly depends somewhat upon the gravity of the offense thought to be in progress as well as the hazards of the method of attempting to reach it. . . . [The defendant's] criminal operation, while a shabby swindle that the police are quite right in suppressing, was not one which endangered life or limb or the peace and good order of the community. . . .\" 335 U.S. at 335 U. S. 459 -460. While a policeman who sees a person smoking in an elevator in violation of a city ordinance may conduct a full-blown search for evidence of the smoking violation in the unlikely event of a custodial arrest, United States v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218 , 414 U. S. 236 (1973); Gustafson v. Florida, 414 U. S. 260 , 414 U. S. 265 -266 (1973), it is more doubtful whether a search of this kind would be reasonable if the officer only planned to issue a citation to the offender and depart, see Robinson, 414 U.S. at 414 U. S. 236 , n. 6. In any case, the majority offers no rationale supporting its conclusion that a student detained by school officials for questioning, on reasonable suspicion that she has violated a school rule, is entitled to no more protection under the Fourth Amendment than a criminal suspect under custodial arrest. One thing is clear under any standard -- the shocking strip searches that are described in some cases have no place in the schoolhouse. See Doe v. Renfrow, 631 F.2d 91, 92-93 (CA7 1980) (\"It does not require a constitutional scholar to conclude that a nude search of a 13-year-old child is an invasion of constitutional rights of some magnitude\"), cert. denied 451 U. S. 1022 (1981); Bellnier v. Lund, 438 F. Supp. 47 (NDNY 1977), People v. D., 34 N.Y.2d 483, 315 N.E.2d 466 (1974); M.J. v. State, 399 So. 2d 996 (Fla.App.1981). To the extent that deeply intrusive searches are ever reasonable outside the custodial context, it surely must only be to prevent imminent, and serious harm. 94 N.J. at 346, 463 A.2d at 941-942 ( quoting State v. McKinnon, 88 Wash. 2d 75 , 81, 558 P.2d 781 , 784 (1977)) (emphasis added). 94 N.J. at 347, 463 A.2d at 942 (emphasis added). Ibid. The court added: \"Moreover, there were not reasonable grounds to believe that the purse contained cigarettes, if they were the object of the search. No one had furnished information to that effect to the school official. He had, at best, a good hunch. No doubt good hunches would unearth much more evidence of crime on the persons of students and citizens as a whole. But more is required to sustain a search.\" Id. at 347, 463 A.2d at 942-943. It is this portion of the New Jersey Supreme Court's reasoning -- a portion that was not necessary to its holding -- to which this Court makes its principal response. See ante, at 469 U. S. 345 -346.

The initial report from the teacher that T.L.O. had been smoking in violation of school rules constituted reasonable suspicion that cigarettes were in her purse (a fact that would be relevant to the smoking accusation).\nSecond, the Court noted that the discovery of rolling paper provided reasonable suspicion that T.L.O. possessed marijuana, and this justified the further search of her purse. Since the school administrator\u2019s actions were justified at the inception and were reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the interference, the search was reasonable. Although the Court held that the Fourth Amendment applied to the school administrator\u2019s actions, the court ultimately determined that his actions in this case did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\nIn a concurrence, Justice Powell, joined by Justice O\u2019Connor, agreed with the majority\u2019s opinion, but he would have emphasized the fact that, in a school setting, the Constitution may not afford students all of the constitutional protections they would otherwise have in a non-school setting.\nIn a concurrence, Justice Blackmun agreed with the majority. However, he emphasized that the need for school authorities to immediately respond to threats to safety and to protect the education environment would justify a special exception from the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant and probable cause requirements for school searches.\nJustice Brennan, joined by Justice Marshall, concurred in part and dissented in part. Justice Brennan, joined by Justice Marshall, agreed with the Court\u2019s finding that the Fourth Amendment applies to public school teachers and that school officials may generally search students without a warrant. However, he disagreed with the Court\u2019s holding that reasonable suspicion as opposed to probable cause should be the test for determining whether such searches may be permitted. Applying the probable cause standard, Justice Brennan held that the school administrator\u2019s actions violated T.L.O.\u2019s rights and, thus, the evidence from the illegal search should be suppressed.\nJustice Stevens, in his concurrence in part and dissent in part, noted that the Court should address the original issue, i.e., whether the exclusionary rule applies to searches made by public school officials and teachers in school. Justice Stevens concluded that the search was not justified at its inception because the school administrator had no reason to believe that T.L.O.\u2019s purse contained evidence of criminal activity or a violation of school rules at the time that he searched it. Thus, the search violated the Fourth Amendment and the evidence should be suppressed.\nDisclaimer (Please Note): This activity is meant to help high school students understand, as part of their civics education, the key facts and holdings of a well-known U.S. Supreme Court case.

It in no way provides legal advice or guidance on this or other issues.\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\nThe provisions of the first Ten Amendments to the Constitution, i.e., the Bill of Rights (1791), originally were applicable only to the federal government, and not to state governments. In 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. It says, in relevant part, \u201c[N]or shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d In a series of cases starting in 1925, the U.S. Supreme Court interpreted the 14th Amendment as \u201cincorporating\u201d (applying) most but not all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights to the states.\nIncorporation of the Fourth Amendment\nIn several cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has incorporated various provisions of the Fourth Amendment, and related judicial rulings, to the states. For instance, in Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961), the Court held that the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures was applicable to States. Also applicable to the states was the exclusionary rule (a remedy by which evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment is inadmissible in court). As a result of these incorporations, the U.S. Supreme Court had the authority to decide whether the actions of the school administrator in T.L.O.\u2019s case violated the U.S. Constitution.\nImportance of State Constitutions\nEach state has its own Constitution, including some form of a state Bill of Rights, as well as laws. The states are free to interpret their Constitutions and laws in a manner that gives more protections to individuals than the U.S. Constitution. However, they cannot interpret them in a manner that gives less protection. The U.S. Supreme Court found that the school administrator\u2019s actions in T.L.O.\u2019s case did not violate the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution as applied to the states through the 14th Amendment.\nIt is possible that the New Jersey courts, applying the New Jersey Constitution and laws, could find that the school administrator\u2019s actions violated New Jersey\u2019s equivalent of the Fourth Amendment. In Footnote 10 of the majority opinion, Justice White makes this point, saying: \u201cOf course, New Jersey may insist on a more demanding standard under its own Constitution or statutes. In that case, this court would not purport to be applying the Fourth Amendment when they invalidate a search.\u201d\nDISCLAIMER: These resources are created by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts for educational purposes only.

T.L.O. (1985). T.L.O. was a 14-year-old female student at a New Jersey high school. A teacher found T.L.O. and another student smoking cigarettes in the girls\u2019 restroom in the school building in violation of school rules. The teacher brought the two students to a school administrator, who questioned each of them. The second student admitted to smoking cigarettes. T.L.O. denied the allegations. The administrator then accused T.LO. of lying to him, and demanded to see her purse in an attempt to find the cigarettes. Among other things, when the administrator opened her purse, he found a pack of cigarettes, and cigarette rolling paper. Due to the fact that the administrator knew that cigarette rolling paper is used to smoke marijuana he now suspected T.L.O. of marijuana use. He further searched T.L.O.\u2019s purse, and found a small plastic bag containing a grass-like substance and items that could be drug paraphernalia, including a pipe, a wad of money, a piece of paper with the names of students who apparently owed T.L.O. money, and a letter that appeared to implicate T.L.O. in dealing marijuana. The administrator contacted the police who, in turn, contacted T.L.O.\u2019s mother. Her mother brought T.L.O. to the police station, where she confessed to selling marijuana. Due to her age, T.L.O. faced delinquency charges in Juvenile Court. The Juvenile Court denied T.L.O.\u2019s motion to suppress (keep out) her confession and the evidence from the search. Her lawyer argued that the search of her purse was a violation of the Fourth Amendment. T.L.O. was found delinquent, and was put on probation for one year. After a lengthy appeal process in the New Jersey state court system, the U.S. Supreme Court of the United States agreed to hear the case. \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d Lower Court 1 : Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of Middlesex County, N.J. Lower Court 1 Ruling : The Fourth Amendment applies to searches carried out by school officials, but a school official may conduct a search of a student\u2019s person under certain circumstances. Specifically, the Juvenile Court held that a school official may search a student if the official has reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is in the process of being committed, or has reasonable cause to believe the search is necessary to maintain school discipline or enforce polices. Applying this standard to the facts of this case, the Court held that the Fourth Amendment was not violated by the school administrator\u2019s search. T.L.O. was found delinquent and sentenced to probation for one year. Lower Court 2 : Appellate Division (New Jersey State Court System) Lower Court 2 Ruling : Affirmed the Juvenile Court\u2019s decision that there was no Fourth Amendment violation, but vacated the delinquency adjudication and remanded (sent back) the case to the Juvenile Court decide if T.L.O. had knowingly and voluntarily waived her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination before confessing. Lower Court 3 : New Jersey State Supreme Court Lower Court 3 Ruling : Agreed with the lower courts that the Fourth Amendment is applicable to the conduct of school officials; also agreed that school officials may conduct a warrantless search of a student when they have reasonable grounds to believe that a student possesses evidence of illegal activity or activity that interferes with school discipline and order. However, New Jersey\u2019s highest court ultimately reversed, holding, in T.L.O.\u2019s case, the school administrator\u2019s conduct was not reasonable because the mere possession of cigarettes did not violate school rules. The administrator\u2019s desire to catch T.L.O. in a lie did not justify rummaging through her purse. Whether evidence unlawfully seized by a school official \u2013 without involvement of law enforcement officials \u2013 should be allowed in as evidence at juvenile delinquency proceedings. The Court did not reach this issue. As explained in the reasoning section below, the Court concluded that, under the circumstances of this case, the search of T.L.O.\u2019s purse did not violate the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Court did not address the issue of whether unlawfully seized evidence should be suppressed in a juvenile delinquency hearing. However, the Court decided that the Fourth Amendment applies to school officials. Supreme Court Vote: 6-3 Argued: March 28, 1984 Re-argued: October 2, 1984 Decided: January 15, 1985 Majority Opinion: Justice White Concurrences: Justice Powell, with Justice Day O\u2019Connor Justice Blackmun Concurrence in Part and Dissent in Part: Justice Brennan, with Justice Marshall Justice Stevens, with Justices Marshall and Brennan The Court held that the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures is not limited solely to the actions of law enforcement personnel. It also applies to the conduct of public school officials. Public school teachers act as agents of the state, and not merely agents of the students\u2019 parents. Thus, the Fourth Amendment applies to their actions. The Court also held that students have some legitimate expectation of privacy at school. However, the students\u2019 expectation of privacy must be balanced against the needs of school authorities to maintain an educational environment. As such, school authorities do not need to obtain a warrant or have probable cause that a crime occurred before searching a student. Rather, the reasonableness of a search, under all circumstances, will determine its legality. The Court established the following test to determine the reasonableness of a search: whether the search was 1) justified at its inception and 2) as the search was conducted, was it reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the interference in the first place. Finally, the Court evaluated the facts of T.L.O.\u2019s search in light of this test. First, the Court concluded that the search was justified at its inception.

Contrasting the past with the present is worthy of consideration as so many social mores and laws concerning marriage and divorce have evolved. This transformation of values, however, has not always been uneven. Divorce has been made legally easier to obtain. And yet in many social settings, the opinion remains that marriage that ends before death is a sign of failure. Because of this, a desire to avoid feelings of guilt, shame, embarrassment, fear, and dishonor in the eyes of family and friends function as strong inhibitors for effectuating divorce \u2013 even if your spouse has a pathological, narcissistic personality disorder .\nThis social dynamic has made some Seek Alternatives to \u2018til Death Do Us Part\u2019 . By knowing even a little about the history of marriage, it becomes apparent that this judgment rooted in nostalgia \u2013 i.e. \u201ca few decades ago marriage meant a real life-long commitment\u201d \u2013 is based on a misunderstanding of the generations that predate the present. The rise in life expectancy, the transformation of the church and state\u2019s role in marriage, and the transformation of values, attitudes, and beliefs towards marriage in the English-speaking world over the past five hundred years shows that \u2018until death do us part\u2019 is a far more complicated standard than it appears at face. By contrasting the life expectancy, marital norms, and social views on the purpose of marriage between the cultures which birthed the \u2018as long as you both shall live\u2019 standard and the present enables appraisal of this worldview and its value for the modern age. Doing so helps provide insights as to why the legal system has increasingly come to support people in romantic relationships who want the freedom to start fresh.\nFor centuries, marriage in the English-speaking world has been regarded as a contract that ended only when one partner was no longer alive. The phrase \u201cuntil death do us part\u201d was first popularized in the English-speaking world following the first printing of the Book of Common Prayer in England in 1549. In God Talk , published in New Yorker magazine, Harvard professor of literary criticism James Wood provides a history of the book\u2019s publication and traces its influence. He cites several well-known, high-brow British authors, David Bowie songs, and Neville Chamberlain\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cPeace for our time\u201d. Were the article updated today, Wood would likely include the Marvel Cinematic Universe in his list of traces. Ironman/Tony Stark and Ultron have both adopted \u201cPeace in our time\u201d as a motivating, quasi-religious maxim.\nThe passage from the vows which end in \u2018until death do us part\u2019 begins with a commitment to stay together \u201cfor better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health\u201d. The wording of this rite denoting permanent spiritual union is compelling poetry. And yet it\u2019s important to note that at the time that marriage was evolving into an institution, the human lifespan was almost half of what it is today.\nH.O. Lancaster was an Australian mathematical statistician affiliated with the University of Sydney that was awarded the Order of Australia for his work in math. Lancaster\u2019s study \u201c Expectations of Life \u201d offers an in-depth look at the life expectancy of English males before and after the period of the Book of Common Prayer was published. Lancaster collected a large body of data on the births and deaths of the aristocratic class, those most likely to be noted in such registers, from the years 1200 through 1745.\nBelow is a timeline of life expectancy by 50-year periods that depicts his findings:\n- 1200-1300: 43 years\n- 1300-1400: 24 years\n- 1400-1500: 48 years\n- 1500-1550: 50 years\n- 1550-1600: 47 years\n- 1600-1650: 43 years\n- 1650-1700: 41 years\n- 1700-1745: 43 years\nConsidering that the aristocratic class then, as now, was more likely to live longer , it\u2019s likely that the actual average life expectancy was several years lower than the ages listed here.\nFollowing the publication of research by Londoner and proto-epidemiologist John Snow, whose research on the cholera epidemi c had a tremendous impact on life in cities all over the world, along with the social advocacy of barrister Edwin Chadwick , the First Public Health Revolution began. The non-medical social improvements Snow and Chadwick helped initiate, such as public water treatment, food inspection, and waste management, would radically raise the average life expectancy rate. The later development of antibiotics like penicillin and advanced surgical techniques raised this number even more.\nWhat this means is that over the past 200 years the length a marriage was expected to last according to this view has more than doubled. If a couple married in 1600 when each was 24 and then died at 43, they\u2019d have been married for 19 years. That same couple today is statistically, according to the World Bank , likely to live until 81. This means is that this marriage would last for 57 years \u2013 which is 3 times as long as it was 400 years ago.\nWhat this means is that the midlife crisis that Brides author Cathy Meyer warns wives about and that PsychCentral and Healthline describe so that men can have information on how to be resilient in the face of distress was something that most of these women never faced. Similarly, the midlife crises which Cleveland Clinic describes women as going through were something that most men never dealt with. While supporting your partner in times of crisis is a core marital value \u2013 its extension across such a long period is novel. This is not the only aspect of marriage that has changed.\nIn addition to the rise of life expectancy that has impacted marital relations, the role of religious and state institutions has also evolved alongside a transformation of what marriage means. According to the author of Marriage, a History: How Love Conquered Marriage , Stephanie Coontz, in the article The World-Historical Transformation of Marriage : \u201cFor more than a thousand years, the Catholic church took the position that if a man and woman claimed that they had exchanged words of consent, whether in the kitchen or out by the haystack then they were married.\u201d (Coontz 974). Similarly, according to sociologist Dr. Carol Smart of the University of Manchester, it wasn\u2019t until 1793 and the passage of the Clandestine Marriage Act that state involvement in marriage was significant. This act, effectively, ended the protections granted by common law marriage .\nDr. Smart shared with the BBC that the act marked the beginning of state involvement by requiring couples to get married by a minister in a church or chapel otherwise the union would be considered invalid. Though by that time America had separated from England via political revolution, according to historic researches affiliated with PBS , many of the cultural values were still the same.\nThe United States went through a similar transformation. Common-Law was adopted by the Colonies, however, in the 1800s, various states began to repeal these rights. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures , only eight U.S. states recognize common law marriage: Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah.\nThe depiction of marriage shown in the above painting made is, in other words, relatively modern. Somber and public religious ceremonies of that type were infrequent. When they did happen, it usually served to publicize the joining of two families with mutual political or economic interests.\nThat political motivation was the primary influence for marital motivation in royal family\u2019s is common knowledge, less widely known is that economic concerns were the primary motivation for the non-aristocratic classes. For hundreds of years, families in this class would arrange the marriages of their children to further their economic interests. The children of leather tanners would marry the children of shoemakers, the children of prosperous farmers of grain would marry millers. Such arrangements helped consolidate economic activity \u2013 which would eventually lead to the rise of family-owned craft and industrial firms .\nSuch practices were also evident in the United States as well as England. Harvard historian Sven Beckert describes in The Monied Metropolis : New York City and the Consolidation of the American Bourgeoisie how the children of the owners of American industrial firms in the 19th century arranged the marriages of their children to those of the owners of mining companies, shipping firms, and British aristocrats to improve their business operations while Jackson Lears, a History professor at Rutgers University , in No Place of Grace: Antimodernism and the Transformation of American Culture , describes the familial ties which came to link cotton processing operations in England with plantations owners in the South.\nAs wealth accumulated over generations could be dissipated by an unwise alliance or the profligacy of an intemperate bachelor, parental pressures continued to promote the attitude that romantic love was not the most important consideration. Parents, however, could not match the influence of the views transmitted through literature and popular culture. Just as the Public Health Revolution promoted personal health practices, novels and short stories promoted the notion that the emotional union experienced via romantic love was far more desirable to look at marriage as a means to create strategic alliances. Marriage without love was described as stultifying, a cause for depression, it vindicated infidelity and all sorts of behaviors that would otherwise be unjustifiable.\nThe transformation happened over hundreds of years. According to Coontz\u2019s research , \u201cit\u2019s only in the last 50 years or so that we\u2019ve been marrying for love at all.\u201d The modern understanding of love and marriage is that there is now one person for us that is to address all of the needs once fulfilled by friends, family, and others within one\u2019s lived environment. This worldview places many new expectations on our spouses and can be both fulfilling and cause troubles that are novel. This view of love and marriage as divorced from the traditional roles which mandated child-rearing has impacted marriage in broader ways.\nOne recent example of the evolution of marriage in the United States stems from the Supreme Court\u2019s 5-4 decision in the Obergefell v. Hodges case on June 26, 2015. The decision held that state statutes against same-sex marriage and states that refuse to recognize same-sex marriages that occurred in jurisdictions that did allow it violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the Constitution. It\u2019s worth noting that the Majority Opinion , written by Justice Kennedy, twice cited Marriage, a History: How Love Conquered Marriage by Dr. Stephanie Coontz . This expansion of what marriage means along with other changes \u2013 such as the increase in no-fault divorce laws \u2013 have led some commentators to claim that marriage and the family as an institution as well as American society as a whole are harmed.\nThe answer to the National Bureau of Economic Research\u2019s question Is Making Divorce Easier Bad for Children? , for example, is yes. Using 40 years of census data segmented by states which allow for unilateral divorce, they highlight how such laws result in lower family incomes and children with lower education levels. But is this the whole story? Not at all. For one basing a broad argument on just two indicators is poor social science. The human experience is incredibly complex and a few statistics rarely reflect that. Secondly, there\u2019s an important and unaddressed counterfactual. Jewish people have long accepted marriage as a spiritual binding that can be legally ended by no-fault divorce, called a get , and yet their religion\u2019s share of household income is the highest in the United States and the Pew Research Center published research in 2016 which stated that they are the best-educated religious group.\nWhen marriage is conceived of as something invariable and \u2018unto death\u2019, any ambiguity or change can seem like an assault on what is seen across all human cultures as a spiritual merging of two people. And yet history shows that marriage as a rite and institution is often being adjusted to the everyday realities people face.\nPerceptions of marriage and the practices linked to it have varied drastically across different periods, regions, religions, and ethnic groups. As a cultural rite, custom, and institution \u2013 marriage has evolved alongside developments in law and society. In England, geopolitical concerns linked to royal succession helped lead to the normalization of divorce. Controversies tied to economic issues helped end the legal view that women become the property of men. In the United States after riots, pleas, protests, and considerations within the political sphere and rulings via the judicial process about marriage resulted in new civil norms being created. In the English-speaking world, and elsewhere, what was once primarily an economic arrangement influenced by political, religious, and financial concerns evolved into an emotional covenant.\nMarriage is fundamentally different now than it was 100 years ago. What marriage was 100 years ago was far different than it was 100 years before that. And what will marriage be like in 100 years? Who knows! If research findings described by Emily Willingham in Scientific American are true and life expectancy can be \u201chacked\u201d so that life expectancy rises to 150 years, it\u2019s certain to be different than it is now. Whatever comes to be, there is cause to ignore the prognostications of alarmists as to the future of marriage. National Center for Health Statistics data on Marriage and Divorce shows that over the past decade the U.S. divorce rate has recently declined. Data analysts have also published research that shows that the oft-cited \u201c50% divorce rate\u201d is inaccurate.\nSocieties make their own history, but they do not make it as they please. They do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given, and transmitted from the past. Understanding the historic shifts in the values, attitudes, beliefs, and laws linked to marriage can provide happily married couples cause for appreciation of what they now have. It can also give those in unhappy relationships fortitude in the face of social pressures which keep them in a relationship that has become dysfunctional. Until death do us part is certainly beautiful poetry. And yet history shows that when high aspirations cannot be reached, especially when our lives are now so much longer than the culture which first created that verse, we ought not to deny ourselves the freedom to start fresh due to social pressures.", "source_raw_text": "A brief examination of the differences between the society which birthed the \u2018Until death do us part\u2019 worldview and that of contemporary America provides several fascinating insights.

The passage from the vows which end in \u2018until death do us part\u2019 begins with a commitment to stay together \u201cfor better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health\u201d. The wording of this rite denoting permanent spiritual union is compelling poetry. And yet it\u2019s important to note that at the time that marriage was evolving into an institution, the human lifespan was almost half of what it is today. H.O. Lancaster was an Australian mathematical statistician affiliated with the University of Sydney that was awarded the Order of Australia for his work in math. Lancaster\u2019s study \u201c Expectations of Life \u201d offers an in-depth look at the life expectancy of English males before and after the period of the Book of Common Prayer was published. Lancaster collected a large body of data on the births and deaths of the aristocratic class, those most likely to be noted in such registers, from the years 1200 through 1745. Below is a timeline of life expectancy by 50-year periods that depicts his findings: 1200-1300: 43 years 1300-1400: 24 years 1400-1500: 48 years 1500-1550: 50 years 1550-1600: 47 years 1600-1650: 43 years 1650-1700: 41 years 1700-1745: 43 years Considering that the aristocratic class then, as now, was more likely to live longer , it\u2019s likely that the actual average life expectancy was several years lower than the ages listed here. Following the publication of research by Londoner and proto-epidemiologist John Snow, whose research on the cholera epidemi c had a tremendous impact on life in cities all over the world, along with the social advocacy of barrister Edwin Chadwick , the First Public Health Revolution began. The non-medical social improvements Snow and Chadwick helped initiate, such as public water treatment, food inspection, and waste management, would radically raise the average life expectancy rate. The later development of antibiotics like penicillin and advanced surgical techniques raised this number even more. What this means is that over the past 200 years the length a marriage was expected to last according to this view has more than doubled. If a couple married in 1600 when each was 24 and then died at 43, they\u2019d have been married for 19 years. That same couple today is statistically, according to the World Bank , likely to live until 81. This means is that this marriage would last for 57 years \u2013 which is 3 times as long as it was 400 years ago. What this means is that the midlife crisis that Brides author Cathy Meyer warns wives about and that PsychCentral and Healthline describe so that men can have information on how to be resilient in the face of distress was something that most of these women never faced. Similarly, the midlife crises which Cleveland Clinic describes women as going through were something that most men never dealt with. While supporting your partner in times of crisis is a core marital value \u2013 its extension across such a long period is novel. This is not the only aspect of marriage that has changed. In addition to the rise of life expectancy that has impacted marital relations, the role of religious and state institutions has also evolved alongside a transformation of what marriage means. According to the author of Marriage, a History: How Love Conquered Marriage , Stephanie Coontz, in the article The World-Historical Transformation of Marriage : \u201cFor more than a thousand years, the Catholic church took the position that if a man and woman claimed that they had exchanged words of consent, whether in the kitchen or out by the haystack then they were married.\u201d (Coontz 974). Similarly, according to sociologist Dr. Carol Smart of the University of Manchester, it wasn\u2019t until 1793 and the passage of the Clandestine Marriage Act that state involvement in marriage was significant. This act, effectively, ended the protections granted by common law marriage . Dr. Smart shared with the BBC that the act marked the beginning of state involvement by requiring couples to get married by a minister in a church or chapel otherwise the union would be considered invalid. Though by that time America had separated from England via political revolution, according to historic researches affiliated with PBS , many of the cultural values were still the same. The United States went through a similar transformation. Common-Law was adopted by the Colonies, however, in the 1800s, various states began to repeal these rights. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures , only eight U.S. states recognize common law marriage: Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah. The depiction of marriage shown in the above painting made is, in other words, relatively modern. Somber and public religious ceremonies of that type were infrequent. When they did happen, it usually served to publicize the joining of two families with mutual political or economic interests. That political motivation was the primary influence for marital motivation in royal family\u2019s is common knowledge, less widely known is that economic concerns were the primary motivation for the non-aristocratic classes. For hundreds of years, families in this class would arrange the marriages of their children to further their economic interests. The children of leather tanners would marry the children of shoemakers, the children of prosperous farmers of grain would marry millers. Such arrangements helped consolidate economic activity \u2013 which would eventually lead to the rise of family-owned craft and industrial firms . Such practices were also evident in the United States as well as England. Harvard historian Sven Beckert describes in The Monied Metropolis : New York City and the Consolidation of the American Bourgeoisie how the children of the owners of American industrial firms in the 19th century arranged the marriages of their children to those of the owners of mining companies, shipping firms, and British aristocrats to improve their business operations while Jackson Lears, a History professor at Rutgers University , in No Place of Grace: Antimodernism and the Transformation of American Culture , describes the familial ties which came to link cotton processing operations in England with plantations owners in the South. As wealth accumulated over generations could be dissipated by an unwise alliance or the profligacy of an intemperate bachelor, parental pressures continued to promote the attitude that romantic love was not the most important consideration. Parents, however, could not match the influence of the views transmitted through literature and popular culture. Just as the Public Health Revolution promoted personal health practices, novels and short stories promoted the notion that the emotional union experienced via romantic love was far more desirable to look at marriage as a means to create strategic alliances. Marriage without love was described as stultifying, a cause for depression, it vindicated infidelity and all sorts of behaviors that would otherwise be unjustifiable. The transformation happened over hundreds of years. According to Coontz\u2019s research , \u201cit\u2019s only in the last 50 years or so that we\u2019ve been marrying for love at all.\u201d The modern understanding of love and marriage is that there is now one person for us that is to address all of the needs once fulfilled by friends, family, and others within one\u2019s lived environment. This worldview places many new expectations on our spouses and can be both fulfilling and cause troubles that are novel. This view of love and marriage as divorced from the traditional roles which mandated child-rearing has impacted marriage in broader ways. One recent example of the evolution of marriage in the United States stems from the Supreme Court\u2019s 5-4 decision in the Obergefell v. Hodges case on June 26, 2015. The decision held that state statutes against same-sex marriage and states that refuse to recognize same-sex marriages that occurred in jurisdictions that did allow it violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the Constitution. It\u2019s worth noting that the Majority Opinion , written by Justice Kennedy, twice cited Marriage, a History: How Love Conquered Marriage by Dr. Stephanie Coontz . This expansion of what marriage means along with other changes \u2013 such as the increase in no-fault divorce laws \u2013 have led some commentators to claim that marriage and the family as an institution as well as American society as a whole are harmed. The answer to the National Bureau of Economic Research\u2019s question Is Making Divorce Easier Bad for Children? , for example, is yes. Using 40 years of census data segmented by states which allow for unilateral divorce, they highlight how such laws result in lower family incomes and children with lower education levels. But is this the whole story? Not at all. For one basing a broad argument on just two indicators is poor social science. The human experience is incredibly complex and a few statistics rarely reflect that. Secondly, there\u2019s an important and unaddressed counterfactual. Jewish people have long accepted marriage as a spiritual binding that can be legally ended by no-fault divorce, called a get , and yet their religion\u2019s share of household income is the highest in the United States and the Pew Research Center published research in 2016 which stated that they are the best-educated religious group. When marriage is conceived of as something invariable and \u2018unto death\u2019, any ambiguity or change can seem like an assault on what is seen across all human cultures as a spiritual merging of two people. And yet history shows that marriage as a rite and institution is often being adjusted to the everyday realities people face. Perceptions of marriage and the practices linked to it have varied drastically across different periods, regions, religions, and ethnic groups. As a cultural rite, custom, and institution \u2013 marriage has evolved alongside developments in law and society. In England, geopolitical concerns linked to royal succession helped lead to the normalization of divorce. Controversies tied to economic issues helped end the legal view that women become the property of men. In the United States after riots, pleas, protests, and considerations within the political sphere and rulings via the judicial process about marriage resulted in new civil norms being created. In the English-speaking world, and elsewhere, what was once primarily an economic arrangement influenced by political, religious, and financial concerns evolved into an emotional covenant. Marriage is fundamentally different now than it was 100 years ago. What marriage was 100 years ago was far different than it was 100 years before that. And what will marriage be like in 100 years? Who knows! If research findings described by Emily Willingham in Scientific American are true and life expectancy can be \u201chacked\u201d so that life expectancy rises to 150 years, it\u2019s certain to be different than it is now. Whatever comes to be, there is cause to ignore the prognostications of alarmists as to the future of marriage. National Center for Health Statistics data on Marriage and Divorce shows that over the past decade the U.S. divorce rate has recently declined. Data analysts have also published research that shows that the oft-cited \u201c50% divorce rate\u201d is inaccurate. Societies make their own history, but they do not make it as they please. They do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given, and transmitted from the past. Understanding the historic shifts in the values, attitudes, beliefs, and laws linked to marriage can provide happily married couples cause for appreciation of what they now have. It can also give those in unhappy relationships fortitude in the face of social pressures which keep them in a relationship that has become dysfunctional. Until death do us part is certainly beautiful poetry. And yet history shows that when high aspirations cannot be reached, especially when our lives are now so much longer than the culture which first created that verse, we ought not to deny ourselves the freedom to start fresh due to social pressures.", "documentFile": "https://www.kleinattorneys.com/a-brief-history-of-marriage-and-until-death-do-us-part/"}], "set_of_highlights_in_context": [{"source_supports_statement": "complete_support", "docSentText": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nTill Death Do Us Part , Til Death Do Us Part or Till Death Us Do Part is a well-known phrase from the marriage liturgy in the Book of Common Prayer .", "docSpanText": "Till Death Do Us Part , Til Death Do<HIGHLIGHT_SEP>or Till Death Us Do Part is a well-known phrase from the marriage liturgy in the Book of Common Prayer .", "docSentCharIdx": 0.0, "problematic_instance": "no", "is_split": "no", "docSpanOffsets": [[38, 74], [83, 187]], "sent_idx": 0.0, "scuSentence": "\"Till death do us part\" is a well-known phrase from the marriage liturgy in the Book of Common Prayer.", "scuSentCharIdx": 0, "documentFile": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Till_Death_Do_Us_Part", "statement_supported": "Yes", "prefix": ""}, {"source_supports_statement": "complete_support", "docSentText": "The phrase \u201cuntil death do us part\u201d was first popularized in the English-speaking world following the first printing of the Book of Common Prayer in England in 1549.", "docSpanText": "The phrase \u201cuntil death do us part\u201d was first popularized in the English-speaking world following the first printing of the Book of Common Prayer in England in 1549.", "docSentCharIdx": 2050.0, "problematic_instance": "no", "is_split": "no", "docSpanOffsets": [[2050, 2215]], "sent_idx": 13.0, "scuSentence": "It was first popularized in the English-speaking world following the first printing of the Book of Common Prayer in England in 1549.", "scuSentCharIdx": 103, "documentFile": "https://www.kleinattorneys.com/a-brief-history-of-marriage-and-until-death-do-us-part/", "statement_supported": "Yes", "prefix": "\"Till death do us part\" is a well-known phrase from the marriage liturgy in the Book of Common Prayer.

have ultimately really embraced your character and you on the show, when they really could have easily had the opposite reaction with a character like this?\nRAMAMURTHY: Totally!", "I\u2019ve been really surprised.", "In a way, it makes it easier because, if you\u2019re not worried about whether the audience likes you or not, it\u2019s actually quite freeing.", "You can just go and have fun

is part human, too.", "His moral compass is definitely in the grey zone, and those are always the most fun characters to play.", "I\u2019m hoping that, at some point, something is put in front of him

Season's Threats and New Beasts, and More\nThe CW drama series Beauty and the Beast returns for Season 2 in a very different place with its characters. Vincent ( Jay Ryan ) has changed now that his memory has been wiped clean, and he\u2019s a super-charged beast on a mysterious mission. At the same time, Catherine Chandler ( Kristin Kreuk ) needs to unravel the reasons behind Vincent\u2019s change, if she has any hope of recovering their epic love, while also trying to solve the secrets that swirl around her own life. With the help of friends J.T. ( Austin Basis ), Tess ( Nina Lisandrello ) and reformed ADA Gabe Lowan ( Sendhil Ramamurthy ), Cat is determined to get answers and save her soulmate.\nDuring this recent phone interview with Collider, actor Sendhil Ramamurthy talked about when he learned he\u2019d be returning for Season 2, what Gabe\u2019s overall arc will be for the first eight episodes, how everything he\u2019s been through has affected him in a positive way, how Gabe is coping without being a beast anymore, how relieved he is not to have to wear the beast make-up, how his relationships with the other characters have changed, where the threats are coming from this season, new beasts, and how surprised he\u2019s been about how much the fans have embraced him and his character. Check out what he had to say after the jump, and be aware that there are some spoilers .\nCollider: At what point did you know that Gabe wasn\u2019t actually dead and that you would be returning for Season 2?\nSENDHIL RAMAMURTHY: We didn\u2019t know, at all, that there was going to be a Season 2 when we wrapped last season. We hadn\u2019t been picked up yet. But, they told me before the finale episode. Before they gave it to us, they called me and told me, \u201cListen, the cliffhanger is that you\u2019re gonna get shot, but if we come back, you\u2019re coming back.\u201d But, I wasn\u2019t allowed to tell anybody, so I just played dumb for a few months.\nWere you very curious about how they would pull that off?\nRAMAMURTHY: Yeah. My main concern was, \u201cHow are they gonna do it? Is it going to be some miraculous thing, or is it going to be something that we explore, as the season goes on? Is it going to be something that either Gabe or the other characters try to figure out?\u201d I didn\u2019t want it to just be one miracle that happens. I didn\u2019t want him to just get saved, and that\u2019s it. He\u2019s back and he\u2019s Gabe, and he\u2019s not a beast. Everything is good. That wouldn\u2019t really make sense. So, the way that they\u2019ve done it is cool because it becomes part of his main mission, certainly in this first arc of eight episodes that we\u2019re doing in the second season. He\u2019s trying to figure out exactly how that happened. Nobody quite understands how he was saved. It really is a fortunate accident, from Gabe\u2019s point of view, that he was saved. He and others want to figure out how it works.\nObviously, the main thing for Gabe is that he feels the only way he\u2019s going to be able to make amends and try to ingratiate himself to these people that, quite frankly, he did some pretty horrendous things to in the first season, is to help in finding Vincent, and then once they find Vincent, trying to cure him and trying to save him. They\u2019ve incorporated that really well into Gabe\u2019s overall arc through these first eight episodes. We\u2019re in the middle of shooting Episode 7 right now. It becomes his obsession to figure out exactly how that happened. He doesn\u2019t know, and Catherine doesn\u2019t know. It just happened. So, it\u2019s explored more, as the episodes go on. What occurred that cured him of being a beast is the holy grail for these characters, so we definitely explore it.\nDo you feel like everything he\u2019s gone through, since we last left these characters, has affected him in a positive way?\nRAMAMURTHY: Definitely! It\u2019s helped him grow. The circumstances dictated how he has to behave. Gabe is still Gabe. He can still be arrogant. He can still be cocky. He\u2019s still a wealthy guy who\u2019s used to getting his way. He really has very shaky moral ground, and he\u2019s standing on it. One of the things that I really like about Gabe this season is that he\u2019s cured. In the first minute of the premiere episode, he is cured, he\u2019s alive, and he\u2019s not a beast anymore. He\u2019s just loaded. He\u2019s super rich. He could just take off and go have a great life somewhere else, but he doesn\u2019t. He stays. He keeps his government job of being an ADA, and he stays in a place where nobody wants him and nobody likes him, and they make it very clear. They don\u2019t want him there, and that\u2019s understandable. Why would they?\nIt\u2019s important to him that he make amends and he tries to set things right, even if he\u2019s ultimately not successful. In my head, what I\u2019ve been thinking is that he\u2019s gotta make the effort. If he doesn\u2019t make the effort, then he really can\u2019t go on and live any sort of fulfilling life, as a beastless human being. I\u2019m really enjoying playing that because the writers don\u2019t make it easy on Gabe. In every scene, certainly for the first few episodes, they make it very clear that they don\u2019t want him there, especially Tess and J.T. They\u2019re slinging their one-liners mostly at Gabe, and he just has to take it on the chin. He understands that. It\u2019s not fun, but he gets it. Eventually, hopefully, he can try to win these guys over and show them that he means well now. That was a part of him that is gone. Or is it? Who knows? I don\u2019t know the answer to that.\nGabe must have to get to know himself again, without having the beast there anymore?\nRAMAMURTHY: Completely! He has to figure out how friendships work. Maybe further on down the line, he\u2019s going to have to figure out how relationships work, as a normal person. That\u2019s not something that he\u2019s used to. That\u2019s not something he\u2019s ever had. And I\u2019m looking forward to all of that because it\u2019s juicy. It\u2019s fun stuff to play, as an actor.\nAre you bummed out that Gabe\u2019s beast is gone, or are you more like, \u201cThank god, I don\u2019t have to put on that make-up again\u201d?\nRAMAMURTHY: It\u2019s mainly the latter. They\u2019ve changed the look of the beast, so that the application of the prosthetic onto Jay [Ryan] and onto the beasts that are entering the show slowly is less tedious, but it still sucks. It\u2019s still not something that you want to go through. So, I\u2019ve gotta say that there\u2019s very little that I miss about being a beast, if I\u2019m being totally honest. It\u2019s just not a fun experience to go through. I like the physicality in doing the different physical motions, being a beast. I really enjoyed that, and getting to do the fights and the stunt stuff. That was really cool. I don\u2019t know if that will come into play later for Gabe, as a human. I have no idea. But so far, he\u2019s pretty human and he\u2019s made to feel human, a lot. He\u2019s put in physical danger, a lot of times. Certainly in my head, while I was playing the scenes, I was thinking, \u201cGod, it would have been really great just to be a beast for these three minutes, so that I wouldn\u2019t be getting my butt kicked, right now by this guy.\u201d But overall, the overriding feeling is, \u201cThank god, Gabe\u2019s beast is no longer alive.\u201d\nWhat are his feelings toward Catherine now? Is she still a means to an end for him, or do you think he would ever pursue something more with her, if he thought she\u2019d be open to it?\nRAMAMURTHY: I think, right now, it\u2019s much like all the other characters. It\u2019s a win, if he can get them not to hate him. He\u2019s setting the bar fairly low, just out of necessity. The main thing for him is to make amends. There\u2019s some therapy in his future, as far as being able to have relationships with people. And I hear relationships are going to be explored. But right now, he\u2019s just gotta try to see if he can make things right, or as right as possible, with these people. He knows that he wronged them, in a really, really fundamentally horrible, bad way. I like exploring more of the humanity of Gabe. It\u2019s important to him that he tries to make amends and he tries to make things right, even if he\u2019s not ultimately successful.\nIt would certainly be interesting to see how he would interact with and react to a love interest, at this point, now that he is a different person.\nRAMAMURTHY: Exactly! Before, relationships that he had romantically certainly were more of a means to an end type of thing. I don\u2019t know that there were true feelings or true love. I don\u2019t know if he was capable of true love when he had that beast inside him. Maybe he is now. I don\u2019t know. Maybe that\u2019s just who he is. Maybe he\u2019s not capable of love. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m curious to find out and explore that side of him, at some point.\nHow does Gabe feel about Vincent\u2019s memory loss? Is it a good thing, as far as he\u2019s concerned, especially after what went down between them?\nRAMAMURTHY: Certainly, at the beginning, it\u2019s great for Gabe. Vincent is the only person that doesn\u2019t hate him because he doesn\u2019t remember what happened. The one person that he tried to kill four months ago is the only one who doesn\u2019t really remember that, which is great for Gabe. But on the whole, Vincent is not in the happiest of places right now. He really doesn\u2019t know whether he\u2019s coming or going, and that\u2019s something that we really get into. How must that be, for one person to literally not remember the other person, when they have this epic love? In one sense, it\u2019s sad and tragic. But on the other side, they\u2019re going to explore it all, all over again. They\u2019re going to get to fall in love, hopefully, all over again, and experience their first kiss, all over again. I think that\u2019s going to be really exciting for the audience to see that again. But having said that, it\u2019s not going to be easy. The obstacles that are put in front of Vincent and Catherine, throughout the season, really make both of them question if what they\u2019re going through to achieve this love is worth it. It takes a lot out of them, on both sides.\nBoth Vincent and Catherine have to make some really huge sacrifices, as you\u2019ll see as the episodes go on, and both of them question whether they\u2019re doing the right thing. Vincent is off doing these missions, as we\u2019ll get more into, as the episodes go on. You\u2019ll learn about why he\u2019s doing what he\u2019s doing. Catherine has become completely consumed with finding Vincent. And then, once we find it, it becomes about whether we can cure him and make him normal. I think they both question whether that\u2019s worth it. And then, from Gabe\u2019s point of view, we also are going to start finding out what his real motivation is. Is it all just about wanting to make amends and make things right? The situations that he\u2019s put in, his life is in danger. There\u2019s physical danger and then there are emotional traps that are set for Gabe, that we\u2019re just starting to get into now, that he\u2019s not really equipped to deal with. He\u2019s never been in that situation because he had this beast inside of him, and I don\u2019t know if he knows how to handle it. In that sense, it\u2019s fun stuff to mine, as an actor. The stakes are so much higher this season, for all the characters, because so much more is on the line. But, it\u2019s been great to far. We\u2019re having a great time.\nThe subtle changes in Jay Ryan\u2019s performance just make Vincent feel so different this season. Has it been strange to play scenes with him now, and have it really feel like such a different dynamic?\nRAMAMURTHY: Totally! In the second episode, there is a meeting between human Gabe and beast Vincent. I can tease that. And it\u2019s a tough one for Gabe because he doesn\u2019t have the power. Before, he was physically more powerful than Vincent. Now, Vincent can squish him like a grape. It\u2019s a scary situation to be in. I like the way that that scene goes because Gabe has other tools in his arsenal. He has to use his brain. He has to use his wits. He has to use other things that are available, as a human being, as opposed to being a super-charged beast. It\u2019s been fun to play that.\nWhere are the threats coming from this season, now that there isn\u2019t one specific threat to worry about? Does that make things more dangerous for them?\nRAMAMURTHY: It does. The good thing about it, from our point of view, is that we\u2019re all unified against this bad person or entity, or whatever it ends up being, as we figure it out. There are other beasts that are going to come in and be involved. In the third episode, a new beast appears and we\u2019re tracking this new beast. There are scenes where we\u2019re all there, in the scene. Me, Kristin [Kreuk], Jay [Ryan], Austin [Basis] and Nina [Lisandrello] all get to do scenes together, as the five of us. We really didn\u2019t get a chance to do that last season because there was the beast over here and the people over here. It\u2019s united the core group of characters with a single goal, and that\u2019s been fun to play. I\u2019ve actually worked a lot with Nina this season, which has been really fun to do because I didn\u2019t really have much to do with her, at all, last season. And I\u2019m getting to do some more stuff with Austin, too, and even with Jay.\nAre you surprised by how much the fans have ultimately really embraced your character and you on the show, when they really could have easily had the opposite reaction with a character like this?\nRAMAMURTHY: Totally! I\u2019ve been really surprised. In a way, it makes it easier because, if you\u2019re not worried about whether the audience likes you or not, it\u2019s actually quite freeing. You can just go and have fun with the material, which is what I ended up doing. But, the writers were really clever, in that they gave me this backstory that I could really hold onto, that was really tragic. This was done to Gabe as a child. He was abducted and unknowingly had a hand in killing his adopted parents. That\u2019s juicy stuff to have in the back of your head, when you\u2019re doing horrible, hideous stuff. It doesn\u2019t give you an out, but it can help the audience sympathize with the circumstances that made you go and do these kinds of things. I was totally shocked, I have to say, but glad.\nIt\u2019s certainly a very juicy character for me to play, and I really am grateful that I\u2019m having the chance to do it. And I hope that continues. I don\u2019t want Gabe to just be a saint now, and a good guy. I want him to be challenged, morally, because it\u2019s clearly in him. I don\u2019t think that was all beast. Making some of the decisions that he made, that is part human, too. His moral compass is definitely in the grey zone, and those are always the most fun characters to play. I\u2019m hoping that, at some point, something is put in front of him where he has to make a choice, and maybe he makes the choice that isn\u2019t what the good character would do. I don\u2019t really want to be the good character. It\u2019s more fun to be a little bit of both.\nBeauty and the Beast is on Monday nights on The CW.", "source_raw_text": "By Sendhil Ramamurthy Talks BEAUTY AND THE BEAST Season 2, Gabe's Arc for the First 8 Episodes, the Season's Threats and New Beasts, and More The CW drama series Beauty and the Beast returns for Season 2 in a very different place with its characters. Vincent ( Jay Ryan ) has changed now that his memory has been wiped clean, and he\u2019s a super-charged beast on a mysterious mission. At the same time, Catherine Chandler ( Kristin Kreuk ) needs to unravel the reasons behind Vincent\u2019s change, if she has any hope of recovering their epic love, while also trying to solve the secrets that swirl around her own life. With the help of friends J.T. ( Austin Basis ), Tess ( Nina Lisandrello ) and reformed ADA Gabe Lowan ( Sendhil Ramamurthy ), Cat is determined to get answers and save her soulmate. During this recent phone interview with Collider, actor Sendhil Ramamurthy talked about when he learned he\u2019d be returning for Season 2, what Gabe\u2019s overall arc will be for the first eight episodes, how everything he\u2019s been through has affected him in a positive way, how Gabe is coping without being a beast anymore, how relieved he is not to have to wear the beast make-up, how his relationships with the other characters have changed, where the threats are coming from this season, new beasts, and how surprised he\u2019s been about how much the fans have embraced him and his character. Check out what he had to say after the jump, and be aware that there are some spoilers . Collider: At what point did you know that Gabe wasn\u2019t actually dead and that you would be returning for Season 2? SENDHIL RAMAMURTHY: We didn\u2019t know, at all, that there was going to be a Season 2 when we wrapped last season. We hadn\u2019t been picked up yet. But, they told me before the finale episode. Before they gave it to us, they called me and told me, \u201cListen, the cliffhanger is that you\u2019re gonna get shot, but if we come back, you\u2019re coming back.\u201d But, I wasn\u2019t allowed to tell anybody, so I just played dumb for a few months. Were you very curious about how they would pull that off? RAMAMURTHY: Yeah. My main concern was, \u201cHow are they gonna do it? Is it going to be some miraculous thing, or is it going to be something that we explore, as the season goes on? Is it going to be something that either Gabe or the other characters try to figure out?\u201d I didn\u2019t want it to just be one miracle that happens. I didn\u2019t want him to just get saved, and that\u2019s it. He\u2019s back and he\u2019s Gabe, and he\u2019s not a beast. Everything is good. That wouldn\u2019t really make sense. So, the way that they\u2019ve done it is cool because it becomes part of his main mission, certainly in this first arc of eight episodes that we\u2019re doing in the second season. He\u2019s trying to figure out exactly how that happened. Nobody quite understands how he was saved. It really is a fortunate accident, from Gabe\u2019s point of view, that he was saved. He and others want to figure out how it works. Obviously, the main thing for Gabe is that he feels the only way he\u2019s going to be able to make amends and try to ingratiate himself to these people that, quite frankly, he did some pretty horrendous things to in the first season, is to help in finding Vincent, and then once they find Vincent, trying to cure him and trying to save him. They\u2019ve incorporated that really well into Gabe\u2019s overall arc through these first eight episodes. We\u2019re in the middle of shooting Episode 7 right now. It becomes his obsession to figure out exactly how that happened. He doesn\u2019t know, and Catherine doesn\u2019t know. It just happened. So, it\u2019s explored more, as the episodes go on. What occurred that cured him of being a beast is the holy grail for these characters, so we definitely explore it. Do you feel like everything he\u2019s gone through, since we last left these characters, has affected him in a positive way? RAMAMURTHY: Definitely! It\u2019s helped him grow. The circumstances dictated how he has to behave. Gabe is still Gabe. He can still be arrogant. He can still be cocky. He\u2019s still a wealthy guy who\u2019s used to getting his way. He really has very shaky moral ground, and he\u2019s standing on it. One of the things that I really like about Gabe this season is that he\u2019s cured. In the first minute of the premiere episode, he is cured, he\u2019s alive, and he\u2019s not a beast anymore. He\u2019s just loaded. He\u2019s super rich. He could just take off and go have a great life somewhere else, but he doesn\u2019t. He stays. He keeps his government job of being an ADA, and he stays in a place where nobody wants him and nobody likes him, and they make it very clear. They don\u2019t want him there, and that\u2019s understandable. Why would they? It\u2019s important to him that he make amends and he tries to set things right, even if he\u2019s ultimately not successful. In my head, what I\u2019ve been thinking is that he\u2019s gotta make the effort. If he doesn\u2019t make the effort, then he really can\u2019t go on and live any sort of fulfilling life, as a beastless human being. I\u2019m really enjoying playing that because the writers don\u2019t make it easy on Gabe. In every scene, certainly for the first few episodes, they make it very clear that they don\u2019t want him there, especially Tess and J.T. They\u2019re slinging their one-liners mostly at Gabe, and he just has to take it on the chin. He understands that. It\u2019s not fun, but he gets it. Eventually, hopefully, he can try to win these guys over and show them that he means well now. That was a part of him that is gone. Or is it? Who knows? I don\u2019t know the answer to that. Gabe must have to get to know himself again, without having the beast there anymore? RAMAMURTHY: Completely! He has to figure out how friendships work. Maybe further on down the line, he\u2019s going to have to figure out how relationships work, as a normal person. That\u2019s not something that he\u2019s used to. That\u2019s not something he\u2019s ever had. And I\u2019m looking forward to all of that because it\u2019s juicy. It\u2019s fun stuff to play, as an actor. Are you bummed out that Gabe\u2019s beast is gone, or are you more like, \u201cThank god, I don\u2019t have to put on that make-up again\u201d? RAMAMURTHY: It\u2019s mainly the latter. They\u2019ve changed the look of the beast, so that the application of the prosthetic onto Jay [Ryan] and onto the beasts that are entering the show slowly is less tedious, but it still sucks. It\u2019s still not something that you want to go through. So, I\u2019ve gotta say that there\u2019s very little that I miss about being a beast, if I\u2019m being totally honest. It\u2019s just not a fun experience to go through. I like the physicality in doing the different physical motions, being a beast. I really enjoyed that, and getting to do the fights and the stunt stuff. That was really cool. I don\u2019t know if that will come into play later for Gabe, as a human. I have no idea. But so far, he\u2019s pretty human and he\u2019s made to feel human, a lot. He\u2019s put in physical danger, a lot of times.

He\u2019s really adamant about going after this guy and you\u2019ll start to wonder. He wants to get the guy, it\u2019s his job but this is above and beyond. As the episodes go on, we\u2019ll find out that he has a slightly different reason than Joe ( Brian White ) and the rest of the cops for going after this guy and wanting to find out what\u2019s going on. That\u2019s the mystery behind this character for the rest of the season, especially the episode we\u2019re shooting now. It\u2019s revealed what he\u2019s really up to and what motivates him. You\u2019ll also start to find out connections with other characters that Gabe has.\nTHR: How soon will the reveals be made?\nRamamurthy: It isn\u2019t slowly revealed. There are big reveals in each episode. As a viewer, you get annoyed when they\u2019re treading water. The advantage of bringing Gabe in for the back nine episodes is you\u2019ve got a short period of time to reveal everything. For the audience, it\u2019s satisfying.\nTHR: So Gabe\u2019s presence accelerates everything in the precinct, which means there\u2019s more urgency on Catherine\u2019s part.\nRamamurthy: Gabe\u2019s presence lights a fire under everybody\u2019s rear ends because he\u2019s literally just there hanging over everyone asking, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you doing this, why aren\u2019t you doing that?\u201d I don\u2019t think he likes the fact that people aren\u2019t going after this with the same zeal that he is. He lives and breathes this case, and yeah, that\u2019s weird. People are like, yes, we get it, we have to get the vigilante, but this guy is way over the top as far as they\u2019re concerned. For Gabe, he doesn\u2019t get that at all. We\u2019ll find out very quickly after his introduction. It\u2019s very clever. The stakes go up a lot in the next few episodes. It feels like the show has turned a corner.\nTHR: We posted a scene of Gabe\u2019s first trip the precinct, and it\u2019s clear from his encounter with Catherine that he is going to have his hands full. How would you describe their dynamic?\nRamamurthy: The relationship between Catherine and Gabe, at first, is quite flirtatious but Gabe\u2019s flirtatious with everybody. It\u2019s one of his weapons in his arsenal that he uses to get what he wants. As the episodes go on, you\u2019ll see he has a lot more weapons in his arsenal. He\u2019s very crafty in trying to get what he wants. Their relationship is certainly adversarial; certainly right now they don\u2019t necessarily see eye to eye on a lot of things. Unbeknownst to Gabe, Catherine knows who the vigilante is. Gabe senses very quickly that something is up with Catherine; he doesn\u2019t know what and it becomes him trying to find out what\u2019s going on. There\u2019s a lot of tension there at first, and as things are revealed, we\u2019ll see their pasts connected. Gabe has a connection to Catherine\u2019s past and that\u2019s a huge reveal for the show and sends the show to the finale.\nTHR: Is he a love interest for Catherine?\nRamamurthy: There certainly is a connection there, but I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s going to go in the love interest direction. Maybe some time further down the line. Right now, they\u2019re at loggerheads. There\u2019s not a lot of romantic tension.\nTHR: How close does Gabe get to figuring out who the vigilante is and that Catherine is protecting Vincent?\nRamamurthy: He\u2019s a pretty clever guy and he starts to figure things out really quickly. Whether he\u2019s going to figure out that Vincent is the beast and all of that, I don\u2019t know yet. We just got the 19th episode, so maybe he\u2019s going to find out in that episode. He\u2019s getting very suspicious and very close, and information starts to come out about Gabe, Catherine, Vincent that really amp up the tension, especially when it comes to Muirfield. We don\u2019t know if Gabe is involved. That\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s explored: Is he working for Muirfield? Is he not?\nTHR: Your character Jai was killed on Covert Affairs in the season three premiere. Are you ever worried that Gabe may not be long for this world, at least on Beauty and the Beast ?\nRamamurthy: Listen, that\u2019s totally a possibility. There is every possibility that there is going to be death this season. That\u2019s the case with any show like this. Lord knows I\u2019ve been on a show like that where every episode you didn\u2019t know if your character was going to die for four seasons.\nTHR: Is there a scene that you recently shot that we should look out for?\nRamamurthy: Yeah, we just shot it on Friday (March 8). It was the hardest scene I\u2019ve ever done, and it was the longest scene that I\u2019ve ever done on television. It was a six-page scene, just between Gabe and Catherine. We shot the whole thing through, we didn\u2019t break it up. It\u2019s two people talking in a room, and you think, \u201cOh wow, how exciting is that?\u201d But it\u2019s what comes out. A hundred pennies drop in that scene and so much information and backstory come out, and the way it\u2019s done is clever. That\u2019s probably my favorite scene that I\u2019ve shot so far, and it\u2019ll be in episode 18.\nBeauty and the Beast airs at 9 p.m. Thursdays on The CW.\nE-mail: Philiana.Ng@thr.com\nTwitter: @insidethetube", "source_raw_text": "\"He comes in and he ruffles a lot of feathers right off the bat.

A native of San Antonio, Texas , Ramamurthy is best known for his roles as geneticist Mohinder Suresh in the NBC sci-fi drama Heroes , Gabriel \"Gabe\" Lowan in Beauty and the Beast , and Jai Wilcox in Covert Affairs . Ramamurthy was born in Chicago to a Hindu family who emigrated from India; his father is a Kannadiga [1] and his mother is a Tamil from the Pillai community. [2] [1] He grew up speaking English and some Kannada . [1] His parents are physicians. [3] [4] He has one sister who is also a physician. He and his sister were raised in San Antonio . There, he went to Keystone School and graduated in 1991. Ramamurthy attended Tufts University initially as a pre-med major to follow in his parents' footsteps. [5] He was also a member of the Kappa Charge of Theta Delta Chi . He became interested in acting when he took an \"Intro to Acting\" class during his junior year as part of his graduation requirement. After participating in several plays, including Our Country's Good , he chose to change career goals. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in history and then attended the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London in 1996, graduating in 1998. [5] [6] He made a conscious decision to not audition for stereotypical Indian roles, although he has been offered such parts. [5] Ramamurthy's role on Heroes was his biggest to date. Although the character of Mohinder Suresh was originally written for a 55-year-old, his audition tape and screen test were convincing enough for writers to rewrite the part for Ramamurthy. Ramamurthy starred in all four seasons of Heroes , although his appearance in the final season was limited; had the series been recommissioned for a fifth season, he would not have returned for it. [8] In 2000, he appeared in NBC 's television biblical miniseries In the Beginning in the role of Adam. Ramamurthy guest starred in a season four episode of Psych titled \"Bollywood Homicide\", directed by his cousin Jay Chandrasekhar . [9] Ramamurthy joined the cast of the USA Network show Covert Affairs as Jai Wilcox from the second episode onward, replacing character Conrad Sheehan III, played by Eric Lively in the pilot. [10] The show premiered in July 2010. [11] In the season 3 premiere, his character was killed off. [12] Ramamurthy appeared in the eighth and ninth season of The Office as Kelly Kapoor 's new boyfriend, Ravi. [13] On December 19, 2012, it was announced that he would appear in the CW show Beauty & the Beast as Gabriel Lowen, an assistant district attorney. [14] He appeared in his Heroes role in that series's continuation entitled Heroes Reborn , in 2015 and 2016. He appeared as Dr. Ramsey Rosso/Bloodwork in the sixth season of the television series The Flash . As of 2020, he is part of the cast of the new Netflix series Never Have I Ever , playing Mohan Vishwakumar, the main character's father. [15] The series is produced by Mindy Kaling , who had first worked with Ramamurthy when she was a writer and actor on The Office . [16] In 2022, Ramamurthy appeared in season four of Doom Patrol as Mister 104. In 1999, Ramamurthy married actress Olga Sosnovska .

The film stars Mark Rylance , Ruby Barnhill in her film debut, Penelope Wilton , Jemaine Clement , Rebecca Hall , Rafe Spall and Bill Hader . In the film, a 10-year-old orphaned girl named Sophie befriends a benevolent giant dubbed the \"Big Friendly Giant\", who takes her to Giant Country, where they attempt to stop the man-eating giants that are invading the human world.\nKathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall began development on a live-action adaptation of The BFG back in the 1990s, and various screenwriters were hired to work on the screenplay in the subsequent years. DreamWorks acquired the screen rights to Dahl's book in September 2011, and Marshall and Sam Mercer joined as producers, Mathison as screenwriter and Kennedy as executive producer. Spielberg was announced as director in April 2014, alongside his production company Amblin Entertainment as co-producer. Principal photography commenced in March 2015, marking Spielberg's first directorial film for Walt Disney Pictures , which co-financed the film. [10]\nThe BFG premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 14, 2016, and held its North American debut at the El Capitan Theater on June 21, 2016. [11] The film was released in the United States in Disney Digital 3D , RealD 3D , IMAX 3D , [12] and conventional theatrical formats on July 1, 2016, the same year of Dahl's centennial . It received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its visuals, direction, performances and entertainment value. However, the film was a box office bomb , grossing $195 million against its $140 million budget. [13] [14] [15] [16]\nSophie, a 10-year-old girl living in a London orphanage, is often awake at the \" witching hour \". One night, she shouts at some men in an alleyway. Later, she sees an elderly Giant Man outside her window, who captures her and takes her to his home in Giant Country. He explains that he cannot allow Sophie to return to her world and reveal the existence of giants. If she ventures out alone, she may be eaten by the nine much larger giants.\nIn his workshop of dreams, the giant fashions a nightmare to convince the sleeping Sophie to stay with him in safety. The Fleshlumpeater, the infantile leader of the man-eating giants, intrudes and demands a \" boo-boo \" on his finger to be fixed. He smells Sophie, but the elderly giant convinces him to leave. Sophie persuades the friendly giant to take her to visit Dream Country. They accidentally awaken the other giants, and after the Bloodbottler suggests they \"frolic\", they bully the friendly giant. A thunderstorm drives the man-eating giants into their cave, but the Fleshlumpeater finds Sophie's dropped blanket.\nIn Dream Country, Sophie and the friendly giant catch good and bad dreams. The giant reveals that his only name \u2013 besides \"Runt\", the other giants' nickname for him \u2013 is \"the Big Friendly Giant\", which leads Sophie to call him \"BFG\". She accompanies him to London for his nightly work: using his dream trumpet to spread good dreams to sleeping children. They return to Giant Country just as the other giants have finished eating children worldwide. The BFG realizes that Sophie has lost her blanket, exposing her presence to the other giants, and leaves her outside her orphanage. Explaining that his last human companion liked to read, and even taught The BFG how to read, but sadly The Boy was discovered and eaten by the giants, he is unwilling to endanger Sophie and departs. Unafraid, Sophie jumps off her balcony in the hope he will appear again to catch her, and he does.\nThey return to the BFG's workshop and the other giants barge in, hunting for Sophie. They destroy much of the BFG's work, but Sophie evades detection and the BFG drives them off with a hot iron. Sophie finds the home of the last human to live with the BFG, with a portrait of Queen Victoria among his belongings. This inspires her to devise a plan: to forge a nightmare for Elizabeth II , the Queen of the United Kingdom , about giants eating the children of England, the British Army fighting the giants, and Sophie appearing to her.\nSophie and the BFG go to Buckingham Palace and deliver the nightmare to the sleeping Queen. Upon waking, the Queen and members of her staff Mary and Mr Tibbs find Sophie on the windowsill. She introduces them to the BFG, explaining that the child-eating giants are real and must be stopped. At a large breakfast, the BFG shares his favourite drink, flatulence -inducing \"frobscottle\", and he and Sophie lead the Queen's soldiers to Giant Country.\nThe BFG plans to ambush the man-eating giants with a nightmare but has forgotten his dream trumpet. Sophie carries the nightmare herself into the midst of the giants and is confronted by the Fleshlumpeater. She releases the nightmare which consumes the giants with guilt, except the unregretful Fleshlumpeater (who intercepts and destroys his), and they are trapped by military helicopters. Carried away to an isolated island, the giants are left with only \"snozzcumbers\", a disgusting vegetable, to plant and eat, much to their despair.\nSophie gets adopted by Mary, comes to live in the Queen's palace, and awakens from a dream of the BFG, who returns to his life at Giant Country and writes the story of their adventure. She speaks to him whenever she feels lonely; at his home, the BFG hears her words and smiles.\n- Mark Rylance as the Big Friendly Giant (BFG), an elderly, benevolent 24-foot giant . He is called \"Runt\" by the other giants. [17]\n- Ruby Barnhill as Sophie, an orphan who befriends The BFG. [18] Dahl named her after his own mother, who was similarly caring and determined.\n- Jemaine Clement as The Fleshlumpeater, an aquaphobic 54-foot giant who is the de facto leader of the man-eating giants. He shows no regret for consuming children over the years. [19]\n- Rebecca Hall as Mary, Queen Elizabeth's maid and Sophie's mother. [19]\n- Rafe Spall as Mr. Tibbs, Queen Elizabeth's butler. [20]\n- Bill Hader as the Bloodbottler, a disheveled 43-foot man-eating giant with cowlick hair who is Fleshlumpeater's advisor and the most intelligent of the group. [21]\n- Michael Adamthwaite as the Butcher Boy, an overweight, immature man-eating giant who is the youngest of the group. He collects cars and wears clothes made of circus tents. [19]\n- Daniel Bacon as the Bonecruncher, a dark-skinned, bald-headed man-eating giant. As the name suggests, he loves to crunch on the bones of his victims like candy. It's said he can be heard crunching bones for miles. [19]\n- Chris Gibbs as the Gizzardgulper, a burly, bearded 39-foot man-eating giant who wears a helmet and is the shortest of the group. [19]\n- Adam Godley as the Manhugger, a very tall and slim man-eating giant who wears a vest and shorts. He seems to be the laziest of them all. [19]\n- Paul Moniz de Sa as the Meatdripper, a well-groomed man-eating giant with Mohawk hair. He also is the most serious about hunting in the group, clearly more determined than the rest to find Sophie. he doesn't wear a shirt, and has red shorts. [19]\n- Jonathan Holmes as the Childchewer, a balding man-eating giant who is Meatdripper's best friend. He obviously enjoys human child the most out of the giants, and eats only children. [19]\n- \u00d3lafur Darri \u00d3lafsson as the Maidmasher, a small-headed man-eating giant. He has short thin hair, and as the name suggests, likes to smash maidens. Either with his teeth, hands or feet. It is never expanded on. [19]\n- Marilyn Norry as Mrs. Clonkers, the head of the orphanage where Sophie was living.\n- Chris Shields, Matt Frewer , and Geoffrey Wade as The Queen's Generals\nAdamthwaite, Bacon, Gibbs, Godley, Holmes, Moniz de Sa, and \u00d3lafsson also make cameos as minor London characters. William Samples and Ruby Barnhill's father, Paul Barnhill, make cameos as the palace staff members.\nProducers Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy began development on a live-action adaptation of The BFG in 1991, and set the project up at Paramount Pictures . [22] Husband and wife screenwriters Robin Swicord and Nicholas Kazan wrote a screenplay adaptation in 1998, with Robin Williams in negotiations for the title role. [23] [24] [25] Williams attended a read-through , which according to Michael Siegel was \"surprisingly disappointing\". [26] Williams' trademark improvisational style clashed with the BFG's unique language. [26] Siegel elaborates, \"He was sort of improvising on the jumbled language. And it was clunky. It was strangely not working. It was harder than it looks even for Robin. It didn't quite deliver.\" [26] By 2001, the script had been rewritten by Gwyn Lurie, and was greeted with positive feedback from the Dahl estate. [27] Terry Jones and Ed Solomon also attempted screenplay drafts. [26] While the screenplay lingered in development hell , Paramount subsequently lost the film rights and they reverted to the Dahl estate. [26]\nIn September 2011, DreamWorks [28] acquired the film rights to the book; Kennedy and Marshall were announced to produce, with screenwriter Melissa Mathison adapting the story. [28] Initially, John Madden was hired to direct; however, in April 2014, Steven Spielberg [29] was announced as the director, with Madden now listed as executive producer with producer Michael Siegel. [30] Kennedy had initially thought of Spielberg as director, but hesitated asking him until a more concrete screenplay was presentable. [31] Spielberg stated, \" The BFG has enchanted families and their children for more than three decades. We are honoured that the Roald Dahl estate has entrusted us with this classic story.\" [32] Walden Media [3] agreed to co-produce and co-finance the film with DreamWorks and Amblin Entertainment in March 2015. [3] A month later, Walt Disney Studios [19] \u2014which was under prior agreement to distribute the film through its Touchstone Pictures banner\u2014also joined the production as a co-producer and co-financier, and shifted the film from a Touchstone release to a Walt Disney Pictures production instead. [29] Consequently, The BFG is the first Disney-branded film directed by Spielberg, though he has previously produced several films for the studio. [33] Similarly, as a result of Amblin Partners ' [10] restructuring, DreamWorks did not receive a marquee credit \u2014placement of the studio's production logo on marketing materials and opening titles\u2014and instead, DreamWorks' marquee credit shifted to Amblin. [34] [35] The film is the second adaptation of the novel following the 1989 direct-to-television animated film . It is also Disney's first feature-length adaptation of a Roald Dahl work since 1996, Henry Selick's James and the Giant Peach .\nMark Rylance was cast as the BFG in October 2014. [17] Spielberg had approached Rylance with the role during the filming of Bridge of Spies . [36] [37] Spielberg was quoted as saying that \"Mark Rylance is a transformational actor. I am excited and thrilled that Mark will be making this journey with us to Giant Country. Everything about his career so far is about making the courageous choice and I'm honoured he has chosen The BFG as his next big screen performance.\" [38] [39] Rylance performed the character through motion capture , a process which he referred to as \"liberating\". [40] In mid-November 2014, it was revealed that a ten-year-old student of Lower Peover School, Ruby Barnhill , had auditioned for the film. She had to learn six pages of dialogue in preparation for a possible role as the orphan Sophie. [41] After a lengthy search, on December 16, Barnhill was cast in the role, about which she said, \"I feel incredibly lucky and I'm so happy.\" Spielberg stated that they \"have discovered a wonderful Sophie in Ruby Barnhill.\" [18] Bill Hader was set to star in the film in an unspecified role on March 27, 2015. [21] On April 13, 2015, the rest of the cast was announced, which included Penelope Wilton , Rebecca Hall , Jemaine Clement , Michael David Adamthwaite , Daniel Bacon, Chris Gibbs, Adam Godley , Jonathan Holmes, Paul Moniz de Sa, and \u00d3lafur \u00d3lafsson . [19]\nPrincipal photography on the film began on March 23, 2015, in Vancouver [19] [42] and concluded on June 12, 2015. [43] Weta Digital worked on the film's visual effects. [44] It is Mathison's final film following her death on November 4, 2015.\nJohn Williams composed and conducted the film's musical score, marking the twenty-seventh collaboration between Spielberg and Williams. [45] Williams was announced as the film's composer in March 2015. [46] During the process of writing the score, Williams compared the film to \"a child's ballet where there are dances involved,\" elaborating, \"The BFG tries to capture dreams with his net and does something that almost looks like a Ray Bolger or Fred Astaire dance; it is an amazingly musical and choreographic sequence which required the orchestra to do things that are more associated with musical films.\" [47] Williams found similarities with the scoring of Home Alone , admitting that writing music for The BFG \"was really an opportunity to compose and orchestrate a little children's fantasy for orchestra.\" [48] The soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on July 1, 2016. [49]\nThe BFG premiered on May 14, 2016, at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival , in an out of competition screening. [50] Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures distributed the film worldwide, except for territories in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, where the film's distribution rights were sold by Amblin's international partner, Mister Smith Entertainment , to independent distributors. [3] [29] [51]\nDisney released a teaser trailer on December 9, 2015. [52] A second trailer was released on April 5, 2016. [53] A third trailer was released on May 16, 2016. [54] The film held its North American premiere at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California on June 21, 2016. [11] It was released in the United States on July 1, 2016. [55] Entertainment One distributed the film in the U.K. on July 22, 2016. [56] DreamWorks' financial partner, Reliance Entertainment , released the film in India on July 29, 2016. [57] Huaxia Film Distribution released the film in China.\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released The BFG on Blu-ray , DVD , and digital download on November 29, 2016. The film debuted in third of the home media sales chart for the week ending on December 2, 2016. [58] Entertainment One and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the UK edition on DVD in 2016.\nThe BFG grossed $55.5 million in North America and $139.7 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $195.2 million, against a production budget of $140 million. [9]\nIn the United States and Canada, The BFG opened alongside The Legend of Tarzan and The Purge: Election Year at 3,357 theaters, and was projected to gross $22\u201332 million in its opening weekend. [59] [60] The film was notably vying for drawing family audiences with the studio's own Finding Dory . [8] It made $775,000 from its Thursday previews; however, the low figure was not surprising, given how family films tend to attract fewer audiences during late-night showings. [61] [62] [63] This was followed by a $7 million opening day (including previews) and a disappointing $18.6 million opening weekend, which Deadline Hollywood called \"an awful start for this film which is estimated to cost $140 million\". [64] [65] Forbes noted that Steven Spielberg's films tend to have long runs, irrespective of their opening numbers. However, it also pointed out that the July 4th weekend proves to be a non-leggy release schedule and most films released during this time end up making only twice their holiday total over the course of their domestic theatrical run. [66] The New York Times called the opening figures \"a colossal misfire\". [67]\nDue to the film's poor performance in North America, the film was considered a box office disappointment . [13] [14] [15] [16] As a result of its low opening numbers in North America, the film needed greater financial success in its international markets, as pointed out by David Hollis, Disney's distribution chief, saying, \"we're going to be reliant in a lot of ways on international [audiences]\". [67] Internationally\u2014during its opening weekend\u2014where the 4th of July weekend is not a holiday, the film opened to $3.9 million in its opening weekend from two markets, Australia and Russia. [68] In Australia, it opened to $2 million placing third while in Russia it debuted second with $1.9 million, which tops the entire runs of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and War Horse . In the United Kingdom, where the book is more well known, it opened to $6.9 million. [69]\nIn China, the release was handled by Huaxia Film Distribution . While it benefitted from a robust marketing effort including Spielberg's presence in the country itself, it suffered from a three month long delay after its North American release. It had an estimated $13.8 million opening, debuting at second place behind Operation Mekong . [70] [71] Many Chinese online reviews criticized Spielberg for making the film \"too juvenile\" for adults. [72]\nThe BFG is one of the lowest-grossing films of Spielberg's career, specifically in North America and, when accounting for inflation, one of the year's biggest flops, but The Hollywood Reporter noted that Disney would be able to withstand the losses due to the success of Captain America: Civil War and Finding Dory . [73] The site also highlighted that the financial losses for Disney could be $90\u2013100 million based on theatrical returns alone. [74]\nOn the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 74% based on 301 reviews and an average rating of 6.70/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \" The BFG minimizes the darker elements of Roald Dahl's classic in favor of a resolutely good-natured, visually stunning, and largely successful family-friendly adventure.\" [75] On another aggregator, Metacritic , the film has a score of 66 out of 100 based on 47 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". [76] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale. [77]\nJustin Chang of Los Angeles Times called Rylance's performance a \"brilliant amalgam of performance-capture technology and peerless screen presence.\" [78] Scott Mendelson of Forbes described the film as \"a charming, intelligent, and witty little adventure movie with strong special effects work in the service of a most unassuming story.\" [79] Mendelson also commended the film's smaller scope in story, as well as Rylance and Barnhill's interaction. [79] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph called the film \"a significant technical accomplishment\", adding that \"the infinitesimally detailed motion-capture technology alone, which stretches Rylance\u2019s human performance to gargantuan proportions, is river-straddling bounds beyond anything that\u2019s come before it.\" [80] Critic Matt Zoller Seitz highly appreciated Spielberg's direction of the film, giving the film three and a half out of four stars. Seitz remarks, \"I can imagine some adults finding the movie dull; 'Nothing happens', they'll say. 'And it's too nice.' But I can imagine other adults loving the film for helping them remember what it's like to be young enough to hide from a movie monster because he's big and weird-looking and then laugh because he's kind of silly...\" [81]\nTodd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter compared the film objectively to Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial , as a \"conspicuously less captivating, magical and transporting experience than its classic forebear.\" [82] Peter Debruge of Variety , however, compared the film favorably to E.T. , writing, \"this splendid Steven Spielberg-directed adaptation makes it possible for audiences of all ages to wrap their heads around one of the unlikeliest friendships in cinema history, resulting in the sort of instant family classic \u201chuman beans\u201d once relied upon Disney to deliver.\" [83] A.

The film stars Mark Rylance , Ruby Barnhill in her film debut, Penelope Wilton , Jemaine Clement , Rebecca Hall , Rafe Spall and Bill Hader . In the film, a 10-year-old orphaned girl named Sophie befriends a benevolent giant dubbed the \"Big Friendly Giant\", who takes her to Giant Country, where they attempt to stop the man-eating giants that are invading the human world. Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall began development on a live-action adaptation of The BFG back in the 1990s, and various screenwriters were hired to work on the screenplay in the subsequent years. DreamWorks acquired the screen rights to Dahl's book in September 2011, and Marshall and Sam Mercer joined as producers, Mathison as screenwriter and Kennedy as executive producer. Spielberg was announced as director in April 2014, alongside his production company Amblin Entertainment as co-producer. Principal photography commenced in March 2015, marking Spielberg's first directorial film for Walt Disney Pictures , which co-financed the film. [10] The BFG premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 14, 2016, and held its North American debut at the El Capitan Theater on June 21, 2016. [11] The film was released in the United States in Disney Digital 3D , RealD 3D , IMAX 3D , [12] and conventional theatrical formats on July 1, 2016, the same year of Dahl's centennial . It received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its visuals, direction, performances and entertainment value. However, the film was a box office bomb , grossing $195 million against its $140 million budget. [13] [14] [15] [16] Sophie, a 10-year-old girl living in a London orphanage, is often awake at the \" witching hour \". One night, she shouts at some men in an alleyway. Later, she sees an elderly Giant Man outside her window, who captures her and takes her to his home in Giant Country. He explains that he cannot allow Sophie to return to her world and reveal the existence of giants. If she ventures out alone, she may be eaten by the nine much larger giants. In his workshop of dreams, the giant fashions a nightmare to convince the sleeping Sophie to stay with him in safety. The Fleshlumpeater, the infantile leader of the man-eating giants, intrudes and demands a \" boo-boo \" on his finger to be fixed. He smells Sophie, but the elderly giant convinces him to leave. Sophie persuades the friendly giant to take her to visit Dream Country. They accidentally awaken the other giants, and after the Bloodbottler suggests they \"frolic\", they bully the friendly giant. A thunderstorm drives the man-eating giants into their cave, but the Fleshlumpeater finds Sophie's dropped blanket. In Dream Country, Sophie and the friendly giant catch good and bad dreams. The giant reveals that his only name \u2013 besides \"Runt\", the other giants' nickname for him \u2013 is \"the Big Friendly Giant\", which leads Sophie to call him \"BFG\". She accompanies him to London for his nightly work: using his dream trumpet to spread good dreams to sleeping children. They return to Giant Country just as the other giants have finished eating children worldwide. The BFG realizes that Sophie has lost her blanket, exposing her presence to the other giants, and leaves her outside her orphanage. Explaining that his last human companion liked to read, and even taught The BFG how to read, but sadly The Boy was discovered and eaten by the giants, he is unwilling to endanger Sophie and departs. Unafraid, Sophie jumps off her balcony in the hope he will appear again to catch her, and he does. They return to the BFG's workshop and the other giants barge in, hunting for Sophie. They destroy much of the BFG's work, but Sophie evades detection and the BFG drives them off with a hot iron. Sophie finds the home of the last human to live with the BFG, with a portrait of Queen Victoria among his belongings. This inspires her to devise a plan: to forge a nightmare for Elizabeth II , the Queen of the United Kingdom , about giants eating the children of England, the British Army fighting the giants, and Sophie appearing to her. Sophie and the BFG go to Buckingham Palace and deliver the nightmare to the sleeping Queen. Upon waking, the Queen and members of her staff Mary and Mr Tibbs find Sophie on the windowsill. She introduces them to the BFG, explaining that the child-eating giants are real and must be stopped. At a large breakfast, the BFG shares his favourite drink, flatulence -inducing \"frobscottle\", and he and Sophie lead the Queen's soldiers to Giant Country. The BFG plans to ambush the man-eating giants with a nightmare but has forgotten his dream trumpet. Sophie carries the nightmare herself into the midst of the giants and is confronted by the Fleshlumpeater. She releases the nightmare which consumes the giants with guilt, except the unregretful Fleshlumpeater (who intercepts and destroys his), and they are trapped by military helicopters. Carried away to an isolated island, the giants are left with only \"snozzcumbers\", a disgusting vegetable, to plant and eat, much to their despair. Sophie gets adopted by Mary, comes to live in the Queen's palace, and awakens from a dream of the BFG, who returns to his life at Giant Country and writes the story of their adventure. She speaks to him whenever she feels lonely; at his home, the BFG hears her words and smiles. Mark Rylance as the Big Friendly Giant (BFG), an elderly, benevolent 24-foot giant . He is called \"Runt\" by the other giants. [17] Ruby Barnhill as Sophie, an orphan who befriends The BFG. [18] Dahl named her after his own mother, who was similarly caring and determined. Jemaine Clement as The Fleshlumpeater, an aquaphobic 54-foot giant who is the de facto leader of the man-eating giants. He shows no regret for consuming children over the years. [19] Rebecca Hall as Mary, Queen Elizabeth's maid and Sophie's mother. [19] Rafe Spall as Mr. Tibbs, Queen Elizabeth's butler. [20] Bill Hader as the Bloodbottler, a disheveled 43-foot man-eating giant with cowlick hair who is Fleshlumpeater's advisor and the most intelligent of the group. [21] Michael Adamthwaite as the Butcher Boy, an overweight, immature man-eating giant who is the youngest of the group. He collects cars and wears clothes made of circus tents. [19] Daniel Bacon as the Bonecruncher, a dark-skinned, bald-headed man-eating giant. As the name suggests, he loves to crunch on the bones of his victims like candy. It's said he can be heard crunching bones for miles. [19] Chris Gibbs as the Gizzardgulper, a burly, bearded 39-foot man-eating giant who wears a helmet and is the shortest of the group. [19] Adam Godley as the Manhugger, a very tall and slim man-eating giant who wears a vest and shorts. He seems to be the laziest of them all. [19] Paul Moniz de Sa as the Meatdripper, a well-groomed man-eating giant with Mohawk hair. He also is the most serious about hunting in the group, clearly more determined than the rest to find Sophie. he doesn't wear a shirt, and has red shorts. [19] Jonathan Holmes as the Childchewer, a balding man-eating giant who is Meatdripper's best friend. He obviously enjoys human child the most out of the giants, and eats only children. [19] \u00d3lafur Darri \u00d3lafsson as the Maidmasher, a small-headed man-eating giant. He has short thin hair, and as the name suggests, likes to smash maidens. Either with his teeth, hands or feet. It is never expanded on. [19] Marilyn Norry as Mrs. Clonkers, the head of the orphanage where Sophie was living. Chris Shields, Matt Frewer , and Geoffrey Wade as The Queen's Generals Adamthwaite, Bacon, Gibbs, Godley, Holmes, Moniz de Sa, and \u00d3lafsson also make cameos as minor London characters. William Samples and Ruby Barnhill's father, Paul Barnhill, make cameos as the palace staff members. Producers Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy began development on a live-action adaptation of The BFG in 1991, and set the project up at Paramount Pictures . [22] Husband and wife screenwriters Robin Swicord and Nicholas Kazan wrote a screenplay adaptation in 1998, with Robin Williams in negotiations for the title role. [23] [24] [25] Williams attended a read-through , which according to Michael Siegel was \"surprisingly disappointing\". [26] Williams' trademark improvisational style clashed with the BFG's unique language. [26] Siegel elaborates, \"He was sort of improvising on the jumbled language. And it was clunky. It was strangely not working. It was harder than it looks even for Robin. It didn't quite deliver.\" [26] By 2001, the script had been rewritten by Gwyn Lurie, and was greeted with positive feedback from the Dahl estate. [27] Terry Jones and Ed Solomon also attempted screenplay drafts. [26] While the screenplay lingered in development hell , Paramount subsequently lost the film rights and they reverted to the Dahl estate. [26] In September 2011, DreamWorks [28] acquired the film rights to the book; Kennedy and Marshall were announced to produce, with screenwriter Melissa Mathison adapting the story. [28] Initially, John Madden was hired to direct; however, in April 2014, Steven Spielberg [29] was announced as the director, with Madden now listed as executive producer with producer Michael Siegel. [30] Kennedy had initially thought of Spielberg as director, but hesitated asking him until a more concrete screenplay was presentable. [31] Spielberg stated, \" The BFG has enchanted families and their children for more than three decades. We are honoured that the Roald Dahl estate has entrusted us with this classic story.\" [32] Walden Media [3] agreed to co-produce and co-finance the film with DreamWorks and Amblin Entertainment in March 2015. [3] A month later, Walt Disney Studios [19] \u2014which was under prior agreement to distribute the film through its Touchstone Pictures banner\u2014also joined the production as a co-producer and co-financier, and shifted the film from a Touchstone release to a Walt Disney Pictures production instead. [29] Consequently, The BFG is the first Disney-branded film directed by Spielberg, though he has previously produced several films for the studio. [33] Similarly, as a result of Amblin Partners ' [10] restructuring, DreamWorks did not receive a marquee credit \u2014placement of the studio's production logo on marketing materials and opening titles\u2014and instead, DreamWorks' marquee credit shifted to Amblin. [34] [35] The film is the second adaptation of the novel following the 1989 direct-to-television animated film . It is also Disney's first feature-length adaptation of a Roald Dahl work since 1996, Henry Selick's James and the Giant Peach . Mark Rylance was cast as the BFG in October 2014. [17] Spielberg had approached Rylance with the role during the filming of Bridge of Spies . [36] [37] Spielberg was quoted as saying that \"Mark Rylance is a transformational actor. I am excited and thrilled that Mark will be making this journey with us to Giant Country. Everything about his career so far is about making the courageous choice and I'm honoured he has chosen The BFG as his next big screen performance.\" [38] [39] Rylance performed the character through motion capture , a process which he referred to as \"liberating\". [40] In mid-November 2014, it was revealed that a ten-year-old student of Lower Peover School, Ruby Barnhill , had auditioned for the film. She had to learn six pages of dialogue in preparation for a possible role as the orphan Sophie. [41] After a lengthy search, on December 16, Barnhill was cast in the role, about which she said, \"I feel incredibly lucky and I'm so happy.\" Spielberg stated that they \"have discovered a wonderful Sophie in Ruby Barnhill.\" [18] Bill Hader was set to star in the film in an unspecified role on March 27, 2015. [21] On April 13, 2015, the rest of the cast was announced, which included Penelope Wilton , Rebecca Hall , Jemaine Clement , Michael David Adamthwaite , Daniel Bacon, Chris Gibbs, Adam Godley , Jonathan Holmes, Paul Moniz de Sa, and \u00d3lafur \u00d3lafsson . [19] Principal photography on the film began on March 23, 2015, in Vancouver [19] [42] and concluded on June 12, 2015. [43] Weta Digital worked on the film's visual effects. [44] It is Mathison's final film following her death on November 4, 2015. John Williams composed and conducted the film's musical score, marking the twenty-seventh collaboration between Spielberg and Williams. [45] Williams was announced as the film's composer in March 2015. [46] During the process of writing the score, Williams compared the film to \"a child's ballet where there are dances involved,\" elaborating, \"The BFG tries to capture dreams with his net and does something that almost looks like a Ray Bolger or Fred Astaire dance; it is an amazingly musical and choreographic sequence which required the orchestra to do things that are more associated with musical films.\" [47] Williams found similarities with the scoring of Home Alone , admitting that writing music for The BFG \"was really an opportunity to compose and orchestrate a little children's fantasy for orchestra.\" [48] The soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on July 1, 2016. [49] The BFG premiered on May 14, 2016, at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival , in an out of competition screening. [50] Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures distributed the film worldwide, except for territories in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, where the film's distribution rights were sold by Amblin's international partner, Mister Smith Entertainment , to independent distributors. [3] [29] [51] Disney released a teaser trailer on December 9, 2015. [52] A second trailer was released on April 5, 2016. [53] A third trailer was released on May 16, 2016. [54] The film held its North American premiere at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California on June 21, 2016. [11] It was released in the United States on July 1, 2016. [55] Entertainment One distributed the film in the U.K. on July 22, 2016. [56] DreamWorks' financial partner, Reliance Entertainment , released the film in India on July 29, 2016. [57] Huaxia Film Distribution released the film in China. Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released The BFG on Blu-ray , DVD , and digital download on November 29, 2016. The film debuted in third of the home media sales chart for the week ending on December 2, 2016. [58] Entertainment One and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the UK edition on DVD in 2016. The BFG grossed $55.5 million in North America and $139.7 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $195.2 million, against a production budget of $140 million. [9] In the United States and Canada, The BFG opened alongside The Legend of Tarzan and The Purge: Election Year at 3,357 theaters, and was projected to gross $22\u201332 million in its opening weekend. [59] [60] The film was notably vying for drawing family audiences with the studio's own Finding Dory . [8] It made $775,000 from its Thursday previews; however, the low figure was not surprising, given how family films tend to attract fewer audiences during late-night showings. [61] [62] [63] This was followed by a $7 million opening day (including previews) and a disappointing $18.6 million opening weekend, which Deadline Hollywood called \"an awful start for this film which is estimated to cost $140 million\". [64] [65] Forbes noted that Steven Spielberg's films tend to have long runs, irrespective of their opening numbers. However, it also pointed out that the July 4th weekend proves to be a non-leggy release schedule and most films released during this time end up making only twice their holiday total over the course of their domestic theatrical run. [66] The New York Times called the opening figures \"a colossal misfire\". [67] Due to the film's poor performance in North America, the film was considered a box office disappointment . [13] [14] [15] [16] As a result of its low opening numbers in North America, the film needed greater financial success in its international markets, as pointed out by David Hollis, Disney's distribution chief, saying, \"we're going to be reliant in a lot of ways on international [audiences]\". [67] Internationally\u2014during its opening weekend\u2014where the 4th of July weekend is not a holiday, the film opened to $3.9 million in its opening weekend from two markets, Australia and Russia. [68] In Australia, it opened to $2 million placing third while in Russia it debuted second with $1.9 million, which tops the entire runs of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and War Horse . In the United Kingdom, where the book is more well known, it opened to $6.9 million. [69] In China, the release was handled by Huaxia Film Distribution . While it benefitted from a robust marketing effort including Spielberg's presence in the country itself, it suffered from a three month long delay after its North American release. It had an estimated $13.8 million opening, debuting at second place behind Operation Mekong . [70] [71] Many Chinese online reviews criticized Spielberg for making the film \"too juvenile\" for adults. [72] The BFG is one of the lowest-grossing films of Spielberg's career, specifically in North America and, when accounting for inflation, one of the year's biggest flops, but The Hollywood Reporter noted that Disney would be able to withstand the losses due to the success of Captain America: Civil War and Finding Dory . [73] The site also highlighted that the financial losses for Disney could be $90\u2013100 million based on theatrical returns alone. [74] On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 74% based on 301 reviews and an average rating of 6.70/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \" The BFG minimizes the darker elements of Roald Dahl's classic in favor of a resolutely good-natured, visually stunning, and largely successful family-friendly adventure.\" [75] On another aggregator, Metacritic , the film has a score of 66 out of 100 based on 47 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". [76] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale. [77] Justin Chang of Los Angeles Times called Rylance's performance a \"brilliant amalgam of performance-capture technology and peerless screen presence.\" [78] Scott Mendelson of Forbes described the film as \"a charming, intelligent, and witty little adventure movie with strong special effects work in the service of a most unassuming story.\" [79] Mendelson also commended the film's smaller scope in story, as well as Rylance and Barnhill's interaction. [79] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph called the film \"a significant technical accomplishment\", adding that \"the infinitesimally detailed motion-capture technology alone, which stretches Rylance\u2019s human performance to gargantuan proportions, is river-straddling bounds beyond anything that\u2019s come before it.\" [80] Critic Matt Zoller Seitz highly appreciated Spielberg's direction of the film, giving the film three and a half out of four stars. Seitz remarks, \"I can imagine some adults finding the movie dull; 'Nothing happens', they'll say. 'And it's too nice.' But I can imagine other adults loving the film for helping them remember what it's like to be young enough to hide from a movie monster because he's big and weird-looking and then laugh because he's kind of silly...\" [81] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter compared the film objectively to Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial , as a \"conspicuously less captivating, magical and transporting experience than its classic forebear.\" [82] Peter Debruge of Variety , however, compared the film favorably to E.T. , writing, \"this splendid Steven Spielberg-directed adaptation makes it possible for audiences of all ages to wrap their heads around one of the unlikeliest friendships in cinema history, resulting in the sort of instant family classic \u201chuman beans\u201d once relied upon Disney to deliver.\" [83] A. O. Scott of The New York Times praised the film's digital effects and visual style as \"exquisite\", though he felt that the film lacked the excitement found in Spielberg's previous fantasy films. [84] Richard Brody of The New Yorker stating that it \"plays like a forced march of fun, a mandatory strain of magic and a prescribed dose of poetry, like a movie ready-made for screening in classrooms when a teacher is absent.\" Brody, however, observes that \"Spielberg is the BFG who's menaced by bigger and more monstrous giants who aren't interested in edifying their audiences but merely in consuming them\u2014consuming the consumer, so to speak.\" [85] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film \"technically impressive but listless and tedious... painfully cutesy, silly and gross rather than whimsical and funny.\" He thought that the film moved far too slowly and was missing a \"sense of wonder and adventure\", saying that he'd \"rather see every one of Spielberg's previous films before having to sit through The BFG again\".

He became the most popular and famous character in the series, and is the titular protagonist in the accompanying television adaptation series Thomas & Friends [2] and its reboot Thomas & Friends: All Engines Go .\nAll of the vehicles in The Railway Series were based on prototypical engines; Thomas's basis is the LB&SCR E2 class . [3] Thomas first appeared in 1946 in the second book in the series, Thomas the Tank Engine , and was the focus of the four short stories contained within. In The Railway Series and early episodes of Thomas & Friends , Thomas's best friends are Percy and Toby , though he is also close friends with Edward . Later episodes of Thomas & Friends have Thomas in a trio with James and Percy, and Percy is known as his best friend.\nIn 1979, British writer and producer Britt Allcroft came across the books, [4] and arranged a deal to bring the stories to life as the TV series Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends (later simplified to Thomas & Friends ). The programme became an award-winning hit around the world, with a vast range of spin-off commercial products.\nWhen Awdry based Thomas on a wooden toy made for his son Christopher . This toy looked rather different from the character in the books and television series, and carried the letters NW on its side tanks, which stood for \"No Where\" according to Awdry. [5]\nThomas wasn't based on a prototype . [6] After Awdry's wife encouraged him to publish the stories, [7] the publisher of the second book in The Railway Series ( Thomas the Tank Engine ) hired illustrator Reginald Payne. Awdry selected a real locomotive for Payne to work from to create authenticity: a Billinton designed 0-6-0 E2 Class of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway. [8] This may have been chosen simply because Awdry had a photograph to hand. [6]\nThe models of Thomas used in the TV series and produced by Hornby are based on the E2 locomotives fitted with an extension to the front of the water tanks. [9] Awdry was unsatisfied with one detail of the illustration \u2014 the front end of his running board sloped downward which meant that his front and back buffers were at different heights. This was an illustrator's mistake that was perpetuated in subsequent books. The accident, in Thomas Comes to Breakfast was partly devised as a means of correcting this. Thomas has always been shown with a curved running board in the television series.\nPayne was not credited for his illustrations at the time, and it is only since the publication of Brian Sibley 's The Thomas the Tank Engine Man that he has received recognition. It had often been erroneously assumed that C. Reginald Dalby created the character, as he was responsible for illustrating books 3\u201311 and repainting the illustrations of books 1 and 2.\nAll of the prototype LB&SCR E2 class locomotives were scrapped between 1961 and 1963. Thomas locomotives used on Day out with Thomas days on heritage railways are either unpowered replicas or converted from other locomotives. [10]\nDespite becoming the most popular character in The Railway Series , Thomas was not featured in the first book, The Three Railway Engines .\nThomas was described in the opening to \"Thomas and Gordon\", the first story in book number two, Thomas the Tank Engine , as: [11]\n...a tank engine who lived at a Big Station. He had six small wheels, a short stumpy funnel, a short stumpy boiler and a short stumpy dome. He was a fussy little engine, always pulling coaches about. [...] He was cheeky, too.\nThomas arrived on Sodor shortly after he was built in 1915, when The Fat Controller bought the locomotive for a nominal sum to be a pilot engine at Vicarstown . Thomas was used initially as a station pilot engine in the first three stories in book 2, but longed for more important jobs such as pulling the express train like Gordon; his inexperience prevented this. In the fourth story, Thomas and the Breakdown Train , Thomas rescues James and is rewarded with his own branch line . [12]\nThomas's on-screen appearances in the TV series were developed by Britt Allcroft . The first series of 26 stories premiered in October 1984 on the ITV Network in the UK, with former Beatles drummer/vocalist Ringo Starr as storyteller. The stories were featured as segments as part of Shining Time Station in the US beginning in 1989 with Starr as the show's Mr. Conductor character. From 1991 to 1993, George Carlin replaced Starr as both the storyteller and as Mr. Conductor for Shining Time Station . Carlin also told the Thomas stories for Shining Time Station in 1995.\nIn 1996, the Thomas stories were segments for Mr. Conductor's Thomas Tales , again featuring George Carlin. Alec Baldwin portrayed Mr. Conductor in the first theatrical film, Thomas and the Magic Railroad (2000), and narrated the series for the US from 1998 to 2003. Michael Angelis narrated the series from 1991 to 2012 in the UK, while Michael Brandon narrated the series from 2004 to 2012 in the US. From 2013 to 2017, the series was narrated by Mark Moraghan until the franchise's upgrade in 2018, when the episodes were told from Thomas's point of view.\nThomas's personality was originally faithful to the character of the books. As the show branched away from the novels however, modifications were made. Thomas became noticeably less arrogant and self-absorbed, developing a more friendly, altruistic and happy go lucky (if still rather over-excitable) side. He also no longer appears to be limited to his branch line and seems to work all over Sodor. These changes in his personality and duties are a result of his \"star\" status. He is the most popular character in the series, and therefore he has the largest number of appearances, appearing in all of the DVD specials and the movie Thomas and the Magic Railroad .\nFrom Hero of the Rails until Series 18, Thomas was voiced by Martin Sherman (US) and Ben Small (UK). [13] From 2015-2021, Thomas was voiced by John Hasler in the UK, and by Joseph May in the US. Both ended their sessions voicing Thomas once the last episode of the 24th and final series was produced, and the role was taken by child actors in Thomas & Friends: All Engines Go , a 2D-animated reboot of the original series; Meesha Contreras voices Thomas in the US version, [1] while Aaron Barashi claims the role in the UK version.\nIn The Adventure Begins which is a retelling of Thomas's early days on Sodor, he is a bluish-green colour when he first arrives on Sodor, his tanks are lettered \"LBSC\" (for the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway) with the number 70 on his bunker. The 70 is a reference to 2015 being the 70th anniversary for The Railway Series , while the LB&SCR E2 class were actually numbered from 100\u2013109. The real life LBSC no. 70 is an A1 class .\nIn late 2020, Mattel revealed that a new theatrical live-action/animated film is in development with Marc Forster directing and producing, it will be the second theatrical Thomas & Friends film in the franchise , after Thomas and the Magic Railroad . It is unknown who will voice Thomas for this production.\n- Eddie Glen ( Thomas and the Magic Railroad )\n- Ben Small ( Hero of the Rails \u2013 Series 18) (UK version)\n- Joseph May ( The Adventure Begins \u2013 Series 24) (US version)\n- Aaron Barashi ( Thomas & Friends: All Engines Go ) (UK version)\n- TBA ( Thomas & Friends: The Movie )\n- Javier Olgu\u00edn ( Hero of the Rails \u2013 Diesel's Ghostly Christmas; Rocky Rescue \u2013 The Great Race ) ( Mexico )\n- Shin Yong-Woo (Series 18 \u2013 Series 19 ) (Korean)\nThomas had his genesis in a wooden push-along toy from the early 1940s made by Wilbert Awdry out of a piece of broomstick for his son Christopher. This engine looked rather different from the character in the books and television series and was based on an LNER Class J50 , which was going to be his originally intended basis, with smaller side tanks and splashers. [14] He was painted blue with yellow lining and carried the letters NW on his side tanks. Christopher lost this model, although it was recreated for the 70th anniversary. However, Awdry was happy to endorse Payne's account that the locomotive was an LBSC E2 , although the first Thomas on the Awdry's model railway, from Stuart Reidpath, lacked extended tanks. In the 1979 Thomas Annual, Awdry wrote: [15]\nI bought Thomas in 1948 when I was writing Tank Engine Thomas Again , and wanted to start modelling once more after a lapse of some twenty years. Thomas was one of Stewart Reidpath's standard models with a heavy, cast white metal body, and was fitted with his \"Essar\" chassis and motor. Stewart Reidpath is now dead, and his motors, let alone spare parts for them, have been unobtainable for years; but Thomas still keeps going! He is, as you might expect from his age, a temperamental old gentleman, and has to be driven very carefully indeed.\nThomas Mk1 was retired with its coaches in 1979, Thomas Mk2 having been produced the year before using a Tri-ang 'Jinty' 3F 0-6-0T. After the British model railways manufacturing company Hornby produced the LBSC E2 tank, Awdry gladly adapted one in 1980 to take the role of Thomas Mk3 on his layout, the Ffarquhar branch.\nAwdry's requested models, to which Lines Bros. subsidiary, Meccano Ltd , responded with Percy and wagons in 1967. [14] Hornby Hobbies launched their 'The World of Thomas the Tank Engine' in the 1985. This was a 00 gauge range of model railway train sets and models which they made for the next 30 years. For Thomas they used their 1979 model of a LB&SCR model of a Class E2 tank engine which they suitably altered with a face and extended tanks to look like Thomas. Many of the characters in the 'Railway Series' books were thus modelled (with faces) by Hornby, including characters added for the television series. They also supplied suitable coaches, wagons and lineside buildings within the series.\nThomas was the only fictional character included in The Independent on Sunday 's 2009 \" Happy List \", recognised alongside 98 real-life adults and a therapy dog for making Britain a better and happier place. [16] In 2011, Thomas the Tank Engine featured on a series of 1st class UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail to mark the centenary of the birth of its creator, Reverend Wilbert Awdry. [17]\nThomas has been referenced, featured and parodied in popular culture. In 1988, he was parodied on ITV 's Spitting Image where he was portrayed as a drunk who went \"completely off the rails.\" [18] In 2009, he appeared in The Official BBC Children in Need Medley where he was voiced by Ringo Starr , who narrated the first two series of Thomas and Friends . [19] In the British comedy show Bobby Davro's TV Weekly , a spoof was created titled \"Thomas The Tanked Up Engine\" involving Jeremy, the pink engine. Bobby Davro provided the narration by impersonating Ringo Starr .\nIn Cartoon Network's MAD , Thomas the Tank Engine appears in \"Thomas the Unstoppable Tank Engine,\" a crossover between Thomas the Tank Engine and Unstoppable . [20] A parody of Thomas the Tank Engine was in Robot Chicken . The skit was called \"Blow Some Steam.\" The narrator ( Seth Green ) spoke like Ringo Starr who was the first narrator for Thomas and Friends . Thomas was voiced by Daniel Radcliffe . [21]\nThe 2015 Marvel superhero film Ant-Man features a Bachmann HO scale model of Thomas. In the film's climactic battle, Ant-Man and Yellowjacket fight atop Thomas while in their insect sizes until Yellowjacket derails Thomas off the model train tracks and throws him at Ant-Man, who knocks him onto a windowsill. An accident during the fight results in Thomas suddenly growing to the size of a real train and demolishing a large portion of Ant-Man's daughter's house before falling on top of a police car. [22] [23] [24]\nVideo game players have frequently modified released games to include Thomas and other characters, typically by replacing a boss character with Thomas and using sounds and music from the show. One of the first popular efforts was replacing dragons with engines and trucks in the game The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim in 2013, and Thomas has since been incorporated into other games like Grand Theft Auto V , Sonic the Hedgehog and the 2019 Resident Evil 2 remake .

In The Adventure Begins which is a retelling of Thomas's early days on Sodor, he is a bluish-green colour when he first arrives on Sodor, his tanks are lettered \"LBSC\" (for the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway) with the number 70 on his bunker. The 70 is a reference to 2015 being the 70th anniversary for The Railway Series , while the LB&SCR E2 class were actually numbered from 100\u2013109. The real life LBSC no. 70 is an A1 class . In late 2020, Mattel revealed that a new theatrical live-action/animated film is in development with Marc Forster directing and producing, it will be the second theatrical Thomas & Friends film in the franchise , after Thomas and the Magic Railroad . It is unknown who will voice Thomas for this production. Eddie Glen ( Thomas and the Magic Railroad ) Ben Small ( Hero of the Rails \u2013 Series 18) (UK version) Joseph May ( The Adventure Begins \u2013 Series 24) (US version) Aaron Barashi ( Thomas & Friends: All Engines Go ) (UK version) TBA ( Thomas & Friends: The Movie ) Javier Olgu\u00edn ( Hero of the Rails \u2013 Diesel's Ghostly Christmas; Rocky Rescue \u2013 The Great Race ) ( Mexico ) Shin Yong-Woo (Series 18 \u2013 Series 19 ) (Korean) Thomas had his genesis in a wooden push-along toy from the early 1940s made by Wilbert Awdry out of a piece of broomstick for his son Christopher. This engine looked rather different from the character in the books and television series and was based on an LNER Class J50 , which was going to be his originally intended basis, with smaller side tanks and splashers. [14] He was painted blue with yellow lining and carried the letters NW on his side tanks. Christopher lost this model, although it was recreated for the 70th anniversary. However, Awdry was happy to endorse Payne's account that the locomotive was an LBSC E2 , although the first Thomas on the Awdry's model railway, from Stuart Reidpath, lacked extended tanks. In the 1979 Thomas Annual, Awdry wrote: [15] I bought Thomas in 1948 when I was writing Tank Engine Thomas Again , and wanted to start modelling once more after a lapse of some twenty years. Thomas was one of Stewart Reidpath's standard models with a heavy, cast white metal body, and was fitted with his \"Essar\" chassis and motor. Stewart Reidpath is now dead, and his motors, let alone spare parts for them, have been unobtainable for years; but Thomas still keeps going! He is, as you might expect from his age, a temperamental old gentleman, and has to be driven very carefully indeed. Thomas Mk1 was retired with its coaches in 1979, Thomas Mk2 having been produced the year before using a Tri-ang 'Jinty' 3F 0-6-0T. After the British model railways manufacturing company Hornby produced the LBSC E2 tank, Awdry gladly adapted one in 1980 to take the role of Thomas Mk3 on his layout, the Ffarquhar branch. Awdry's requested models, to which Lines Bros. subsidiary, Meccano Ltd , responded with Percy and wagons in 1967. [14] Hornby Hobbies launched their 'The World of Thomas the Tank Engine' in the 1985. This was a 00 gauge range of model railway train sets and models which they made for the next 30 years. For Thomas they used their 1979 model of a LB&SCR model of a Class E2 tank engine which they suitably altered with a face and extended tanks to look like Thomas. Many of the characters in the 'Railway Series' books were thus modelled (with faces) by Hornby, including characters added for the television series. They also supplied suitable coaches, wagons and lineside buildings within the series. Thomas was the only fictional character included in The Independent on Sunday 's 2009 \" Happy List \", recognised alongside 98 real-life adults and a therapy dog for making Britain a better and happier place. [16] In 2011, Thomas the Tank Engine featured on a series of 1st class UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail to mark the centenary of the birth of its creator, Reverend Wilbert Awdry. [17] Thomas has been referenced, featured and parodied in popular culture. In 1988, he was parodied on ITV 's Spitting Image where he was portrayed as a drunk who went \"completely off the rails.\" [18] In 2009, he appeared in The Official BBC Children in Need Medley where he was voiced by Ringo Starr , who narrated the first two series of Thomas and Friends . [19] In the British comedy show Bobby Davro's TV Weekly , a spoof was created titled \"Thomas The Tanked Up Engine\" involving Jeremy, the pink engine. Bobby Davro provided the narration by impersonating Ringo Starr . In Cartoon Network's MAD , Thomas the Tank Engine appears in \"Thomas the Unstoppable Tank Engine,\" a crossover between Thomas the Tank Engine and Unstoppable . [20] A parody of Thomas the Tank Engine was in Robot Chicken . The skit was called \"Blow Some Steam.\" The narrator ( Seth Green ) spoke like Ringo Starr who was the first narrator for Thomas and Friends . Thomas was voiced by Daniel Radcliffe . [21] The 2015 Marvel superhero film Ant-Man features a Bachmann HO scale model of Thomas. In the film's climactic battle, Ant-Man and Yellowjacket fight atop Thomas while in their insect sizes until Yellowjacket derails Thomas off the model train tracks and throws him at Ant-Man, who knocks him onto a windowsill. An accident during the fight results in Thomas suddenly growing to the size of a real train and demolishing a large portion of Ant-Man's daughter's house before falling on top of a police car. [22] [23] [24] Video game players have frequently modified released games to include Thomas and other characters, typically by replacing a boss character with Thomas and using sounds and music from the show. One of the first popular efforts was replacing dragons with engines and trucks in the game The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim in 2013, and Thomas has since been incorporated into other games like Grand Theft Auto V , Sonic the Hedgehog and the 2019 Resident Evil 2 remake .

[6] Awdry was educated at Marlborough House School, Hawkhurst, Kent (1919\u20131924), Dauntsey's School , West Lavington, Wiltshire (1924\u20131929), St Peter's Hall, Oxford (BA, 1932), and Wycliffe Hall, Oxford , where he gained his diploma in theology in 1933. He taught for three years from 1933 to 1936 at St George's School, Jerusalem . He was ordained to the Church of England diaconate in 1936 and subsequently the priesthood. In 1938, he married Margaret Emily Wale (1912 \u2013 21 March 1989). In 1940, he took a curacy at St Nicolas Church, Kings Norton , Birmingham , where he lived until 1946. He subsequently moved to Cambridgeshire , serving as rector of Elsworth with Knapwell (1946\u20131950), rural dean at Bourn (1950\u20131953) and then vicar of Emneth , Norfolk (1953\u20131965). [8] He retired from full-time ministry in 1965 and moved to Rodborough in Stroud in Gloucestershire . [9] The characters that would make Awdry known and the first stories featuring them were invented in 1942 to amuse his son Christopher during a bout of measles . After Awdry wrote The Three Railway Engines , he built Christopher a model of Edward , and some wagons and coaches, out of a wooden broomstick and scraps of wood. [10] Christopher also wanted a model of Gordon; however the wartime shortage of materials limited Awdry to making a little 0-6-0 tank engine . Awdry said, \"The natural name was Thomas \u2013 Thomas the Tank Engine.\" [10] Then Christopher requested stories about Thomas and these duly followed and were published in the book Thomas the Tank Engine , published in 1946. The first book, The Three Railway Engines , was published in 1945. Awdry wrote 26 books in The Railway Series , the last in 1972. Christopher subsequently added further books to the series. In 1947, 0-6-0T engine No. 1800 was built by Hudswell Clarke; it spent its working life at the Peterborough -based factory, a property of the British Sugar Corporation, pushing wagons of sugar beet until it was finally replaced by a diesel engine. Peterborough Railway Society purchased the engine in 1973, and this little blue 'Thomas' engine is the star of the Nene Valley Railway . [11] In 1952, Awdry volunteered as a guard on the Talyllyn Railway in Wales , then in its second year of preservation. [12] The railway inspired Awdry to create the Skarloey Railway , based on the Talyllyn, with some of his exploits being written into the stories. [13] Awdry's enthusiasm for railways did not stop at his publications. He was involved in railway preservation, and built model railways , which he took to exhibitions around the country. At Emneth he created an extensive model railway network in his loft based on Barrow-in-Furness. [14] Emneth was also close to three Wisbech railway stations . Emneth railway station was on the EAR line from Magdalen Road Station (now known as Watlington) to Wisbech East, Emneth station is now a private residence. The GER Wisbech and Upwell Tramway tram engines, coaches and rolling stock were similar to Toby the Tram Engine and Henrietta and the Ely to King's Lynn mainline with Wisbech East railway station on Victoria Road. The M&GN Peterborough to Sutton Bridge via Wisbech North railway station on Harecroft Road. There were also harbour lines either side of the Port of Wisbech on the River Nene - M&GN Harbour West branch and GER Harbour East branch. He was a passenger on Alan Pegler 's 1968 non-stop Flying Scotsman London King's Cross to Edinburgh run. Awdry wrote other books besides those of The Railway Series , both fiction and non-fiction. The story Belinda the Beetle was about a red car (it became a Volkswagen Beetle only in the illustrations to the paperback editions). In 1988, his second Ffarquhar model railway layout was shown to the public for the final time and was featured on an ITN News news item. He was again featured on TV-am for Thomas's 40th anniversary in 1990. During all this, Awdry faced many battles \u2013 health problems, depression, and the death of his wife, brother and close friend Teddy Boston . Five years later, he was interviewed by Nicholas Jones for the Bookmark film The Thomas the Tank Engine Man , which first aired on 25 February 1995 and repeated again on 15 April 1997 shortly after his death. Awdry was awarded an OBE in the 1996 New Year's Honours List, but by that time his health had deteriorated and he was unable to travel to London. He died peacefully in his sleep in Stroud , Gloucestershire, on 21 March 1997, at the age of 85. [15] His ashes are interred at Gloucester Crematorium. A biography entitled The Thomas the Tank Engine Man was written by Brian Sibley and published in 1995. A Class 91 locomotive, 91 124, used to bear the name The Rev W Awdry . A Hunslet Austerity 0-6-0ST (saddle tank) engine on the Dean Forest Railway is named Wilbert after him; and was used as the title character in Christopher Awdry's Railway Series book Wilbert the Forest Engine . In 2003, a stained glass window commissioned by the Awdry family was unveiled at St. Edmund's church, Emneth, Norfolk. [16] In 2011, a blue plaque was unveiled by his daughter Veronica Chambers at The Old Vicarage, Emneth where he lived between 1953 and 1965. In 2012 a blue plaque was unveiled at \"Lorne House\", Box, where he lived between 1920 and 1928 when its name was \"Journey's End\". [17] In 2013, Cambridgeshire County Council named their new offices in Wisbech Awdry House in his memory. [18] In 2015, he was rendered in CGI for a special cameo in Sodor's Legend of the Lost Treasure , then later in 2016, he was rendered in CGI again as a cameo in The Great Race . He made frequent appearances ever since, occasionally interacting with the engines, and is referred to by his Railway Series alias, 'The Thin Clergyman'. A pedestrian rail crossing bridge has been dedicated to Awdry in 2017 in the small Hampshire town of Chandlers Ford , which is very close (and has the closest railway line and station) to his birthplace of Ampfield. In 2021, to mark the 75th anniversary of Thomas the Tank Engine, a blue plaque was unveiled at the old Rectory of Holy Trinity Church in Ellsworth, Cambridgeshire. Cambridge Past, Present & Future put up the plaque to mark the books he wrote there. His daughter, Veronica Chambers, said she was \"delighted and moved\". [19] In the second book in the series, Thomas the Tank Engine , Awdry wrote this \"letter\" to his son Christopher: [20] [21] Dear Christopher, Here is your friend Thomas, the Tank Engine. He wanted to come out of his station-yard and see the world. These stories tell you how he did it. I hope you will like them because you helped me to make them. Your Loving Daddy Subsequent books featured a similar letter from the author, addressed to the readers of the book as \"Dear Friends\", which introduced the background to the stories within the book. This text also appears at the beginning of Thomas and Friends episodes from 2004 to 2012. The \"letter\" appears with a storybook showing Thomas on the front cover with \"Thomas the Tank Engine\" at the top and \"By the Rev. W. Awdry\" at the bottom. The book then opens up and we see the letter, read by British actor Nigel Plaskitt , and after the letter is finished a \"steam\" transition appears and it transitions to the Thomas & Friends theme song.

born 2 July 1990) is an Australian actress and producer. Known for her work in both blockbuster and independent films , she has received various awards and nominations , including nominations for two Academy Awards , four Golden Globe Awards , and five British Academy Film Awards . Time magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2017 and she was ranked as one of the world's highest-paid actresses by Forbes in 2019.\nBorn and raised in Queensland , Robbie began her career in 2008 on the television series Neighbours , on which she was a regular until 2011. After moving to America, she led the television series Pan Am (2011\u20132012), and had her breakthrough in 2013 with the black comedy film The Wolf of Wall Street . She achieved wider recognition with starring roles as Jane Porter in The Legend of Tarzan (2016) and Harley Quinn in the DC superhero films, beginning with Suicide Squad (2016).\nRobbie received critical acclaim and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of figure skater Tonya Harding in the biopic I, Tonya (2017). This acclaim continued for her performances as Queen Elizabeth I in Mary Queen of Scots (2018), Sharon Tate in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), and a Fox News employee in Bombshell (2019). She received BAFTA Award nominations for all three and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for the last. Robbie has since starred in the period film Babylon (2022).\nRobbie and her husband, filmmaker Tom Ackerley , co-founded the production company LuckyChap Entertainment , under which they have produced several films, including I, Tonya and Promising Young Woman (2020), as well as the Hulu series Dollface (2019\u20132022) and the Netflix miniseries Maid (2021).\nMargot Elise Robbie was born on 2 July 1990 in Dalby, Queensland , to Doug Robbie, a former farm-owner and sugarcane tycoon , and Sarie Kessler, a physiotherapist . [1] She is the second youngest of four; older siblings Anya and Lachlan and younger brother Cameron. [2] Her parents separated when she was five. [3] Robbie and her siblings were raised by their single mother and had minimal contact with their father. The family spent the majority of Robbie's upbringing on her grandparents' Currumbin Valley farm [4] in the Gold Coast hinterland . [5] An energetic child, Robbie often put on shows in her house. [6]\nShe was enrolled in a circus school by her mother, where she excelled in trapeze , in which she received a certificate at age eight. [7] In high school, Robbie studied drama at Somerset College . [8] As a teenager, she worked three jobs simultaneously: she tended a bar, cleaned houses, and worked at Subway . [9] [10] After graduation, with a few commercials and independent thriller films on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Robbie relocated to Melbourne to begin acting professionally. [11]\nRobbie's first acting roles came when she was in high school. She starred in two low-budget independent thriller films, called Vigilante and I.C.U. , both released years later. She described the experience of being on a film set as \"a dream come true\". [12] She made her television debut in a 2008 guest role as Caitlin Brentford in the drama series City Homicide and followed this with a two-episode arc in the children's television series The Elephant Princess , in which she starred alongside Liam Hemsworth . [13]\nWith agent encouragement at the time and as Robbie recalled on The Graham Norton Show , [14] she called Freemantle Media on a daily basis and this, \"One day, I got put through, by accident to the casting director for Neighbours\" she said, \"I'm in town working on something\". The casting director asked how old she was, \"seventeen\" she fired back! We're looking for exactly that, come in and audition [14] for the television soap opera Neighbours . In June 2008, she began playing Donna Freedman , a role that was meant to be a guest character, but Robbie was promoted to the regular cast after she made her debut. [15] In her three-year stint on the soap, she received two Logie Award nominations. [16]\nShortly after arriving in America, Robbie landed the role of Laura Cameron, a newly trained flight attendant in the period drama series Pan Am (2011). The series premiered to high ratings and positive reviews but was cancelled after one season due to falling ratings. [17] [18]\nRobbie made her feature film debut in Richard Curtis ' romantic comedy About Time (2013), co-starring Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams . It tells the story of a young man with the ability to time travel who tries to change his past in hopes of improving his future. To play Gleeson's unattainable teenage love interest, she adopted a British accent. [19] The film was a modest critical and commercial success, with a reviewer for Variety praising the cast, while also criticising the stock characters as being too familiar. [20] [21]\nRobbie's breakthrough came the same year with the role of Naomi Lapaglia, the wife of protagonist Jordan Belfort in Martin Scorsese 's biographical black comedy The Wolf of Wall Street . Co-starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Belfort, the film recounts his perspective on his career as a stockbroker in New York City and how his firm engaged in rampant corruption and fraud on Wall Street , which led to his downfall. In her audition for the role, Robbie improvised a slap on DiCaprio during a fight scene which ultimately won her the part. [22] The film and her performance received positive reviews; she was particularly praised for her on-screen Brooklyn accent . [23] Critic Sasha Stone wrote of Robbie's performance, \"She's Scorsese's best blonde bombshell discovery since Cathy Moriarty in Raging Bull . Robbie is funny, hard and kills every scene she's in.\" [24] The Wolf of Wall Street was a box office success, grossing $392 million worldwide, making it Scorsese's highest-grossing film to date. [25] Robbie was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance and won the Empire Award for Best Newcomer . [26] She later said that the fame and attention the movie brought her led her to consider quitting acting, but her mother was philosophical about her profession and explained to her, that it was probably too late to quit, she fully understood and stuck with it. [27] With the aim to produce more female-driven projects, Robbie and her future husband Tom Ackerley and their respective longtime friends, Sophia Kerr and Josey McNamara, started their own production company LuckyChap Entertainment . The company was founded in 2014 and its name was inspired by Charlie Chaplin . [3]\nRobbie appeared in four films released in 2015. The first of these was opposite Will Smith in Glenn Ficarra and John Requa 's $158.8 million-grossing romantic comedy-drama film Focus . In the film, she played an inexperienced grifter learning the craft from Smith's character; she learned how to pickpocket from Apollo Robbins for the role. [28] [29] Reviews of the film were generally mixed, but Robbie's performance was praised; Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, \"Robbie is wow and then some. Even when Focus fumbles, [she] deals a winning hand.\" [30] She was nominated for the Rising Star Award at the 68th British Academy Film Awards . [31] Her next appearance was alongside Michelle Williams and Kristin Scott Thomas in Saul Dibb 's war romantic drama Suite Fran\u00e7aise , a film based on the second part of Ir\u00e8ne N\u00e9mirovsky 's 2004 novel of the same name . In the film, she played a woman falling for a German soldier during the German occupation of France during World War II , a role which Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter found \"underwritten\". [32]\nShe followed this with Craig Zobel 's post-apocalyptic drama Z for Zachariah opposite Chris Pine and Chiwetel Ejiofor , in her first leading role. Partially based on Robert C. O'Brien 's book of the same name , the film follows Ann Burden (Robbie) as she finds herself in an emotionally charged love triangle with the last known survivors of a disaster that wipes out most of civilization. In preparation for the film, Robbie dyed her hair brown and learned to speak in an Appalachian accent. [33] The film received positive reviews, and Robbie's performance was widely praised, with Drew McWeeny of HitFix asserting that \"Robbie's work here establishes her as one of the very best actresses in her age range today.\" [34] [35] Her fourth release of 2015 was a cameo appearance in Adam McKay 's comedy-drama The Big Short , in which she breaks the fourth wall to explain subprime mortgages while in a bathtub. The Big Short was a commercial and critical success and Robbie's cameo became a trending topic six years later, in the wake of the GameStop short squeeze , as her explanation provided reference points for what was happening with the GameStop and related stocks. [36]\nIn 2016, Robbie reunited with Ficarra and Requa, playing a British war correspondent in the film adaptation of The Taliban Shuffle called Whiskey Tango Foxtrot , co-starring Tina Fey and Martin Freeman . The comedy-drama was a commercial failure, though it was a modest critical success. [37] [38] Later that year, Robbie took on the part of Jane Porter in David Yates 's adventure film The Legend of Tarzan . She was adamant about not losing weight and ensuring the role was not a damsel in distress like in previous Tarzan adaptations: \"I definitely didn't want her to be a damsel in distress, and I just wanted her to be actively finding a way out of the situation. I didn't want her to be sitting around waiting for someone to come save her but also to be, in the meantime, fixing the problem herself.\" [39] Reviews of the film were generally unfavourable, [40] but Manohla Dargis of The New York Times credited Robbie for \"holding her own\" in her supporting role alongside the all-male cast with Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd and Samuel L. Jackson . Dargis further praised the film by writing, \"What makes it more enjoyable than a lot of recycled stories of this type is that the filmmakers have given Tarzan a thoughtful, imperfect makeover.\" [41]\nRobbie became the first person to portray DC Comics villain Harley Quinn in live-action when she signed on to David Ayer 's 2016 superhero film Suicide Squad alongside an ensemble cast that included Will Smith, Jared Leto and Viola Davis . She admitted to having never read the comics, but felt a huge responsibility to do the character justice and satisfy the fans. [42] Robbie began preparing for the role of the supervillainess six months prior to the film shoot; her schedule consisted of gymnastics , boxing , aerial silk training and learning how to hold her breath underwater for five minutes. She performed the majority of her own stunts in the film. [43] Suicide Squad was a commercial success and was tenth-highest-grossing film of 2016 with global revenues of $746.8 million, and Robbie's performance was considered its prime asset. [44] Writing for Time , Stephanie Zacharek found Robbie to be \"a criminally appealing actress, likable in just about every way\" despite finding flaws in the character [45] and Christopher Orr of The Atlantic called her performance \"genuinely terrific\". [46] At the annual People's Choice Awards ceremony, she won the Favorite Action Movie Actress award and was also awarded the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie . [47] [48] In October 2016, Robbie hosted the season 42 premiere of NBC 's late-night sketch comedy Saturday Night Live ; her appearances included a parody of Ivanka Trump . [49] The series logged its strongest season premiere ratings in eight years. [50] Robbie collaborated with Domhnall Gleeson in Simon Curtis ' Goodbye Christopher Robin (2017), a biographical drama about the lives of Winnie-the-Pooh creator A. A. Milne and his family. The film, and her performance, received modest reviews and was a commercial failure. [51] [52]\nHer final release of 2017 and LuckyChap Entertainment's first release was Craig Gillespie 's sports black comedy I, Tonya , based on the life of American figure skater Tonya Harding (Robbie) and her connection to the 1994 assault on rival Nancy Kerrigan . In preparation, Robbie met with Harding, watched old footage and interviews of her, worked with a voice coach to speak in Harding's Pacific Northwest accent and vocal timbre at different ages, and underwent several months of rigorous skating instruction with choreographer Sarah Kawahara . [53] [54] I, Tonya premiered at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival to critical acclaim. [55] James Luxford of Metro deemed it Robbie's best performance to date, and Mark Kermode of The Observer wrote, \"Like the jaw-dropping triple-axel jump that made champion figure skater Tonya Harding famous, Margot Robbie's performance in this satirical, postmodern tale of the disgraced star is a tour-de-force tornado that balances finely nuanced character development with impressively punchy physicality. [...] Robbie never puts a foot wrong as the proud Portland outsider\". [56] [57] She received numerous accolades for her performance, including nominations for an Academy Award , a BAFTA Award , a Golden Globe Award , a Screen Actors Guild Award and a Critics' Choice Movie Award , all for Best Actress. [58] She became the first actress to receive an Oscar nomination for portraying a real-life Olympic athlete. [59]\nRobbie began 2018 with the voice role of Flopsy Rabbit in Peter Rabbit , a computer-animated comedy from director Will Gluck , which is based on the Beatrix Potter book series . The animated feature was a box office success, grossing $351.3 million worldwide against a production budget of $50 million. [60] Her next two 2018 films\u2014the neo-noir thriller Terminal and comedy-horror Slaughterhouse Rulez \u2014were critical and commercial failures, but Robbie's performance in the former was praised, with Jeffrey M. Anderson of The San Francisco Examiner writing, \"Robbie is a bright one, and even though Terminal isn't much, it offers a chance to watch her shine.\" [61]\nThe historical drama Mary Queen of Scots , directed by Josie Rourke , was her final release of 2018. The film featured Saoirse Ronan as the titular character and Robbie as her cousin Queen Elizabeth I , and it chronicles the 1569 conflict between their two countries . Robbie had initially turned down the role for being \"terrified\" of not living up to the history of portrayals of the Queen. [62] Before each day of shooting, she spent three hours in the make-up chair while a prosthetic nose, painted on boils and blisters were applied. [63] The film premiered at the annual AFI Fest , to mostly mixed reviews; critics dismissed the film for its screenplay and several historical inaccuracies, but praised the performances of Robbie and Ronan and their chemistry. [64] Yolanda Machado of TheWrap wrote, \"[B]ow down to Ronan and Robbie for taking two legendarily complex characters, [...] and completely owning both roles. Ronan's fiery Mary and Robbie's emotionally complex Elizabeth truly reign divine on screen.\" [65] For her portrayal, Robbie received nominations for a BAFTA Award and for a Screen Actors Guild Award . [66]\nRobbie's first release of 2019 was the LuckyChap Entertainment production Dreamland , a poorly received period crime thriller set during the 1930s Dust Bowl . [67] She began executive producing the comedy series Dollface , which aired on Hulu from 2019 to 2022. [68] In the same year, she starred as Sharon Tate alongside Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt in Quentin Tarantino 's comedy-drama Once Upon a Time in Hollywood , with Robbie being Tarantino's only choice to play the late actress. [69] With the Tate-LaBianca Murders serving as a backdrop, the film tells the story of a fading character actor (DiCaprio) and his stunt double (Pitt) as they navigate New Hollywood in 1969 Los Angeles. [70] Feeling \"an enormous sense of responsibility\", Robbie prepared for the role by meeting Tate's family members and friends, watching all of her films and reading the autobiography by Tate's then-husband, Roman Polanski . [71] Once Upon a Time in Hollywood premiered at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival to critical acclaim, and was a commercial success with a worldwide gross of $374.3 million. [72] Despite many criticising Robbie's lack of lines in the film, [73] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph highlighted a scene with Robbie in the cinema, which he found to be the film's \"most delightful\" scene. [74]\nAlso in 2019, she starred as Kayla Pospisil, a composite character based on several Fox News employees, in Jay Roach 's drama Bombshell . Co-starring Charlize Theron and Nicole Kidman , the film recounts stories of various female personnel at the news network and their reports of sexual harassment by the network's chairman Roger Ailes . [75] Robbie based her character's accent on Katherine Harris . [76] The film received positive reviews; [77] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Robbie [is] at her best, the arc of her story is so crushing that it stays with you the longest.\" [78] For her performances in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Bombshell , she received double nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture , and for the latter she received nominations for an Academy Award , a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award; all in the Best Supporting Actress category. [79]\nRobbie began the new decade by reprising the role of Harley Quinn in Cathy Yan 's Birds of Prey . Determined to make a female ensemble action film, she pitched the idea for the film to Warner Bros. in 2015. Robbie spent the subsequent three years developing the project under her production company, making a concerted effort to hire a female director and screenwriter. [80] Birds of Prey , along with Robbie's performance, gained generally positive reviews; [81] [82] [83] Ian Freer of Empire wrote that \"the MVP is Robbie, who lends Harley charming quirk and believable menace, hinting at Harley's inner life without reams of dialogue.\" [84] She received two nominations at the 46th People's Choice Awards . [85]\nRobbie served as a producer on Promising Young Woman (2020), a comedy thriller by writer-director Emerald Fennell . It starred Carey Mulligan as a woman who seeks to avenge the death of her best friend, who was a victim of rape. The film premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival to critical acclaim, [86] [87] later receiving a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture . [88] In 2021, Robbie reprised her voice role as Flopsy Rabbit in Will Gluck's Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway , released a year later due to the COVID-19 pandemic . The film received mixed reviews and grossed $153.8 million worldwide. [89] [90] She also made her third outing as Harley Quinn in the standalone sequel to Suicide Squad , called The Suicide Squad , written and directed by James Gunn . Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film was simultaneously released theatrically and on the streaming service HBO Max . Owen Gleiberman praised Robbie's \"delectable performance\" in it. [91] In the same year, she served as an executive producer for the Netflix miniseries Maid . [92]\nIn 2022, Robbie reprised her role as Donna Freedman for the final episode of Neighbours . [93] She starred alongside an ensemble cast in David O. Russell 's period comedy Amsterdam , based on the 1933 Business Plot . [94] The film emerged as a critical and commercial failure. [95] [96] In her second film release of the year, she played Nellie LaRoy, an actress inspired by silent movie star Clara Bow , in Damien Chazelle 's comedy-drama Babylon . In preparation, she studied the works of Bow and researched her traumatic childhood. [27] She described LaRoy as \"the most physically and emotionally draining character I\u2019ve ever played\". [27] The film polarized critics, though her performance received praise; [97] Caryn James of BBC Culture opined, \"Robbie's bold, charismatic performance makes Nellie a daring, endlessly spiralling, sympathetic figure\". [98] She received another Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. [99]\nRobbie will next portray the titular fashion doll in Greta Gerwig 's 2023 film Barbie opposite Ryan Gosling , [100] and join the ensemble cast of Wes Anderson 's film Asteroid City . [101]\nRobbie moved from Melbourne to Williamsburg, Brooklyn in the early 2010s. [102] During that period, she became an avid ice hockey fan, supporting the New York Rangers , and playing right wing in an amateur ice hockey league. [103] [104] Despite significant media attention, Robbie rarely discusses her personal life. [105] [106]\nRobbie met British assistant director Tom Ackerley on the set of Suite Fran\u00e7aise in 2013. [107] In 2014, she moved to London with Ackerley and LuckyChap Entertainment co-founders Sophia Kerr and Josey McNamara. Later that year, Robbie and Ackerley began a romantic relationship. [3] [108] They married in December 2016 in Australia [109] and reside in Venice Beach, California . [107]\nRobbie is an outspoken fan of heavy metal music and cites Slipknot , Bullet for My Valentine , Silverstein , Metallica , Kiss , and Aerosmith as some of her favourite bands. [110] [111]\nRobbie has been a vocal supporter of human rights , women's rights , gender equality and LGBT rights. Through LuckyChap Entertainment, she and her co-founders focus on promoting female stories from female storytellers, whether it would be writers, directors, producers or all the above. [112] In 2014, she was part of a fundraising event in support of the Motion Picture & Television Fund , which helps people in the film and television industries with limited or no resources; she joined the same event on two other occasions, in 2018 and 2020. [113] In 2015, she helped raise $12 million through the BGC Global Charity Day fundraising event, which donates money to different charities around the world.

[116]\nIn October 2016, while hosting Saturday Night Live , Robbie made a stand for same-sex marriage in her native Australia wearing a T-shirt that read \"Say 'I Do' Down Under\", with a map of the country in rainbow colours. A year later, she joined fellow actor Chris Hemsworth in advocating for the same purpose. [117] In 2018, she pledged to support the Time's Up initiative to protect women from harassment and discrimination. [118] In April 2021, Robbie was announced as the recipient of the inaugural RAD Impact Award, for inspiring purpose with her philanthropy. She chose to share the prize with Youngcare , a charity she had previously worked with, and therefore an impact donation was made to fund a project benefiting young people with extensive care needs. [119]\nRobbie is known for starring in both high-profile, mainstream productions and low-budget independent films, in which she has been able to display both her dramatic and comedic range. [120] [121] [122] [123] [124]\nFor her role in The Wolf of Wall Street , Vanity Fair named her one of its breakthrough actors of 2013. [125] In 2017, she appeared on the annual Forbes 30 Under 30 list, a compilation of the brightest young entrepreneurs, innovators and game changers in the world and was included on a similar list compiled by The Hollywood Reporter . [126] [127] That same year, Time named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world ; her The Wolf of Wall Street director Martin Scorsese penned the article in the magazine, referring to Robbie as having \"a unique audacity that surprises and challenges and just burns like a brand into every character she plays. [...] Margot is stunning in all she is and all she does, and she will astonish us forever.\" [128] In 2019, Forbes ranked her among the world's highest-paid actresses, with annual earnings of $23.5 million, and The Hollywood Reporter listed her among the 100 most powerful people in entertainment. [129] [130] In 2021, she was named one of the 100 most influential women in entertainment by The Hollywood Reporter .

[132] [133] In 2014 and 2016, she featured on AskMen 's Top 99 Women, ranking among the top ten each year. [134] [135] Also in 2016, Robbie was placed at number one on FHM ' s \" 100 Sexiest Women in the World \" list. [136] Since 2016, she has been chosen as the ambassador for brands such as Calvin Klein , Nissan and Chanel . [137] She was the last brand ambassador picked by Karl Lagerfeld before his death in February 2019. [138]\nAccording to the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes , Robbie's most critically acclaimed films are About Time (2013), The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), Z for Zachariah (2015), Suite Fran\u00e7aise (2015), Whiskey Tango Foxtrot (2016), I, Tonya (2017), Mary Queen of Scots (2019), Bombshell (2019), Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), Birds of Prey (2020), and The Suicide Squad (2021).

Known for her work in both blockbuster and independent films , she has received various awards and nominations , including nominations for two Academy Awards , four Golden Globe Awards , and five British Academy Film Awards . Time magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2017 and she was ranked as one of the world's highest-paid actresses by Forbes in 2019. Born and raised in Queensland , Robbie began her career in 2008 on the television series Neighbours , on which she was a regular until 2011. After moving to America, she led the television series Pan Am (2011\u20132012), and had her breakthrough in 2013 with the black comedy film The Wolf of Wall Street . She achieved wider recognition with starring roles as Jane Porter in The Legend of Tarzan (2016) and Harley Quinn in the DC superhero films, beginning with Suicide Squad (2016). Robbie received critical acclaim and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of figure skater Tonya Harding in the biopic I, Tonya (2017). This acclaim continued for her performances as Queen Elizabeth I in Mary Queen of Scots (2018), Sharon Tate in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), and a Fox News employee in Bombshell (2019). She received BAFTA Award nominations for all three and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for the last. Robbie has since starred in the period film Babylon (2022). Robbie and her husband, filmmaker Tom Ackerley , co-founded the production company LuckyChap Entertainment , under which they have produced several films, including I, Tonya and Promising Young Woman (2020), as well as the Hulu series Dollface (2019\u20132022) and the Netflix miniseries Maid (2021). Margot Elise Robbie was born on 2 July 1990 in Dalby, Queensland , to Doug Robbie, a former farm-owner and sugarcane tycoon , and Sarie Kessler, a physiotherapist . [1] She is the second youngest of four; older siblings Anya and Lachlan and younger brother Cameron. [2] Her parents separated when she was five. [3] Robbie and her siblings were raised by their single mother and had minimal contact with their father. The family spent the majority of Robbie's upbringing on her grandparents' Currumbin Valley farm [4] in the Gold Coast hinterland . [5] An energetic child, Robbie often put on shows in her house. [6] She was enrolled in a circus school by her mother, where she excelled in trapeze , in which she received a certificate at age eight. [7] In high school, Robbie studied drama at Somerset College . [8] As a teenager, she worked three jobs simultaneously: she tended a bar, cleaned houses, and worked at Subway . [9] [10] After graduation, with a few commercials and independent thriller films on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Robbie relocated to Melbourne to begin acting professionally. [11] Robbie's first acting roles came when she was in high school. She starred in two low-budget independent thriller films, called Vigilante and I.C.U. , both released years later. She described the experience of being on a film set as \"a dream come true\". [12] She made her television debut in a 2008 guest role as Caitlin Brentford in the drama series City Homicide and followed this with a two-episode arc in the children's television series The Elephant Princess , in which she starred alongside Liam Hemsworth . [13] With agent encouragement at the time and as Robbie recalled on The Graham Norton Show , [14] she called Freemantle Media on a daily basis and this, \"One day, I got put through, by accident to the casting director for Neighbours\" she said, \"I'm in town working on something\". The casting director asked how old she was, \"seventeen\" she fired back! We're looking for exactly that, come in and audition [14] for the television soap opera Neighbours . In June 2008, she began playing Donna Freedman , a role that was meant to be a guest character, but Robbie was promoted to the regular cast after she made her debut. [15] In her three-year stint on the soap, she received two Logie Award nominations. [16] Shortly after arriving in America, Robbie landed the role of Laura Cameron, a newly trained flight attendant in the period drama series Pan Am (2011). The series premiered to high ratings and positive reviews but was cancelled after one season due to falling ratings. [17] [18] Robbie made her feature film debut in Richard Curtis ' romantic comedy About Time (2013), co-starring Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams . It tells the story of a young man with the ability to time travel who tries to change his past in hopes of improving his future. To play Gleeson's unattainable teenage love interest, she adopted a British accent. [19] The film was a modest critical and commercial success, with a reviewer for Variety praising the cast, while also criticising the stock characters as being too familiar. [20] [21] Robbie's breakthrough came the same year with the role of Naomi Lapaglia, the wife of protagonist Jordan Belfort in Martin Scorsese 's biographical black comedy The Wolf of Wall Street . Co-starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Belfort, the film recounts his perspective on his career as a stockbroker in New York City and how his firm engaged in rampant corruption and fraud on Wall Street , which led to his downfall. In her audition for the role, Robbie improvised a slap on DiCaprio during a fight scene which ultimately won her the part. [22] The film and her performance received positive reviews; she was particularly praised for her on-screen Brooklyn accent . [23] Critic Sasha Stone wrote of Robbie's performance, \"She's Scorsese's best blonde bombshell discovery since Cathy Moriarty in Raging Bull . Robbie is funny, hard and kills every scene she's in.\" [24] The Wolf of Wall Street was a box office success, grossing $392 million worldwide, making it Scorsese's highest-grossing film to date. [25] Robbie was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance and won the Empire Award for Best Newcomer . [26] She later said that the fame and attention the movie brought her led her to consider quitting acting, but her mother was philosophical about her profession and explained to her, that it was probably too late to quit, she fully understood and stuck with it. [27] With the aim to produce more female-driven projects, Robbie and her future husband Tom Ackerley and their respective longtime friends, Sophia Kerr and Josey McNamara, started their own production company LuckyChap Entertainment . The company was founded in 2014 and its name was inspired by Charlie Chaplin . [3] Robbie appeared in four films released in 2015. The first of these was opposite Will Smith in Glenn Ficarra and John Requa 's $158.8 million-grossing romantic comedy-drama film Focus . In the film, she played an inexperienced grifter learning the craft from Smith's character; she learned how to pickpocket from Apollo Robbins for the role. [28] [29] Reviews of the film were generally mixed, but Robbie's performance was praised; Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, \"Robbie is wow and then some. Even when Focus fumbles, [she] deals a winning hand.\" [30] She was nominated for the Rising Star Award at the 68th British Academy Film Awards . [31] Her next appearance was alongside Michelle Williams and Kristin Scott Thomas in Saul Dibb 's war romantic drama Suite Fran\u00e7aise , a film based on the second part of Ir\u00e8ne N\u00e9mirovsky 's 2004 novel of the same name . In the film, she played a woman falling for a German soldier during the German occupation of France during World War II , a role which Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter found \"underwritten\". [32] She followed this with Craig Zobel 's post-apocalyptic drama Z for Zachariah opposite Chris Pine and Chiwetel Ejiofor , in her first leading role. Partially based on Robert C. O'Brien 's book of the same name , the film follows Ann Burden (Robbie) as she finds herself in an emotionally charged love triangle with the last known survivors of a disaster that wipes out most of civilization. In preparation for the film, Robbie dyed her hair brown and learned to speak in an Appalachian accent. [33] The film received positive reviews, and Robbie's performance was widely praised, with Drew McWeeny of HitFix asserting that \"Robbie's work here establishes her as one of the very best actresses in her age range today.\" [34] [35] Her fourth release of 2015 was a cameo appearance in Adam McKay 's comedy-drama The Big Short , in which she breaks the fourth wall to explain subprime mortgages while in a bathtub. The Big Short was a commercial and critical success and Robbie's cameo became a trending topic six years later, in the wake of the GameStop short squeeze , as her explanation provided reference points for what was happening with the GameStop and related stocks. [36] In 2016, Robbie reunited with Ficarra and Requa, playing a British war correspondent in the film adaptation of The Taliban Shuffle called Whiskey Tango Foxtrot , co-starring Tina Fey and Martin Freeman . The comedy-drama was a commercial failure, though it was a modest critical success. [37] [38] Later that year, Robbie took on the part of Jane Porter in David Yates 's adventure film The Legend of Tarzan . She was adamant about not losing weight and ensuring the role was not a damsel in distress like in previous Tarzan adaptations: \"I definitely didn't want her to be a damsel in distress, and I just wanted her to be actively finding a way out of the situation. I didn't want her to be sitting around waiting for someone to come save her but also to be, in the meantime, fixing the problem herself.\" [39] Reviews of the film were generally unfavourable, [40] but Manohla Dargis of The New York Times credited Robbie for \"holding her own\" in her supporting role alongside the all-male cast with Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd and Samuel L. Jackson . Dargis further praised the film by writing, \"What makes it more enjoyable than a lot of recycled stories of this type is that the filmmakers have given Tarzan a thoughtful, imperfect makeover.\" [41] Robbie became the first person to portray DC Comics villain Harley Quinn in live-action when she signed on to David Ayer 's 2016 superhero film Suicide Squad alongside an ensemble cast that included Will Smith, Jared Leto and Viola Davis . She admitted to having never read the comics, but felt a huge responsibility to do the character justice and satisfy the fans. [42] Robbie began preparing for the role of the supervillainess six months prior to the film shoot; her schedule consisted of gymnastics , boxing , aerial silk training and learning how to hold her breath underwater for five minutes. She performed the majority of her own stunts in the film. [43] Suicide Squad was a commercial success and was tenth-highest-grossing film of 2016 with global revenues of $746.8 million, and Robbie's performance was considered its prime asset. [44] Writing for Time , Stephanie Zacharek found Robbie to be \"a criminally appealing actress, likable in just about every way\" despite finding flaws in the character [45] and Christopher Orr of The Atlantic called her performance \"genuinely terrific\". [46] At the annual People's Choice Awards ceremony, she won the Favorite Action Movie Actress award and was also awarded the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie . [47] [48] In October 2016, Robbie hosted the season 42 premiere of NBC 's late-night sketch comedy Saturday Night Live ; her appearances included a parody of Ivanka Trump . [49] The series logged its strongest season premiere ratings in eight years. [50] Robbie collaborated with Domhnall Gleeson in Simon Curtis ' Goodbye Christopher Robin (2017), a biographical drama about the lives of Winnie-the-Pooh creator A. A. Milne and his family. The film, and her performance, received modest reviews and was a commercial failure. [51] [52] Her final release of 2017 and LuckyChap Entertainment's first release was Craig Gillespie 's sports black comedy I, Tonya , based on the life of American figure skater Tonya Harding (Robbie) and her connection to the 1994 assault on rival Nancy Kerrigan . In preparation, Robbie met with Harding, watched old footage and interviews of her, worked with a voice coach to speak in Harding's Pacific Northwest accent and vocal timbre at different ages, and underwent several months of rigorous skating instruction with choreographer Sarah Kawahara . [53] [54] I, Tonya premiered at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival to critical acclaim. [55] James Luxford of Metro deemed it Robbie's best performance to date, and Mark Kermode of The Observer wrote, \"Like the jaw-dropping triple-axel jump that made champion figure skater Tonya Harding famous, Margot Robbie's performance in this satirical, postmodern tale of the disgraced star is a tour-de-force tornado that balances finely nuanced character development with impressively punchy physicality. [...] Robbie never puts a foot wrong as the proud Portland outsider\". [56] [57] She received numerous accolades for her performance, including nominations for an Academy Award , a BAFTA Award , a Golden Globe Award , a Screen Actors Guild Award and a Critics' Choice Movie Award , all for Best Actress. [58] She became the first actress to receive an Oscar nomination for portraying a real-life Olympic athlete. [59] Robbie began 2018 with the voice role of Flopsy Rabbit in Peter Rabbit , a computer-animated comedy from director Will Gluck , which is based on the Beatrix Potter book series . The animated feature was a box office success, grossing $351.3 million worldwide against a production budget of $50 million. [60] Her next two 2018 films\u2014the neo-noir thriller Terminal and comedy-horror Slaughterhouse Rulez \u2014were critical and commercial failures, but Robbie's performance in the former was praised, with Jeffrey M. Anderson of The San Francisco Examiner writing, \"Robbie is a bright one, and even though Terminal isn't much, it offers a chance to watch her shine.\" [61] The historical drama Mary Queen of Scots , directed by Josie Rourke , was her final release of 2018. The film featured Saoirse Ronan as the titular character and Robbie as her cousin Queen Elizabeth I , and it chronicles the 1569 conflict between their two countries . Robbie had initially turned down the role for being \"terrified\" of not living up to the history of portrayals of the Queen. [62] Before each day of shooting, she spent three hours in the make-up chair while a prosthetic nose, painted on boils and blisters were applied. [63] The film premiered at the annual AFI Fest , to mostly mixed reviews; critics dismissed the film for its screenplay and several historical inaccuracies, but praised the performances of Robbie and Ronan and their chemistry. [64] Yolanda Machado of TheWrap wrote, \"[B]ow down to Ronan and Robbie for taking two legendarily complex characters, [...] and completely owning both roles. Ronan's fiery Mary and Robbie's emotionally complex Elizabeth truly reign divine on screen.\" [65] For her portrayal, Robbie received nominations for a BAFTA Award and for a Screen Actors Guild Award . [66] Robbie's first release of 2019 was the LuckyChap Entertainment production Dreamland , a poorly received period crime thriller set during the 1930s Dust Bowl . [67] She began executive producing the comedy series Dollface , which aired on Hulu from 2019 to 2022. [68] In the same year, she starred as Sharon Tate alongside Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt in Quentin Tarantino 's comedy-drama Once Upon a Time in Hollywood , with Robbie being Tarantino's only choice to play the late actress. [69] With the Tate-LaBianca Murders serving as a backdrop, the film tells the story of a fading character actor (DiCaprio) and his stunt double (Pitt) as they navigate New Hollywood in 1969 Los Angeles. [70] Feeling \"an enormous sense of responsibility\", Robbie prepared for the role by meeting Tate's family members and friends, watching all of her films and reading the autobiography by Tate's then-husband, Roman Polanski . [71] Once Upon a Time in Hollywood premiered at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival to critical acclaim, and was a commercial success with a worldwide gross of $374.3 million. [72] Despite many criticising Robbie's lack of lines in the film, [73] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph highlighted a scene with Robbie in the cinema, which he found to be the film's \"most delightful\" scene. [74] Also in 2019, she starred as Kayla Pospisil, a composite character based on several Fox News employees, in Jay Roach 's drama Bombshell . Co-starring Charlize Theron and Nicole Kidman , the film recounts stories of various female personnel at the news network and their reports of sexual harassment by the network's chairman Roger Ailes . [75] Robbie based her character's accent on Katherine Harris . [76] The film received positive reviews; [77] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Robbie [is] at her best, the arc of her story is so crushing that it stays with you the longest.\" [78] For her performances in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Bombshell , she received double nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture , and for the latter she received nominations for an Academy Award , a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award; all in the Best Supporting Actress category. [79] Robbie began the new decade by reprising the role of Harley Quinn in Cathy Yan 's Birds of Prey . Determined to make a female ensemble action film, she pitched the idea for the film to Warner Bros. in 2015. Robbie spent the subsequent three years developing the project under her production company, making a concerted effort to hire a female director and screenwriter. [80] Birds of Prey , along with Robbie's performance, gained generally positive reviews; [81] [82] [83] Ian Freer of Empire wrote that \"the MVP is Robbie, who lends Harley charming quirk and believable menace, hinting at Harley's inner life without reams of dialogue.\" [84] She received two nominations at the 46th People's Choice Awards . [85] Robbie served as a producer on Promising Young Woman (2020), a comedy thriller by writer-director Emerald Fennell . It starred Carey Mulligan as a woman who seeks to avenge the death of her best friend, who was a victim of rape. The film premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival to critical acclaim, [86] [87] later receiving a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture . [88] In 2021, Robbie reprised her voice role as Flopsy Rabbit in Will Gluck's Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway , released a year later due to the COVID-19 pandemic . The film received mixed reviews and grossed $153.8 million worldwide. [89] [90] She also made her third outing as Harley Quinn in the standalone sequel to Suicide Squad , called The Suicide Squad , written and directed by James Gunn . Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film was simultaneously released theatrically and on the streaming service HBO Max . Owen Gleiberman praised Robbie's \"delectable performance\" in it. [91] In the same year, she served as an executive producer for the Netflix miniseries Maid . [92] In 2022, Robbie reprised her role as Donna Freedman for the final episode of Neighbours . [93] She starred alongside an ensemble cast in David O. Russell 's period comedy Amsterdam , based on the 1933 Business Plot . [94] The film emerged as a critical and commercial failure. [95] [96] In her second film release of the year, she played Nellie LaRoy, an actress inspired by silent movie star Clara Bow , in Damien Chazelle 's comedy-drama Babylon . In preparation, she studied the works of Bow and researched her traumatic childhood. [27] She described LaRoy as \"the most physically and emotionally draining character I\u2019ve ever played\". [27] The film polarized critics, though her performance received praise; [97] Caryn James of BBC Culture opined, \"Robbie's bold, charismatic performance makes Nellie a daring, endlessly spiralling, sympathetic figure\". [98] She received another Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. [99] Robbie will next portray the titular fashion doll in Greta Gerwig 's 2023 film Barbie opposite Ryan Gosling , [100] and join the ensemble cast of Wes Anderson 's film Asteroid City . [101] Robbie moved from Melbourne to Williamsburg, Brooklyn in the early 2010s. [102] During that period, she became an avid ice hockey fan, supporting the New York Rangers , and playing right wing in an amateur ice hockey league. [103] [104] Despite significant media attention, Robbie rarely discusses her personal life. [105] [106] Robbie met British assistant director Tom Ackerley on the set of Suite Fran\u00e7aise in 2013. [107] In 2014, she moved to London with Ackerley and LuckyChap Entertainment co-founders Sophia Kerr and Josey McNamara. Later that year, Robbie and Ackerley began a romantic relationship. [3] [108] They married in December 2016 in Australia [109] and reside in Venice Beach, California . [107] Robbie is an outspoken fan of heavy metal music and cites Slipknot , Bullet for My Valentine , Silverstein , Metallica , Kiss , and Aerosmith as some of her favourite bands. [110] [111] Robbie has been a vocal supporter of human rights , women's rights , gender equality and LGBT rights. Through LuckyChap Entertainment, she and her co-founders focus on promoting female stories from female storytellers, whether it would be writers, directors, producers or all the above. [112] In 2014, she was part of a fundraising event in support of the Motion Picture & Television Fund , which helps people in the film and television industries with limited or no resources; she joined the same event on two other occasions, in 2018 and 2020. [113] In 2015, she helped raise $12 million through the BGC Global Charity Day fundraising event, which donates money to different charities around the world. [114] In 2016, Robbie joined other celebrities and UN Refugee Agency staff in a petition aiming to gather public support for the growing number of families forced to flee conflict and persecution worldwide. [115] Later in the year, she joined Oxfam 's \"I Hear You\" project, which was designed to amplify the personal stories of the world's most vulnerable refugees and donated more than $50.000 to UNICEF 's \"Children First\" campaign, in support of refugee children. [116] In October 2016, while hosting Saturday Night Live , Robbie made a stand for same-sex marriage in her native Australia wearing a T-shirt that read \"Say 'I Do' Down Under\", with a map of the country in rainbow colours. A year later, she joined fellow actor Chris Hemsworth in advocating for the same purpose. [117] In 2018, she pledged to support the Time's Up initiative to protect women from harassment and discrimination. [118] In April 2021, Robbie was announced as the recipient of the inaugural RAD Impact Award, for inspiring purpose with her philanthropy. She chose to share the prize with Youngcare , a charity she had previously worked with, and therefore an impact donation was made to fund a project benefiting young people with extensive care needs. [119] Robbie is known for starring in both high-profile, mainstream productions and low-budget independent films, in which she has been able to display both her dramatic and comedic range. [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] For her role in The Wolf of Wall Street , Vanity Fair named her one of its breakthrough actors of 2013. [125] In 2017, she appeared on the annual Forbes 30 Under 30 list, a compilation of the brightest young entrepreneurs, innovators and game changers in the world and was included on a similar list compiled by The Hollywood Reporter . [126] [127] That same year, Time named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world ; her The Wolf of Wall Street director Martin Scorsese penned the article in the magazine, referring to Robbie as having \"a unique audacity that surprises and challenges and just burns like a brand into every character she plays. [...] Margot is stunning in all she is and all she does, and she will astonish us forever.\" [128] In 2019, Forbes ranked her among the world's highest-paid actresses, with annual earnings of $23.5 million, and The Hollywood Reporter listed her among the 100 most powerful people in entertainment. [129] [130] In 2021, she was named one of the 100 most influential women in entertainment by The Hollywood Reporter .

[132] [133] In 2014 and 2016, she featured on AskMen 's Top 99 Women, ranking among the top ten each year. [134] [135] Also in 2016, Robbie was placed at number one on FHM ' s \" 100 Sexiest Women in the World \" list. [136] Since 2016, she has been chosen as the ambassador for brands such as Calvin Klein , Nissan and Chanel . [137] She was the last brand ambassador picked by Karl Lagerfeld before his death in February 2019. [138] According to the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes , Robbie's most critically acclaimed films are About Time (2013), The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), Z for Zachariah (2015), Suite Fran\u00e7aise (2015), Whiskey Tango Foxtrot (2016), I, Tonya (2017), Mary Queen of Scots (2019), Bombshell (2019), Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), Birds of Prey (2020), and The Suicide Squad (2021).

Strong even cosplayed as Harley at San Diego Comic-Con in 2016. Strong has longstanding ties to the DC Universe, having voiced Batgirl in various projects from 1997 to 2016. In the game, her version of Harley Quinn was equipped with both a mallet and a handgun, and (unlike the heroes in \"Lego Batman\") could open doors. DeLisle has also played Selina Kyle/Catwoman and Wonder Woman in other DC media over the years. Harley Quinn briefly appeared in the 2017 motion comic series, \"Batman: Black and White,\" to protest that she and the Joker were innocent during her time as a prisoner in Arkham Asylum. Jaud also played Catwoman in the series. Strange's Harley was a 1920s flapper who appeared in one episode of \"Batman: The Brave and the Bold.\" In the episode, Harley appeared to help Joker rob Gotham's Museum of Comedy. Bailey took over the role from Grey DeLisle, voicing her in both the Lego Batman videogame sequel, \"Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes,\" and the 2013 movie \"Lego Batman: The Movie \u2014 DC Super Heroes Unite.\" Her Harley has the ability to use her mallet as a boomerang. In a 2017 anime-style Justice League movie, \"DC Super Heroes vs. Eagle Talon,\" South Korean actress Kang Ji Young voiced Harley Quinn. In doing so, she became the first and only woman of color to have played the character in her nearly 30-year existence. Batman and Harley Quinn reluctantly team up in the 2017 animated film, \"Batman and Harley Quinn,\" and viewers might recognize the voice behind the antiheroine \u2014 she's played by Melissa Rauch , who was Bernadette Rostenkowski in \" The Big Bang Theory .\" \"I love that Harley is a badass and, beyond that, that she uses her humor as another weapon in her arsenal,\" Rauch told Empire Magazine . \"She knows just how to diffuse a situation with her humor, and how to incite a situation with her sarcasm. It's a dream role.\" Harley Quinn was introduced in the second episode of Telltale Games' Batman series: \"Batman: The Enemy Within.\" Post's version of the character has black diamonds painted over her eyes and is more of an independent mobster than the Joker's confidant. The former \"Saturday Night Live\" star is no stranger to voice work, having appeared in movies like \"The Secret Life of Pets\" and \"Zootopia.\" Known for playing characters like Lady Fish and Mom in \"Spongebob Squarepants,\" Irwin played the character as the professional psychiatrist she was before joining the Joker. In \"Batman vs. Two-Face,\" Dr. Harleen Quinzel becomes involved when Gotham District Attorney Harvey Dent is accidentally transformed into the villain Two-Face during a laboratory accident. Her name might sound similar to \"Birds of Prey\" actress, Margot Robbie, but voice actress Margot Rubin took over Jenny Slate's Lego Harley Quinn role in \"The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part.\" In a reference to \"Suicide Squad,\" Quinn tells main character Emmett (Chris Pratt) that his plan to rescue his girlfriend is a \"suicide mission.\" Rauch isn't the only \"Big Bang Theory\" actress to play Harley Quinn. In 2019, Kaley Cuoco (who played Penny on the popular CBS show) voiced the titular character in Adult Swim's 2019 \"Harley Quinn\" adult animated web series. \"I've perfected certain looks and facial expressions over the years, so this [role] in a way was harder \u2014 also because I'm voicing someone as iconic as Harley,\" Cuoco said in an interview with Digital Spy . Robbie has arguably become the most recognizable Harley Quinn actress, largely because she was the first to play her in a live-action movie (2016's \"Suicide Squad\"). The actress became very involved with the character's future in the current DC cinematic universe, pitching a Harley \"girl gang\" movie that grew into this year's \"Birds of Prey.\" In the film, she teams up with several female superheroes to take down a Gotham crime lord . \"While I was researching Harley, I was devouring the comics. I became kind of obsessed with them at some point,\" Robbie said in an interview with Variety . \"Harley has this unpredictable nature that means she could react in any way to any situation, which as an actor is just a gift. Between all those things, I really just fell in love with her.\" Read next", "documentFile": "https://www.insider.com/every-actress-who-played-voiced-harley-quinn-movie-tv-shows-2020-1"}],
