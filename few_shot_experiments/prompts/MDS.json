During her stay, she did ceramics, crocheted, taught yoga, became an expert on vending-machine snacks, and foraged the grounds for fresh greens for the prison salads. She was incarcerated after being convicted in March for lying about a stock sale. She was grateful for the support of her friends, family, colleagues, and fans. Stewart became a prison reform advocate through her experience. Her presence in the Prison has brought many reporters and tourists to town of Alderson, helping its economy. She emerged from the Alderson prison on March 6 with head held high, 20 pounds lighter and a lot wealthier, since shares in her company nearly tripled in value. Following her release, Stewart is planned to host a daily live-audience program on NBC beginning this fall. The show is scheduled to begin once Stewart's five months of house arrest end.",

The domestic diva's family shouldn't count on eating with Stewart, however. In years past, Thanksgiving was the one day of the year when inmates' families were allowed past visiting rooms and into the heart of the camp where, for $1.75, they could share in the feast. Not this year. Zobel said the decision to limit the meal to inmates was a \"procedural change\" announced in August by the camp's new warden and was driven partly by budgetary concerns.

The sales, she said, will make this a nice Thanksgiving indeed for her family. \"We're in rural West Virginia.

Doing time -- or what her friends call \"the intermission\" -- has breathed new life into the company's shares. Some investors and analysts believe the shares are now over-priced and could fall back to earth soon after the interest in Stewart's post-prison status fades. The stock closed Wednesday at $28.31, down 2.1 percent from the previous day, after the company announced plans to shutter its catalog and online divisions in February. Still, the shares are way up from their lows of about $8.50 just before her sentencing last July. Whether American consumers view her as a more sympathetic person, or are just curious what she'll be like after prison, doesn't seem to matter to marketing experts, some of whom think she will be able to take advantage of the renewed interest either way. Her life inside the prison -- with its predawn wakeup calls, unappealing food and suffering fellow inmates -- has been sufficiently chronicled so that the 63-year-old Stewart seems more a sympathetic character than a frosty prima donna concerned only about her own agenda. \"If she gets behind prison reform, then she becomes Saint Martha,\" said Hayes Roth, a brand consultant with Landor Associates in New York. \"It would be great for the brand and great for Martha. If she gets back to running the basics of the business and has this added patina, if you will, of having suffered and moved ahead in her life -- well, Americans love that.\"",

The specter of a civil suit (separate and different from the criminal for which she went to prison) filed by the SEC hovers, though it's been reported that negotiations are under way for a settlement that would allow Stewart to reclaim her CEO status in five years. (Stewart relinquished the title amid the controversy, and law prohibits her from regaining control of the company.) She has a new boss in CEO Susan Lyne, who's used to working for high-profile personalities (Rupert Murdoch, Michael Eisner) and has been a calm voice of reasoned support during the hoopla. After her house-arrest term expires, Stewart will be on probation for two more years. Stewart won't be allowed to fraternize with other felons, meaning the friends she made in prison are off limits.

Obesity among children has tripled itself in the last 30-40 years. Obesity increases the risk for type 2 diabetes. Bray believes that environmental factors have more to do with obesity than genetics. He suggests that childhood obesity can be prevented by getting more sleep, decreasing sedentary activities, drinking more milk (calcium controls weight), thinking portion control and eating breakfast. An Institute of Medicine report found compelling evidence encouraging the food industry to change the nature of foods being marketed to children. Former US president Bill Clinton announced a 10-year initiative to combat childhood obesity, and also participated in an obesity-battling campaign invloving several cartoon characters. Clinton's involvement comes from his own health-related experience.",

Environment is very important.\" Bray says the problem with HFCS is not only that it is sweeter than other forms of sugar, but also that it does not affect appetite. Fructose adds to overeating because it does not trigger chemical messengers that tell the brain the stomach is full and no longer hungry, like food and drinks that contain regular refined sugar do. An internist whose pioneering research helped establish the connections between weight gain and the development of type 2 diabetes, Bray is a research professor and former director of the Pennington Center at Louisiana State University, the largest nutritional research center in the world. He says consumers would be a lot better off without added sugar in any form, but that artificial sweeteners are much preferred over calorically sweetened drinks, even for children. \"Children less than 5 probably shouldn't have any sweetened drinks, and for older children, diet drinks are better than regular soft drinks and fruit drinks,\" Bray said. \"A lot of parents are concerned about the 'chemicals' added to sweeten diet soft drinks, but all forms of extra added sugar and artificial sweeteners are bad. We don't need added sugar in our diet.\" Bray says parents should be in charge of diets, children should be in charge of their own exercise activities, and perhaps government should regulate portion sizes. Kids should be required to be active a certain amount of time each day, but after you tell them to turn off the TV and get moving, you should let them decide if they want to go outside and play with friends, ride bikes, swim, play ball, skate, play tennis, go shopping or whatever, as long as they are moving. When parents require children to \"work out\" or \"exercise,\" the children are more likely to stop moving altogether as soon as they get away from home, Bray says. He is calling for improved packaging and labeling for food meant to be consumed as a single serving. Too many ready-to-eat foods and drinks are labeled as single servings but packaged as two or even three servings. \"It's hard to find a single-serving soft drink,\" he said. \"Portion size is something government (BEGIN BRACKET)the Food and Drug Administration(END BRACKET) can and should do something about.\" (Carolyn Poirot, cpoirotstar-telegram.com.

The findings were no surprise to Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, who requested the report. \"We like to think that SpongeBob SquarePants and Shrek and the pretty little princesses are likable, kid-friendly characters, but they're being used to manipulate vulnerable children to make unhealthy choices,\" said Harkin, the senior Democrat on the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee. \"The industry must stop pushing junk food on our kids,\" Harkin said. Nickelodeon in October announced a campaign aimed at persuading kids to eat healthy foods and to get up off the couch and move. {HS}The campaign features former President Bill Clinton and the cartoon characters{HE} SpongeBob SquarePants and Dora the Explorer. {HS}Among children and adolescents from ages 6 through 19, obesity rates have tripled over the past 40 years.{HE} {HS}Obesity increases the risks of type 2 diabetes{HE}"
