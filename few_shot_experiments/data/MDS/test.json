Kavanaugh is appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday as senators continue publicly interviewing President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court.\nKavanaugh, a member of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has a good chance of being confirmed when the Senate votes later this month. Under questioning from senators, he has so far touched on Roe v. Wade, said courts - not the president - are \"the final word\" and, as the hearing began, watched drama unfold regarding Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.)'s pledge to release confidential documents.\nKey moments from the hearing:\n  Drama over confidential emails....that were already cleared for public release\n  Kavanaugh advised against calling Roe \"settled law\"\n  Kavanaugh elaborates on dissent on contraception and religious objections\n  Emails show more involvement with nominee than Kavanaugh previously suggested\n10:13 p.m.: Hearing adjourned\nMore than 12 hours after the questioning began Thursday morning, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) adjourned the confirmation hearing for the day. Grassley closed the session by praising Kavanaugh for his \"compelling and credible\" answers, highlighted his history on the bench and said that \"unquestionably, you're qualified to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States.\"\n\"I hope a lot of people in this country have formed very positive views of you, as I have,\" Grassley said.\nKavanaugh spent nearly 24 hours over two days answering questions, with many of the discussions on Thursday centering in some way or another on President Trump, who nominated Kavanaugh to the high court. Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, including some Republicans, pressed Kavanaugh about his expansive views of presidential power and past writings that concluded civil suits and criminal investigations of presidents would be better delayed until the chief executive left office.

Kavanaugh's tenure in the George W. Bush White House spotlighted the simmering frustrations from Democrats over how Republicans have kept secret vast parts of Kavanaugh's voluminous paper trail.\nTens of thousands of pages from Kavanaugh's records have been hidden from public view, only available to senators and certain congressional aides in advance of Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings this week.\nOn Thursday, a small sample of the \"committee confidential\" documents were disclosed after Democratic senators asked that they be approved for public release, raising questions about why the documents had been considered confidential in the first place.\nRead more here.\n7:30 p.m.: Pressed on gay rights, Kavanaugh declines to say same-sex marriage ruling was correctly decided\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) pressed Kavanaugh for the first time Thursday night about gay rights. The judge refused to answer whether the high court's ruling declaring a constitutional right for same-sex couples to marry was correctly decided.\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy, the man Kavanaugh would replace on the bench, cast the deciding vote in the case, Obergefell v. Hodges.\nKavanaugh instead read aloud from another Kennedy ruling this year involving gay rights in which the justice wrote that gay people \"cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth.\"\nHarris noted that Kavanaugh earlier this week characterized the landmark decision declaring segregated schools unconstitutional as a great moment in history, and asked whether the high court's decision legalizing gay marriage was a similar moment.\nThe judge said only that it was precedent.\nThe White House sent out information on Kavanaugh's record on gay rights soon after the exchange, noting that Kavanaugh has not had a major case involving gay rights in his 12 years on the D.C. Circuit.\n\"Kavanaugh rules fairly and impartially based on the law, not the identity of the parties before him, and he has a record of faithfully applying legal protections for racial minorities, women, and other protected groups,\"the White House statement said.\n- Ann E. Marimow\n7:11 p.m.: Kavanaugh, pressed again, said he has not discussed the Mueller probe\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who late Wednesday asked Kavanaugh if he had discussed special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election with attorneys at the law firm founded by President Trump's personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, questioned him again Thursday.\nPicking up a line of inquiry that her colleagues, including Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), had followed during the day, Harris peppered him with follow-up questions. Noting that he had denied having \"inappropriate\" conversations about it, Harris asking Kavanaugh if he had discussions regarding the special counsel's probe and whether he had discussed it with anyone at Kasowitz's firm, saying she had unspecified \"reliable information\" he had done the latter. (The firm denied this earlier in the day).\nKavanaugh asked Harris if she was asking whether he spoke to anyone specific about it, but she said that was not the question.\n\"That is not the subject of the question, sir,\" she said. \"The subject of the question is you and whether you were part of a conversation regarding special counsel Mueller's investigation.\"\nKavanaugh, nearly a day after their exchange late Wednesday, responded: \"The answer's no.\"\nHarris replied by thanking him and saying \"it would have been great if you could've said that last night,\" prompting Kavanaugh to begin a reply before cutting him off.\n\"Let's move on,\" Harris said.\nThe end of the exchange prompted a rare reaction from White House counsel Donald McGahn, who has largely kept his poker face during the hearings while seated behind Kavanaugh in clear view of the cameras. After Harris's remark about moving on, McGahn gave a slight shake of his head and briefly arched his eyebrows.\n- Mark Berman\n6:52 p.m.: Booker asks why Kavanaugh won't recuse himself from the Mueller probe\nHours after Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) took center stage with drama over some of the documents the committee had, he had a chance to speak to Kavanaugh, pressing the judge on a variation of a question he had been asked previously during the hearings: Why not recuse himself from any court matters that would involve the ongoing special counsel probe because, as Booker said, \"it's really important that the Supreme Court be above suspicion\"?\nKavanaugh responded by saying doing so would mean showing he did not have judicial independence.\n\"All I would be doing is demonstrating that I don't have the independence of the judiciary ... that is necessary to be a good judge,\" Kavanaugh responded. \"All of the nominees who've gone before have declined to commit because that would be inconsistent with judicial independence.\"\n- Seung Min Kim\n5:50 p.m.: Hearing pauses for dinner\nThe hearing was halted until 6:15 p.m. for a dinner break. After that, four senators will get their turns to question Kavanaugh before the committee opens up a new round of questioning.\n5:15 p.m.: Kavanaugh declines to condemn Trump's attacks on judiciary\nKavanaugh refused to repudiate what Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) described as President Trump's \"blatant, craven and repeated attacks\" on the federal judiciary.\nBlumenthal was referring to Trump's criticism that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg \"has embarrassed us all\" and \"her mind is shot.\" Ginsburg had been critical of Trump, prompting him to make the comments on Twitter during the 2016 presidential campaign.\nKavanaugh took a pass, saying he did not want to \"get within three Zip codes\" of such a political controversy.\nBlumemthal noted that the president's first Supreme Court pick, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, explicitly condemned Trump's attacks as \"disheartening\" and \"demoralizing.\" Gorsuch spoke generally, but his comments came after the president had criticized the ethnic background of Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who ruled against the administration's travel ban.\nSen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) followed up, suggesting that the judge was resisting any criticism of President Trump.\nKavanaugh disagreed. As a judge, he said, \"We stay out of politics, we don't comment on comments made by politicians.\"\n- Ann E. Marimow\n5:08 p.m.: Blumenthal presses Kavanaugh on Mueller probe\nThe ongoing special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election took center stage at the hearing again Thursday afternoon - this time, in a line of questioning from Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).\nFollowing questions on Wednesday night and again Thursday morning, Kavanaugh was again pressed about special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's probe, which could eventually make its way before a Supreme Court featuring Kavanaugh as a member.\nBlumenthal asked Kavanaugh if he had ever discussed the investigation with anyone, and Kavanaugh echoed his earlier remark in saying: \"I've had no inappropriate discussions with anyone.\"\nBlumenthal followed that by asking if the judge had ever discussed the investigation with anyone, whether appropriately or inappropriately. Kavanaugh acknowledged that it had come up - \"If you're walking around in America it's coming up, senator\" - but he also repeatedly emphasized that he never crossed any lines in discussing it.\n\"I've never suggested anything about my views about anything, commitments, foreshadowing, I've had no inappropriate discussions,\" he said.\nBlumenthal then pivoted to asking if Kavanaugh had discussed it with anyone in the White House, including Donald McGahn, the White House counsel seated behind Kavanaugh during the hearings. When Blumenthal asked Kavanaugh if he had discussed the probe with McGahn or anyone else in the White House, calling it a yes or no question, Kavanaugh said: \"I'm not remembering any discussions like that.\"\nHe added, though, that during his preparations for the confirmation hearings, he had readied for queries like the ones Blumenthal had posed. The questioning grew mildly tense, with Blumenthal suggesting that Kavanaugh's answers were ambiguous, which the judge disputed.\nAfter Blumenthal finished his questioning, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) broke in to ask Kavanaugh if he had ever suggested to anyone how he would rule on any matter related to the Mueller probe, and the judge answered: \"No, I have not.\"\nBlumenthal followed up his questions about the probe by asking whether Kavanaugh had discussed the inquiry with anyone at the law firm founded by President Trump's personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz.\nEarlier on Thursday, the firm Kasowitz Benson Torres said in a statement that \"no discussions\" regarding the probe had occurred \"between Judge Kavanaugh and anyone at our firm.\"\nWhen asked by Blumenthal, Kavanaugh echoed his earlier comments that he did not remember any discussions with anyone at the firm about the probe. When asked if he knew Kasowitz, Kavanaugh said no.\nWhen asked if he knew anyone at the firm, Kavanaugh said yes, naming Ed McNally, who used to work at the White House counsel's office and is now at the firm. Kavanaugh said he had not discussed the special counsel's probe with McNally.\n- Mark Berman\n3:35 p.m.: Kavanaugh tries to clarify involvement in judge's confirmation\nKavanaugh on Thursday discussed his involvement in the confirmation of now-Judge William H. Pryor Jr. to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit - clarifying his testimony from 2004 when he said he hadn't handled that nomination when he served as an associate White House counsel.\nThe nominee's comments came after the new disclosure of emails earlier Thursday that detailed what appeared to be Kavanaugh's involvement in Pryor's confirmation fight, including conference calls to coordinate strategy and meetings to discuss plans for the nominee's hearings.\nKavanaugh explained Thursday that in the George W. Bush White House counsel's office, one person would be assigned to handle the confirmation of each judicial nominee. \"As I recall at least, I was not the primary person on that,\" Kavanaugh said, referring to Pryor's nomination.\nWhile Kavanaugh said he didn't recall specifics of his involvement, some examples he cited were attendance at meetings and mock hearing sessions.\nIn 2004, during his confirmation hearing for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Kavanaugh said several times under questioning by then-Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) that he had not been involved with Pryor's confirmation.\n\"I am familiar generally with Mr. Pryor, but that was not one that I worked on personally,\" Kavanaugh testified then, although he noted during the hearing that he knew Pryor. Upon further questioning, Kavanaugh said: \"I was not involved in handling his nomination.\"\nKavanaugh, with the help of Grassley, clarified another one of the emails involving Pryor. On Dec. 16, 2002, Kavanaugh received an email from another White House aide with the subject line \"CA11\" - a reference to the 11th Circuit. The aide, Kyle Sampson, asked: \"How did the Pryor interview go?\" Kavanaugh then responded: \"Call me.\"\nGrassley, noting that Democrats attempted to \"insinuate that you interviewed Judge Pryor,\" asked Kavanaugh: It's \"more likely to indicate that you know the people who interviewed Judge Pryor?\"\nKavanaugh responded: \"That sounds correct.\"\n- Seung Min Kim\n2:56 p.m.: Kavanaugh elaborates on dissent on contraception and religious objections\nAdvocates for reproductive rights are concerned about the contraceptive-coverage requirement in the Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare. In a 2015 case, Kavanaugh dissented from his colleagues and sided with the group Priests for Life, which argued that a provision in the law to opt out for religious objections was too burdensome.\nKavanaugh elaborated Thursday on the basis for his dissent, telling Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) that \"the government had ways to ensure contraceptive coverage without doing so on the backs of religious objectors.\"\nThe issue remains in court after the Trump administration issued new rules making it easier for employers to refuse to provide coverage for birth control on the basis of religious objections.\nCruz also asked the judge about a case on which he worked as a lawyer in private practice in which he backed a high school's decision to allow student-led prayers over the public address system at football games. He argued that students were delivering their own messages, not speaking on behalf of the school. The Supreme Court disagreed, finding the policy unconstitutional.\n\"Religious people, speakers and speech are entitled to equal treatment,\" Kavanaugh said Thursday.\n- Ann E. Marimow\n2:41 p.m.: Kasowitz firm denies discussing special counsel probe with Kavanaugh\nIn one of the most widely noticed parts of the hearings, Kavanaugh was questioned late Wednesday by Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) about whether he had discussed special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election with attorneys at the law firm founded by President Trump's personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz.\nOn Thursday, Kavanaugh was asked again about this by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), who gave the judge an opportunity to clarify his responses to Harris. Kavanaugh said he did not \"recall any conversations of that kind,\" adding that he was not familiar with the names of all of the attorneys from the firm Kasowitz Benson Torres.\nKavanaugh said he had not had any \"inappropriate conversations\" or commented on his views about the legal aspects of the probe, elements of which could potentially make it to the Supreme Court.\nOn Thursday, the Kasowitz firm also said that no one there had discussed the probe with Kavanaugh.\n\"There have been no discussions regarding Robert Mueller's investigation between Judge Kavanaugh and anyone at our firm,\" the law firm said in a statement.\n- Mark Berman\n1:57 p.m.: Hearings resume after lunch break\nAfter pausing for lunch, the hearings are getting back underway. The first hours brought an extended drama over documents as well as questions about abortion, executive power and the special counsel's probe, with extensive questioning still expected for the remainder of the day.\n1:38 p.m.: The drama over 'confidential' emails - which were already cleared for public release\nDemocrats mounted dramatic protests Thursday over documents related to Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh's tenure in the George W. Bush White House, as senators began releasing his emails that had been withheld from the public.\nThe records that Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) posted on their websites Thursday morning had, in fact, already been cleared for public release, according to Democratic and Republican aides on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Those documents were cleared earlier Thursday morning, according to spokesmen for both sides.\nNevertheless, the drama over the emails once marked \"committee confidential\" engulfed much of the third day of Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, with Booker vowing to disclose them in defiance of Senate rules.\n\"I openly invite and accept the consequences of releasing that email right now,\" Booker said. \"The emails are being withheld from the public have nothing to do with national security.\"\nBill Burck, Bush's presidential records representative, said later Thursday, \"We cleared the documents last night shortly after Senator Booker's staff asked us to. We were surprised to learn about Senator Booker's histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly. In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public.\"\nSuch theatrics have characterized Kavanaugh's hearings, in which Democrats have repeatedly complained that Republicans have withheld documents from the committee and the public that shed important light on Kavanaugh's past.\nThe documents that took center stage on Thursday were labeled \"committee confidential\" - available for any senators to view but shielded from the public.\nLate Wednesday, a handful of Democratic senators sent Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) several requests to make emails once marked \"committee confidential\" available to the public so they could discuss them during the public hearing on Thursday. Those records are being cleared as the Justice Department reviews them, as well as representatives for Bush.\nBooker may have violated Senate rules late Wednesday, when he spoke about the content of emails that technically were still under \"committee confidential\" status at that point.\n\"You've also written that an effort designed to benefit minority-owned businesses, an effort to try to give them a fair shake because they had been historically excluded - and these are your words now - used a lot of legalisms and disguises to mask what is, in reality, a naked racial set-aside. That's what you said. That's how you referred to it,\" Booker said, referring to one of the emails from Kavanaugh.\nLater in his questioning, Booker referred again to the committee confidential emails: \"I have letters here, sir, that have asked for - now, the one email specifically entitled racial profiling that somehow - I mean, literally the email was entitled racial profiling, that somehow was designated as something that the public couldn't see. This wasn't - this wasn't personal information.\"\nReleasing \"committee confidential\" information violates Senate rules and could result in expulsion from the Senate. But whether the Senate actually pursues the violation is a separate question.\n- Seung Min Kim\n1:17 p.m.: Hearing pauses for lunch\nGrassley paused the hearing for a lunch break, which he said would take 30 minutes but potentially longer, noting that senators have two votes scheduled this afternoon.\n1:10 p.m.: Court orders, not the president, are \"the final word,\" Kavanaugh says\nSenate Democrats raised concerns Thursday about the president's attacks this week on the Justice Department and Kavanaugh's broad view of executive power expressed in his legal opinions and speeches. In a tweet on Monday, Trump criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for the recent indictments of two Republican congressmen, the latest in a string of criticisms the president has levied against both Sessions and the department he leads.\n\"In this age of President Donald Trump, this expansive view of presidential power takes on added significance,\" said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).\nKavanaugh emphasized the importance of the separation of powers and an independent judiciary as a backstop.\n\"I've made clear in my writings that a court order that requires a president to do something or prohibits president from doing something is the final word in our system,\" Kavanaugh said.\n- Ann E. Marimow\n12:32 p.m.: Hearing resumes\nAfter a 15-minute break that lasted for about 25 minutes, Kavanaugh has taken his seat again to answer questions.\n12 p.m.: Read Kavanaugh's email on Roe v. Wade\nIn an email Kavanaugh wrote in 2003 that was made public Thursday, he argued against calling the decision \"settled law of the land.\"\nIn his email, Kavanaugh wrote that he was \"not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe\" that way, noting that the Supreme Court \"can always overrule its precedent.\"\nWhen asked about the email by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) on Thursday, Kavanaugh said he was not expressing his own views, but rather those of \"legal scholars.\"\nRead his email here. And head here for more on what else he has said on the issue.\n- Mark Berman\n11:27 a.m.: Kavanaugh denies any \"inappropriate conversations\" about special counsel probe\nLate Wednesday night, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) questioned Kavanaugh about whether he had discussed the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election with attorneys at the law firm founded by President Trump's personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz.\nThe exchange drew intense scrutiny online, and on Thursday, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) gave Kavanaugh an opportunity to clarify his responses to Harris, who did not disclose with whom she suspected the judge may have had such conversations.\n\"I don't recall any conversations of that kind,\" Kavanaugh told Hatch, adding that he was not familiar with the names of all of the attorneys from the firm Kasowitz Benson Torres.\nKavanaugh stressed that he had not had any \"inappropriate conversations\" or commented on his views about the legal aspects of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation that could make their way to the Supreme Court.\n\"No hints, forecasts, previews, winks - nothing about my view as a judge or how I would rule on that or anything related to that,\" Kavanaugh said.\n- Ann E. Marimow\n11:20 a.m.: Emails show more involvement with controversial judicial nominee than Kavanaugh previously suggested\nKavanaugh testified in 2004 that he did not \"personally\" handle the nomination of a controversial George W. Bush judicial candidate: Judge William Pryor, who now sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. But emails made newly public early Thursday show more involvement than he appeared to indicate in his 2004 testimony.\nOn Dec. 16, 2002, Kavanaugh received an email, reviewed by The Washington Post, from another White House aide with the subject line \"CA11\" - a reference to the 11th Circuit. The aide, Kyle Sampson, asked: \"How did the Pryor interview go?\" Kavanaugh then responded: \"Call me.\"\nAnother email from June 5, 2003 reviewed by The Post showed Kavanaugh on an email chain with a handful of other officials, alerting them to a 4 p.m. conference call to \"discuss Pryor and coordinate plans and efforts.\" A separate email earlier that day, on which Kavanaugh was blind carbon copied, discussed a meeting that would be held the following day to \"discuss nominee Bill Pryor's hearing\" the following week.\nKavanaugh was nominated by Bush on April 9, 2003, and his confirmation hearing was held June 11, 2003. He was confirmed in 2005.\nIn 2004 during his confirmation hearing for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Kavanaugh said several times under questioning by then-Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) that he had not been involved with Pryor's confirmation.\n\"I am familiar generally with Mr. Pryor, but that was not one that I worked on personally,\" Kavanaugh testified then. Upon further questioning, Kavanaugh said \"I was not involved in handling his nomination.\"\nPryor drew controversy because he had called Roe v. Wade \"the worst abomination of constitutional law in our history.\" As attorney general of Alabama, he had filed an amicus brief in a key Supreme Court case on gay rights, Lawrence v. Texas, that struck down state sodomy laws. Pryor wrote that states should \"remain free to protect the moral standards of their communities through legislation that prohibits homosexual sodomy.\"\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), one of the swing votes on Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court, voted against Pryor's confirmation in 2005.\nWhite House spokesman Raj Shah did not immediately return a request for comment on the newly disclosed Pryor emails.\nA spokesman for the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), said some previously \"committee confidential\" documents are being made public as they are cleared by the Justice Department. Other records that have been requested to be made public are still being reviewed by DOJ and representatives for Bush.\n- Seung Min Kim\n11:01 a.m.: Kavanaugh advised against calling Roe \"settled law,\" email shows\nWhile he was a White House lawyer in the Bush administration, Kavanaugh advised against referring to the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade as the \"settled law of the land,\" according to a 2003 email made public Thursday.\n\"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so,\" Kavanaugh wrote after reviewing a draft of what was intended to be an op-ed in favor of a judicial nominee.\nKavanaugh addressed the decision on Wednesday, refusing to say whether he believed that Roe v. Wade, the decision that guaranteed a woman's right to an abortion, was correctly decided. He also said the Supreme Court had affirmed it in subsequent cases.\nOn Thursday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) read aloud from Kavanaugh's newly released email and said it has \"been viewed as you saying you don't think Roe is settled\" and asked him to explain.\nKavanaugh said he was referring not to his own views, but to the \"views of legal scholars.\"\nRead more here.\n- Mark Berman\n10:45 a.m.: On cameras in the court, Kavanaugh said he is open to hearing from other justices\nKavanaugh was asked about a common question regarding the court: Cameras or no cameras?\nThe Supreme Court itself operates in a relatively anachronistic format, blocking cameras - and most other forms of technology - when cases are argued and announced. The question of whether it should remain that way has been raised over the years, including to nominees who went on to join the court. During Justice Neil M. Gorsuch's confirmation hearings last year, he said he was open to hearing more about the issue.\nKavanaugh also said he was open to learning more, including from the justices already on the court to hear \"what they think about this.\"\n\"To learn, if I were to be confirmed, from the experience there and to see what the experience there is like,\" he said. \"To listen to the justices currently on the Supreme Court.\"\n- Mark Berman\n10:38 a.m.: Questioning begins and is promptly interrupted by protesters\nAn hour after the hearing got underway, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the committee chairman, began his questioning of Kavanaugh, who had not spoken while senators debated what to do with confidential documents.\nA protester shouting about health care and chanting \"SHAME\" was taken outside by police as Grassley began. Then, as Kavanaugh began to speak, a male protester quickly interrupted, standing on a chair and shouting, \"Save Democracy, save Roe!\" as he was hauled out of the committee room by the Capitol Police.\n10:30 a.m.: Senate Democrats in open revolt over confidential Kavanaugh documents\nAfter Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said he was willing to violate Senate rules and release confidential documents, Senate Democrats on the committee appeared in open revolt as Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) read aloud from the rules on expulsion. Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, also tweeted the rules on Thursday morning.\nCornyn read aloud from rules stating that a senator who discloses \"the secret or confidential business\" of the Senate could be \"liable ... to suffer expulsion.\"\nBooker responded by saying: \"Bring the charges.\" His comment was echoed by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who said: \"Apply the rule, bring the charges. All of us are ready to face that rule.\"\n\"This is about the closest I'll ever have in my life to an 'I am Spartacus' moment,\" Booker said.\nSen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) also joined in, saying: \"If there's going to be some retribution against the senator from New Jersey, count me in.\"\nTheir comments were echoed by Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who tweeted during the debate: \"I stand w/ Judiciary Committee Democrats who are well within their rights to release these very important documents that a former Kavanaugh deputy designed as 'committee confidential.' The American ppl deserve to know the truth about Judge Kavanaugh's record. #WhatAreTheyHiding?\"\n- Ann E. Marimow\n10 a.m.: Booker says he is willing to violate Senate rules to release confidential documents\nThe fight over access to Kavanaugh's records from his time in the Bush White House intensified in the opening moments of the hearing Thursday morning. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said he is prepared to violate Senate rules and release confidential committee documents - and to risk the consequences.\nBooker had questioned Kavanaugh Wednesday night about his use of the term \"naked racial set-aside\" and said he would make public documents backing up that assertion.\n\"I openly invite and accept the consequences of releasing that email right now,\" Booker said. \"The emails being withheld from the public have nothing to do with national security.\"\nUnder the committee's rules, Booker could be expelled from the Senate for releasing such records.\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.) angrily responded to Booker and referred to his potential aspirations for higher office, saying \"running for president is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate.\" Cornyn argued that \"this is no different from the senator deciding to release classified information that is deemed classified.\"\n9:34 a.m.: Hearing gets underway\nNearly 12 hours after the first day of questioning wrapped up, Kavanaugh is back before the Senate Judiciary Committee for more questioning. Kavanaugh took his seat at 9:33 a.m., sitting alone at the witness table with a stack of papers to his left and three small water bottles to his right.\nBefore the hearing began, the committee's Republican members were seen gathered around committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) while he spoke before they took their seats.\nGrassley gaveled in the hearing at 9:34 a.m.\n- Mark Berman\n8 a.m.: What to watch for in today's hearing\nThe third day of hearings will see Kavanaugh facing more questioning from senators. Among other things to expect and watch for:\n  The battle over access to records from Kavanaugh's tenure in the Bush White House is sure to resurface, with Democrats asking the committee to release additional documents that have not been disclosed to the public.\nSen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) implied Wednesday that there is evidence in confidential Senate Judiciary Committee records that Kavanaugh in 2003 was privy to an email allegedly stolen by a former committee staffer. Kavanaugh said he never knowingly dealt with stolen records. Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) did not guarantee that those documents would become public this week, but said, \"we'll try to get them.\"\n  More questions are likely about Kavanaugh's views on a host of pivotal issues, including guns, abortion, executive power, health care, affirmative action and more, as well as about his experiences on the bench and in the Bush White House.\n  Health care and the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act will continue to be a potent issue, particularly as a legal challenge to the law unfolds in a courtroom in Texas this week. The nominee says he can't assure senators that he would uphold the law's requirement that insurers cover people with preexisting conditions because doing so would compromise his judicial independence. Democrats say they will revisit the issue.\n  Loud, angry protests are likely to continue to punctuate the Senate debate about Kavanaugh's legal theory and judicial opinions. A phalanx of Capitol Police officers, dressed in dark blue and some with zip ties, have been a fixture against the back wall of the hearing room, poised to quietly haul out protesters. Capitol Police on Wednesday arrested and charged another 66 people with disorderly conduct for disrupting the hearings.\n  In one of the most confusing - and tense - exchanges Wednesday, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) raised the prospect without offering evidence that Kavanaugh may have spoken about the Mueller investigation with somebody at Kasowitz, Benson and Torres, a law firm that has represented Trump. It's unclear whether Harris will revisit the issue again Thursday, but the exchange went viral and quickly became one of the most talked-about moments of the Kavanaugh hearings.\n\nSupreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh appears during a confirmation hearing at the Hart Senate Office Building on Wednesday in Washington.

Dick Durbin, D-Ill., sought a promise from Kavanaugh that he would be willing to serve as a check on the president who nominated him.\n\"Give us some reassurance about your commitment to the democratic institutions in this country, in the face of a president who seems prepared to cast them aside,\" Durbin said. \"Whether it's voter suppression, the role of the media - case after case, we hear this president willing to walk away from the rule of law in this country.\"\n\"No one is above the law,\" Kavanaugh replied. \"I've made clear in my writings that a court order that requires a president to do something or prohibits a president from doing something under the Constitution or laws of the United States is the final word in our system.\"\nSen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, complained that the Supreme Court had been unduly deferential to President Trump this summer when it upheld his travel ban, despite what she called the administration's \"obviously bogus\" justification. She pressed Kavanaugh on when the high court should question a president's national security claims.\n\"National security is not a blank check for the president,\" Kavanaugh said, pointing to a number of cases in which the court had overruled the administration. \"Even in the context of wartime, the courts are not silenced. Civil liberties are not silent.\"\nKavanaugh told lawmakers he is so committed to judicial independence, he stopped voting in national elections after he became a judge.\nSen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., again asked Kavanaugh if he'd ever spoken with anyone at the law firm of Trump's personal attorney Marc Kasowitz about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, renewing a line of questioning she'd opened Wednesday night.\n\"The answer is no,\" Kavanaugh said.\nAs he's done throughout the hearing, Kavanaugh declined to answer a series of questions from Harris about issues that might come before the high court, including abortion, same-sex marriage and immigration.\nThe White House issued a statement late Thursday praising Kavanaugh.\n\"Through long hours and days of questioning, Judge Kavanaugh consistently reinforced his firm belief in the bedrock principles of judicial independence and the rule of law,\" deputy press secretary Raj Shah said in the statement.\nKavanaugh was asked repeatedly during the televised hearing about whether he would support opening the Supreme Court to TV cameras. He promised to keep an open mind, but said he would also want to consider the views of the eight current justices.\nThursday's session began with Democrats on the committee in open revolt over the handling of documents from Kavanaugh's tenure in the George W. Bush White House.\nSome documents have been withheld altogether. Others have been provided to the committee on \"confidential\" terms, meaning senators can see them but they can't be made public.\nDemocrats object that the confidential label has been applied to a wide swath of records, many of which contain no personal or sensitive information. They also complain that classification decisions were made by former President Bush's attorney, William Burck, a former deputy of Kavanaugh's.\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., released some of the confidential documents Thursday morning. Hirono also released \"confidential\" documents, drawing a stern rebuke from Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who called them \"irresponsible and outrageous.\"\n\"This is no different from the senator deciding to release classified information,\" Cornyn said Thursday morning. \"No senator deserves to sit on this committee, or serve in the Senate, in my view, if they decide to be a law unto themselves and willingly flout the rules of the Senate and the determination of confidentiality and classification.\"\nRead the documents released by Sen. Hirono here and the documents released by Sen. Leahy here.\nFor all the theatrics on both sides, the debate over documents fizzled by Thursday afternoon, once it became clear their release had been authorized by Bush's attorney overnight.\n\"We cleared the documents last night shortly after Senator Booker's staff asked us to,\" Burck said in a statement. \"In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public.\"\nAnd an aide to Grassley told NPR that \"counsels for the senators who requested waivers last night/this morning for particular documents were notified that their requests had been honored beginning at around 3:50 this morning.\"\nBut a spokesperson for Hirono said the senator was not informed that the documents released by her office Thursday morning had been approved to be made public.\nIt is not clear whether Booker knew the documents he released had already been approved before his statements Thursday morning at the beginning of the hearing - when he said that his decision to release the documents was a form of civil disobedience and that he was aware he was risking expulsion from the Senate for making the documents public.\n\"Cory said this morning that he was releasing committee confidential documents, and that's exactly what he's done,\" Booker spokeswoman Kristin Lynch said in an email to NPR. \"Last night, he was admonished by Republicans for breaking the rules when he read from committee confidential documents. Cory and Senate Democrats were able to shame the committee into agreeing to make last night's documents publicly available, and Cory publicly released those documents as well as other committee confidential documents today. And he'll keep releasing them because Republicans are hiding Brett Kavanaugh's record from the American people.\"\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP\nThe documents released by Booker include a batch of emails concerning racial profiling, affirmative action and other race-conscious government programs.\nIn a 2002 email, Kavanaugh wrote that security procedures adopted in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks should ultimately be race-neutral, though he acknowledged that developing such procedures could take time. Others in the White House suggested racial profiling might be legally justified if it enhanced security.\nIn a 2001 email, Kavanaugh addressed a legal challenge to an affirmative action program within the Department of Transportation.\n\"The fundamental problem in this case is that these DOT regulations use a lot of legalisms and disguises to mask what in reality is a naked racial set-aside,\" he wrote.\nKavanaugh had sidestepped questions from Booker on Wednesday night about the circumstances in which government can and cannot use race-conscious measures to address past discrimination.\nHe conceded that hopes he expressed nearly two decades ago for a color-blind society have not been fulfilled.\n\"We see on an all-too-common basis that racism still exists in the United States of America,\" Kavanaugh said. \"Our long march to racial equality is not over.\"\nSeparately, The New York Times reported on leaked emails from the \"confidential\" file.

Chris Christie of New Jersey had he opted for a White House bid.\nBut anger at big banks - manifested by the growing Occupy Wall Street protests in New York City and elsewhere - is palpable enough that Mr. Romney must avoid being seen as a friend of an industry that many Americans blame for onerous bank fees and underwater mortgages.", "documentTitle": null, "documentUrl": null}], "set_of_highlights_in_context": [{"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSentCharIdx": 0, "sent_idx": 0, "docSentText": "The number of donors who raise big money for President Barack Obama jumped in the last three months as he builds a war chest for what will likely be the costliest presidential election ever.\n", "docSpanText": "The number of donors who raise big money for President Barack Obama jumped", "docSpanOffsets": [[0, 74]], "scuSentCharIdx": 0.0, "scuSentence": "President Obama's big-money \"bundlers\" are on the rise, with at least 41 supporters now having raised more than $500,000 each for the president, reports MSNBC.", "prefix": ""}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSentCharIdx": 191, "sent_idx": 1, "docSentText": "At least 41 people have raised at least half a million dollars for the president, compared to 27 in Obama's first report, according to an analysis of campaign data released Friday.\n", "docSpanText": "At least 41 people have raised at least half a million dollars for the president", "docSpanOffsets": [[191, 271]], "scuSentCharIdx": 0.0, "scuSentence": "President Obama's big-money \"bundlers\" are on the rise, with at least 41 supporters now having raised more than $500,000 each for the president, reports MSNBC.", "prefix": ""}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSentCharIdx": 191, "sent_idx": 1, "docSentText": "At least 41 people have raised at least half a million dollars for the president, compared to 27 in Obama's first report, according to an analysis of campaign data released Friday.\n", "docSpanText": "compared to 27 in Obama's first report, according to an analysis of campaign data released", "docSpanOffsets": [[273, 363]], "scuSentCharIdx": 160.0, "scuSentence": "That's a sizeable jump from the 27 bundlers-well-connected supporters who help candidates raise big money-reported three months ago.", "prefix": "President Obama's big-money \"bundlers\" are on the rise, with at least 41 supporters now having raised more than $500,000 each for the president, reports MSNBC.

The relationships between the woman who died, as well as the badly injured child, to the bride and groom were unclear.\n\"The important thing is to focus on the family, to let them know that this community is behind them, and that we're praying for them,\" Whittier Mayor Joe Vinatieri said.\n  Related Story: 1 killed, child critical after tree topples onto wedding party at Whittier park\n\"It was supposed to be one of the most exciting days of their lives, and instead, it turned into what it turned into,\" he said.\n\"There's so many people in Whittier. ... Who are upset, as am I, asking, 'What can we do?'\" the mayor said. \"The best we can do right now is pray for that family and pray for that child, and let the family know that we care.\"\nPenn Park will remain closed to the public indefinitely as authorities investigate what caused the large eucalyptus tree to fall, City Manager Jeff Collier said.\nAn arborist is expected to inspect the scene today or Tuesday, he said.\nIt was too early to say what may have caused the tree to fall, according to Collier.\n\"We can't speculate until we have the arborist come out here and investigate,\" he said.\nUntil then, officials will not remove the debris.\n\"We want to preserve the scene at this point. We want to make sure we have a chance to see everything as it exists today,\" Collier said.\nWhile the city already has an ongoing program to maintain and inspect trees, officials are also in the process of double-checking the integrity of the many other towering trees in Penn Park, City Manager Jeff Collier said.\n  Photos: Tree falls on wedding party at Whittier park killing one\nPolice guarded the scene to keep away trespassers Sunday morning, as crews went through the debris to retrieve belongings of the victims.\nThe park, which is staffed by city officials seven days a week, is a popular site with wedding parties and other celebrations. Groups can often be seen posing for pictures beneath the park's giant trees.\n\"What's intrinsically wonderful about it is those trees,\" Vinatieri said.\nAs the investigation progresses, \"the important thing is to focus on that family,\" Vinatieri said. \"There's an outpouring of concern, sadness and prayer.\"\nInjuries due to sudden tree falls are uncommon, but not unheard of in the region.\nEight children were injured, two of them critically, when an 85-foot-tall Italian stone pine tree toppled over at the Kidspace Museum in Pasadena on July 28, 2015.\nThat incident also occurred following a bout of heavy rain amid years of drought.\nSaturday's accident in Whittier took place within days of Southern California's first significant storm of the season.\nAn arborist concluded the tree in Pasadena likely fell because it was taking in more water than it could release, increasing its weight, coupled with weak roots on two sides of the tree.\nThe family of 6-year-old twins injured in the incident have since filed a lawsuit against the museum alleging the incident was the result of negligence and failure to maintain the tree. Kidspace Museum subsequently filed a claim against the city of Pasadena, arguing that the city is liable for any legal costs or damages associated with the incident.

Put another way, all five Republican appointees are to the right of all four Democratic appointees. It was not long ago that Republican appointees like Justices John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter routinely voted with the court's liberal wing.\nAs a consequence of the current alignment, Professor Devins said, \"the Roberts court has generated more marquee decisions divided by party alignment than all other courts combined.\"\nThe last term's big cases did not for the most part follow that pattern because Justice Kennedy, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan and sits at the court's ideological fulcrum, voted with the court's liberal wing at an unusually high rate.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\"The story of the last term is that the left side of the court did a lot of winning,\" said Irving L.

The Supreme Court punted on her case in 2013, and now it's back on the docket. Like the unions case, this was brought by a conservative group that recruited the plaintiffs. The death penalty: Justices will decide on capital-punishment cases in Pennsylvania, Kansas, Georgia, and Florida, the Wall Street Journal reports. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer have already expressed doubts about whether capital punishment is constitutional. \"One person, one vote\": Should state legislative districts be drawn based on their number of people or eligible voters? If justices choose the latter-leaving out immigrants and children-Latinos could lose political clout and rural areas will gain, Politico reports. Abortion: Justices may opt to revisit a Texas law that could reduce the state's abortion clinics from more than 40 to roughly 10. At issue is whether new clinic requirements are an \"undue burden\" on women's right to an abortion. One commentator believes this Supreme Court session will be ugly for liberals.", "query": null}

It already offers LGBT travel deals, including the \"out and proud\" package and the \"civil unions romance special.\"\nBigger beachfront resorts are also getting in on the action. The Sheraton Waikiki is the only hotel on Oahu providing on-site marriage licenses. General Manager Kelly Sanders says now the hotel is running a new ad campaign in mainland LGBT publications.\n\"Yes, there's a revenue opportunity,\" says Sanders. \"There's an opportunity for all of us to really have that great success, but in my mind it's something that should have happened already. And so it's just now being able to really open all of our arms as wide as they can be and say welcome.\"\nIt was Hawaii that back in 1991 touched off the national conversation about same-sex marriage. Then, three couples sued to force the state to issue them marriage licenses. Now, more than two decades later, Hawaii is the latest state to recognize marriage equality.

Description\n\nStraight Grip (T-grip)\nThe straight grip provides a fixed hand placement at right angle to the implement shaft.\n\nD-ring Handle (D-grip)\nThe d-ring handle provides a hand placement site, which is slightly displaced from the implement shaft. The d-ring can be positioned at any angle relative to the shaft but is typically positioned close to a right angle to the shaft.\n\nII. Method\n\nA pseudo-static, biomechanical assessment of the straight grip Power-Grip product was undertaken in case study fashion for a simple shoveling task. The Newtonian equations for static equilibrium were developed to estimate the trunk joint moment required to hold a load with and without the straight hand-grip. A dynamic and EMG analysis was not undertaken.\n\nIII. Results for the Straight Grip\n\nA. This hand-grip permits the wrist angle to remain in a near neutral position in the ulnar/radial plane. The amount of ulnar deviation is limited to a maximum of 10 degrees as compared to 35 degrees (near the end of range of motion) without the use of the straight grip.\n\nIn lifting with an implement, the wrist can undergo maximum ulnar deviation during a specific period. This results in compression of the tissues located on the ulnar side of the wrist (the ulnar nerve, blood supply, carpal ligaments, tendons, etc.) and tension in the radially located tissues. Prolonged or repetitive loading of a joint at the end of range of motion can be deleterious to the tissues. In the mid-range of a joint, the muscles can operate efficiently to bear the load, however, in the end of range of motion, the passive tissues bear a disproportionate amount of the load since the muscles are in a compromised position. The decreased ulnar deviation resulting from the use of the straight grip is beneficial to the structures in and about the wrist.\n\nB. The hand-grip requires the forearm to be in a pronated position.\n\nWithout the use of the straight grip, the forearm would be in a supinated position. This positioning influences the set of muscles recruited to perform the task. Most notably, with the forearm in a supinated position, the biceps brachii can operate to control the amount of supination and is in an advantaged position to aid in elbow flexion. When the straight grip is used, the forearm is positioned in pronation. This positioning results in a different muscle strategy to be employed during the lifting task. The biceps brachii is positioned in a relatively lengthened position and the forearm extensors and forearm supinators are required to control the degree of pronation. The difference in lifting with the straight grip represents a substitution of muscles required to perform the task. An electromyographical analysis would be required to establish the precise muscle activation pattern. This may limit the amount of elbow flexion used to perform the task enabling the user to incorporate larger trunk and lower limb musculature.\n\nC. The change in wrist position and forearm pronation results in an increased shoulder abduction angle (5-10 degrees).\n\nThe change in wrist position requires the shoulder to be abducted. The lifting task normally involves the use of shoulder abductors. When the straight grip is used the starting angle for the abduction movement is greater. The change in joint angle would alter the muscle activation pattern required to perform the task. It is possible to speculate that the supraspinatus muscle, which is claimed to account for the first 5 degrees of abduction, would not be involved in the abduction when the straight grip is employed, instead the larger deltoid muscles would be primarily involved. This may result in a decreased likelihood of tendinitis (or similar disorder) of the intrinsic shoulder muscles. This speculation would have to be examined with electromyographical analysis.\n\nD. The change in upper limb kinematics (joint angles) due to the hand-grip reduces the trunk flexion angle in the neighborhood of 5 degrees.\n\nThe kinematics of the upper limb holding on to the straight grip allows the trunk to remain in a more upright position during a lifting task. This results in a decreased effort from the extensor muscles of the hip and back since they do not have to work as hard to hold up the weight of the trunk. These muscles do not have to work as hard since there is i) a decrease in the moment of the weight of the upper body due to a decrease in the moment arm, and ii) a decrease in the moment of the weight of the load (that being lifted) due to a decrease in the moment arm are (the perpendicular distance from the line of action of the weight force acting vertically downward to the specific axis of rotation, say the L4 vertebral axis). This decrease in the moment of the load and upper body weight would be in the order of 5%. For repetitive tasks this small decrease would result in substantial energy savings and may result in less cumulative trauma.\n\n\n\n E. The change in upper body kinematics (joint angles) allows the load borne by the implement to be carried closer (about 5 cm) in the para-sagittal plane to the joint axes of rotation, most notable the hip and lumbar vertebral axes, as well as the upper limb axes (shoulder and elbow).\n\nSimilar to point D., when the lifted load is carried closer to the body this results in a decrease in the moment arm of the load relative to the body's axes of rotation (hip, lumbar, shoulder, etc.). The decrease in moment arm reduces the tendency of the load to rotate downward which proportionately relieves the muscles from having to rotate the load upward. The magnitude of this effect is between 3 and 5 %.\n\nThe overall reduction in load arising from the decrease in trunk angle and the closer load carrying is near 10%. This is a substantial amount, not only for repetitive tasks, but also for a single execution of a task. This would be beneficial for prevention and rehabilitation of low back injuries.\n\n\n\n F. The hand-grip did not result in an observable change in lower limb kinematics.\n\nThe method employed in this study did not permit accurate evaluation of lower limb kinematics. A video motion analysis would be required for this purpose.\n\n\n\n G. The hand-grip constrains the user to a specific set of lifting postures.\n\nThis constraint arises from the fact that the user must hold the grip and since the grip is fixed on the implement shaft the user's upper limbs are required to maintain a fixed geometry during lifting. Any task executed repetitively results in specific muscle fatigue, as such it may be beneficial to allow the user to rest or the freedom to adopt different postures to perform the same task which results in a substitution of non-fatigued muscles for the fatiguing muscles. This factor is primarily related to user understanding of proper lifting concepts and is not actually limited by the straight grip (i.e. changing the position of the straight grip periodically).\n\n\n\n H. The straight grip was found to fit any of the 14 different implements tested independent of:\n\n1. material (plastic, metal or wood),\n2. shaft diameter\n3. the presence of water (rain).\n\nThe straight grip was found to loosen or tighten somewhat with variations in temperature. The user would be advised to check that the grip is secure before each use.\n\n\n\n I. The hand-grip reduces the potential for blister formation.\n\nThe kinematics of lifting without the hand-grip involves movement of the hand relative to the shaft resulting in skin surface shear which leads to blistering. With the use of the straight grip the magnitude of skin surface shear may be less which would result in a decrease in blister formation.\n\n\n\n\nCASE STUDY ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\"hand-grip permits the wrist angle to remain in a near neutral position\"...\"beneficial to the structures in and about the wrist.\"\n\"enabling the user to incorporate larger trunk and lower limb musculature.\"\n\"decreased likelihood of tendinitis (or similar disorder) of the intrinsic shoulder muscles\"\n\"remain in a more upright position during a lifting task\"...\"substantial energy savings and may result in less cumulative trauma.\"\n\"The overall reduction in load arising from the decrease in trunk angle and the closer load carrying is near 10%.

A few other things will lessen your risk: Don't start shoveling while snow is still falling (it's colder, so you'll put additional strain on your heart); don't bundle up too much (getting too hot isn't good, either); and don't drink coffee (it increases your heart rate) or hot cocoa (who knows why?) right before shoveling.

"], "rawDocumentText": "\n(Packaged in cans by Sierra Nevada, and draught from amazing brewers across the country. Available late December!)\nWhen the Camp Fire started in the hills above our Chico brewery on November 8, 2018, it soon became the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history. The fire burned more than 153,000 acres, killed at least 85 people, and destroyed more than 13,000 homes. Many of our employees and community members were severely impacted by this tragic event.\nIn the days following the fire, we announced plans to brew Resilience Butte County Proud IPA, a fundraiser beer for Camp Fire relief. We committed to brewing the beer and donating 100% of the sales to the Sierra Nevada Camp Fire Relief Fund, aimed at long-term community rebuilding support. And we asked every brewery in the country to do it with us.\nWe sent out the \"bat signal\" calling our friends in the industry, asking our suppliers to donate ingredients, asking other breweries (our competitors) to donate their time and labor costs, and asking our wholesalers and retailers to carry the beer for free. It was a big ask, and we never could have anticipated the response.\nMore than 1,400 breweries signed up to brew Resilience. Our suppliers donated ingredients to every brewery nationwide. Wholesalers and retailers agreed to carry the beer and donate every dollar they received. All of them agreed to do this for free to benefit people they had never met.\nIn all, Resilience Butte County Proud IPA should hit the market in mid-late December more than 17,000 barrels-or 4.2 million pints-strong. Every dollar Sierra Nevada receives will go to those impacted by the Camp Fire.\nThank you to the brewing community. Thank you to our suppliers. Thank you to our wholesalers and retailers. And thank you to every single customer who is helping us rebuild our Butte County community-one pint at a time.\nBrewers | Malt Suppliers | Hop Suppliers | Wholesalers\nResilience Night\nWhen: December 20th\nWhere: Your favorite participating brewery\nPlease join us for Resilience Night! On Thursday, December 20, we'll raise a glass with the 1,400+ breweries around the world brewing Resilience Butte County Proud IPA, our fundraiser beer for Camp Fire relief. Head to your local participating brewery to try their version of Resilience IPA-every dollar spent on Resilience will benefit those impacted by the Camp Fire. Together, we can raise more than $10 million to rebuild Butte County.\nUntappd\nWe are excited to announce that, starting December 15th, Untappd is participating in the release of Resilience IPA by offering its users a limited edition badge that can be earned by checking in to ANY Resilience IPA FROM ANY of the breweries that are officially participating. Not an Untappd user? Join today!\nWhere to get Resilience!?\nCans\nResilience IPA is packaged in cans by Sierra Nevada. The beer is starting to ship now. It will take some time for it to get from us, to the wholesalers, to the retailers. The amount of time depends on several factors, but distance is the main determiner. You can use our beer locator to find retailers nationwide that have it. The locator is updated continuously, so check back often.\nFind Resilience IPA at Retail\nDraught\nResilience IPA is available on draught from more than 1,400 breweries. You can use the brewer map below to locate participating breweries, and visit them for a pint!\nFind Resilience IPA on Draught\nBrewers\nThank you to the more than 1,400 breweries around the world who have so graciously volunteered to brew Resilience and donate 100% of the sales.

Sierra Nevada brewed its batch of Resilience IPA on Tuesday, founder Ken Grossman said in a statement, and the brewer will make it available in late December. \"We know that the rebuilding process will take time, but we're in this for the long haul,\" Grossman says. \"Our hope is to get Resilience IPA in taprooms all over the country to create a solid start for our community's future.\" (Check out participating breweries here.) While the Camp Fire, which was fully contained as of Sunday, left the Sierra Nevada brewery unscathed, it did destroy the homes of 15% of the company's employees, KRCR reports.

It's very slow, painstaking work,\" said Houston.\nThe black boxes record cockpit data and may provide answers about what happened to the plane, which was carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew when it vanished on March 8 and flew thousands of kilometers off its Kuala Lumpur-to-Beijing route.\nAuthorities say evidence, including the loss of communications, suggests the plane was deliberately diverted by someone familiar with the aircraft, but have not ruled out mechanical problems.\nAnalysis of satellite data led investigators to conclude the Boeing 777 came down in an area some 1,680 km (1,040 miles) northwest of Perth, near where possible pings were picked up and the search is now focused.\nBLUEFIN ON HOLD\nAn autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) named Bluefin-21 is onboard the Ocean Shield and could be sent to look for wreckage on the sea floor, but narrowing the search zone first was critical, Houston said.\n\"It is a large area for a small submersible that has a very narrow field of search, and of course, it is literally crawling along the bottom of the ocean,\" he said.\n\"That's why it's so important to get another transmission and we need to continue until there's absolutely no chance the (black box) device is still transmitting.\"\nThe Bluefin will scour the ocean floor in 20-hour missions using sonar in an attempt to find the aircraft, before its findings are downloaded and analyzed on board the Ocean Shield.\nIf anything unusual is spotted, the sonar on board the robotic vehicle will be replaced with a camera to take a closer look. The potential search area is about 4.5 km (2.8 miles) deep, the outer reach of the Bluefin's range.\nSome 133 missions have been completed so far in the multinational aerial hunt for debris in the southern Indian Ocean and would continue, officials said.\nUp to 11 military planes, three civilian planes and 14 ships planned to take part in the search on Tuesday, with good weather in the search area. But so far, searchers have only turned up fishing gear and other detritus.\n\"Even after the black box is found, the surface search will continue because they're looking for evidence to investigate why the aircraft went down,\" Lieutenant Commander Adam Schantz, the officer in charge of U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon search unit, told Reuters.\n\"So, we'll continue for a while trying to find anything on the surface that might give a reasoning behind the accident.\"\n(Additional reporting by Jane Wardell in Sydney and Anuradha Raghu in Kuala Lumpur; Editing by Dean Yates and Michael Perry)", "documentTitle": null, "documentUrl": null}], "set_of_highlights_in_context": [{"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSentCharIdx": 20, "sent_idx": 1, "docSentText": "Search crews hunting for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet have failed to relocate faint sounds heard deep below the southern Indian Ocean that officials said were consistent with a plane's black boxes, the head of the search operation said Tuesday.\n", "docSpanText": "Search crews<HIGHLIGHT_SEP>have failed to relocate faint sounds", "docSpanOffsets": [[20, 32], [79, 115]], "scuSentCharIdx": 0.0, "scuSentence": "When an Australian ship heard pings possibly from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, officials saw a big lead open up in the search-but since then, investigators haven't been able to recapture the signal, Reuters reports.", "prefix": ""}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSentCharIdx": 270, "sent_idx": 2, "docSentText": "Angus Houston, the retired Australian air chief marshal who is heading the search far off Australia's west coast, said sound locating equipment on board ", "docSpanText": "equipment", "docSpanOffsets": [[404, 413]], "scuSentCharIdx": 0.0, "scuSentence": "When an Australian ship heard pings possibly from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, officials saw a big lead open up in the search-but since then, investigators haven't been able to recapture the signal, Reuters reports.", "prefix": ""}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSentCharIdx": 423, "sent_idx": 3, "docSentText": "the Ocean Shield has picked up no trace of the signals since they were first heard late Saturday and early Sunday.\n", "docSpanText": "has picked up no trace of the signals since they were", "docSpanOffsets": [[440, 493]], "scuSentCharIdx": 0.0, "scuSentence": "When an Australian ship heard pings possibly from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, officials saw a big lead open up in the search-but since then, investigators haven't been able to recapture the signal, Reuters reports.", "prefix": ""}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSentCharIdx": 1601, "sent_idx": 13, "docSentText": "The towed pinger locator detected late Saturday and early Sunday two distinct, long-lasting sounds underwater that are consistent with the pings from an aircraft's \"black boxes\" - the flight data and cockpit voice recorders, Houston said, dubbing the find a promising lead in the month-long hunt for clues to the plane's fate.\n", "docSpanText": "Houston said, dubbing the find a promising lead in the month-long hunt for clues to the plane's fate", "docSpanOffsets": [[1826, 1926]], "scuSentCharIdx": 0.0, "scuSentence": "When an Australian ship heard pings possibly from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, officials saw a big lead open up in the search-but since then, investigators haven't been able to recapture the signal, Reuters reports.", "prefix": ""}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSentCharIdx": 363, "sent_idx": 3, "docSentText": "An Australian ship which picked up possible \"pings\" from the black box recorders of a missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner has been unable to detect any further signals and time is running out to narrow the massive search, officials said on Tuesday.\n", "docSpanText": "An Australian ship which picked up possible \"pings\" from the black box recorders of a missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner has been unable to detect any further signals", "docSpanOffsets": [[363, 529]], "scuSentCharIdx": 0.0, "scuSentence": "When an Australian ship heard pings possibly from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, officials saw a big lead open up in the search-but since then, investigators haven't been able to recapture the signal, Reuters reports.", "prefix": ""}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSentCharIdx": 538, "sent_idx": 4, "docSentText": "Time may have already run out to find the devices, whose locator beacons have a battery life of about a month.

While we are leaving Palo Alto, the organization I co-founded that is working to invest in housing and transportation will continue on its work so that maybe in the future we can have a more inclusive community. If you'd like to learn more, go here.\nIf you'd like to look into the belly of the beast, read the comments on our local paper: Palo Alto Online. The loudest voices in the community feel that the desire to create more affordable housing is spoiled entitlement. Until renters, younger people, and people of more modest means organize, this problem will continue throughout the Bay Area.

Simpson was convicted of leading a group of associates into a room at the Palace Station Hotel and Casino and using threats, guns and force to take back items from two dealers. Hide Caption 22 of 23 Photos: The rise and fall of O.J. Simpson Disgraced football star O.J. Simpson appears in court on May 13, 2013, seeking to get his robbery, assault and kidnapping convictions thrown out after spending more than four years in prison. He argued that bad legal advice led to his arrest and conviction in a confrontation with sports memorabilia dealers. His 2008 conviction came 13 years after his acquittal on murder charges in the deaths of ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. Hide Caption 23 of 23\nSimpson's legal team argued that the nine-to-33-year sentence did not match the crime and that it was, in fact, a form of payback for his controversial acquittal in the deaths of Brown and Goldman. Even Bruce Fromong, a victim in the robbery, agreed.\n\"It wasn't about justice,\" Fromong said in \"O.J.: Made in America.\" \"They wanted the guy that got away with murder in 1994.\"\nSimpson has always denied he killed Brown and Goldman. Their families won a wrongful death civil judgment against him in 1997.\nAt a parole hearing in 2013, Simpson said he regretted the Las Vegas kidnapping and robbery.\n\"I just wish I had never gone to that room. I wish I had just said, 'Keep it,' and not worry about it,\" he said.

Mack's husband has been vocal about being anti-Donald Trump, citing him as a racist. Baio is one of Trump's strongest celebrity supporters in Hollywood.\nAccording to the report, Scott Baio told police that he asked Nancy Mack to keep it down because kids were present, but she didn't back down. The wife of the Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer demanded to know how he could support a man who said, \"Grab 'em by the pu**y.\"\nBaio says she repeatedly screamed, \"Grab 'em by the pu**y.\"\nScott asked Nancy to stop, but she continued screaming the comment. He said at that point, Mack began attacked him physically by grabbing him under his arms, shaking, and pushing him.\nSources close to Nancy Mack claim she was mimicking how Donald Trump hugs women and meant no actual harm against Scott Baio.\nThe Ventura County Sheriff's Department is reportedly investigating the incident. Mack is listed as a battery suspect.\nScott Baio has taken a lot of heat for being a Donald Trump supporter, but he's dished a lot of it back to critics. Throughout the campaign, people were on Twitter issuing threats and he was one of the rare celebrities who voiced his support for the Republican president-elect. He spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention, saying in his speech that Hillary Clinton wanted the presidency only for herself, not for the American people.\n'Let's not just make America great again Let's make America..

"], "rawDocumentText": "As Hurricane Irene swung north Thursday, putting the Washington region in its sights, Maryland and Virginia declared a state of emergency and Sunday's dedication of the memorial to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was postponed.\nOrganizers said the event will be rescheduled for September or October. The memorial, the first on the Mall honoring an African American, has been a quarter-century in the making, but safety trumped ceremony.\nHurricane Irene was forecast to sweep over the Outer Banks of North Carolina overnight Friday and advance into the Washington area with a vanguard of showers beginning Saturday afternoon.\nEarly Friday morning, the National Weather Service upgraded the Tropical Storm Watch issued for much of the D.C. area to a Tropical Storm Warning. Meanwhile, Irene weakened slightly to a Category 2 storm as it approached the East Coast, where a hurricane warning was also extended to New Jersey.\nIf the hurricane stays on track, the worst of Irene will arrive in Virginia, Maryland and the District later Saturday and into Sunday morning. Late-summer vacationers evacuated Atlantic coast beaches, which are expected to be hit hardest before the storm wallops New England.\nThe intensity of the storm and the shift in the forecast track farther to the west prompted the decision to delay the memorial dedication, said Harry E. Johnson Sr., chief executive of the memorial project foundation.\n\"I'm disappointed and hurt, really,\" Johnson said. \"But the memorial is going to be there forever.\"\nJohnson said the change might allow those who planned to travel to stay home and for those in Washington to leave ahead of the storm.\nGovernors along the coast, including those in Virginia and Maryland, declared states of emergency Thursday, and thousands of weekend events were canceled.\n\"This is a large, this is a deadly, this is a slow-moving hurricane that is bearing down on the state of Maryland,\" Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley (D) said in declaring an emergency. \"There will no doubt be a lot of flooding. Citizens should anticipate long periods of electrical outages.\"\nA significant storm surge is expected to flood coastal areas, and wind-driven flooding may occur along the shores of the Chesapeake Bay. The worst of the weather is likely to be east of the Interstate 95 corridor, which may get four to six inches of rain, prolonged winds of 50 to 70 mph, and gusts of 90 to 100 mph, according to meteorologists with The Washington Post's Capital Weather Gang.\nAmtrak canceled train departures from Southeastern states and curtailed some service in the Northeast. Airports said they expected flight delays and cancellations through the weekend, with many airlines allowing fliers to change their plans without penalty.\nAn endless stream of vacationers rolled across the bridge out of Ocean City, on Thursday evening, and homeowners rushed in the opposite direction to board up their rental properties. Ocean City was one of many resort areas where evacuation was mandatory.\nColleges on the verge of opening for the fall semester warned students to delay their arrival, and the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg told its students to go home.\nThree other schools - the University of Maryland, George Washington University and Catholic University - said they would open their dormitories a day early, on Friday, so that students could get settled before the storm hit. George Mason University said it would implement a flexible move-in schedule.\nIn New York, the Associated Press reported that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I) said officials expect to shut down the city's transit system Saturday afternoon ahead of the hurricane, which is forecast to strike eastern Queens.\nAfter passing over the Bahamas on Thursday, the storm first fell on the U.S. coast in Florida, where its outermost bands swept in with bursts of wind and rain and a driving riptide.\nThe exodus from the Outer Banks began early Thursday after an evacuation order Wednesday night. Traffic on Route 168 crawled as lines of sport-utility vehicles with surfboards and fishing rods mounted on their roofs headed north from the barrier islands.\n\"My aunt and uncle are used to storms, but they got a bit worried about this one,\" said Melissa Wallace of St. Louis, who had been vacationing at their Cape Hatteras beach house. \"We just thought better safe than sorry.\"\nIn the Washington region, there were warnings that people should be prepared for power outages as toppling trees take down electrical lines.

Irene's hurricane-strength winds of at least 74 mph extend 70 miles from its core, and tropical-storm- strength winds reach out 290 miles.\nThe last hurricane to strike the U.S. was Ike in 2008, a Category 2 storm when it went ashore near Galveston, Texas. The most recent major hurricane, one with winds of at least 111 mph, was Wilma in 2005.\nFarther east in the Atlantic, Tropical Depression 10 probably will be upgraded to a tropical storm today, the center said. The next tropical storm will be named Jose.\nThe system is about 505 miles west of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands and moving west-northwest across open waters at 12 mph, the Miami-based center said.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Brian K.

Al Sharpton, who called for protests in the earlier cases, said he \"didn't know\" whether an indictment was appropriate for Officer Liang.\n\"There has to be a full investigation,\" Mr. Sharpton said, cautioning that supporters of the officer \"should not rush to judgment and say it is an accident when they don't know what happened.\"\nUnited States Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat who represents parts of Brooklyn, said Mr. Thompson's decision was \"a meaningful step in the right direction.\"\n\"Akai Gurley did not deserve to die,\" he said, \"and the evidence of a kill shot that penetrated his chest and struck him in the heart suggests something more than a noncriminal accident.\"\nA similar shooting occurred in January 2004, when Timothy Stansbury Jr., 19, was killed on a roof at the Louis Armstrong Houses in Brooklyn by Officer Richard S. Neri Jr. A grand jury declined to indict Officer Neri after he testified that he had unintentionally discharged his weapon after Mr. Stansbury pushed open a rooftop door, startling him.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nGiven what is known about the Gurley case, said Delores Jones-Brown, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who directs its Center on Race, Crime and Justice, it seemed likely that a jury would consider criminally negligent homicide and reckless endangerment charges.\nA central question for the grand jury to consider, Professor Jones-Brown said, is \"what police are trained and authorized to do in these kinds of situations.\" If the police action goes against training and police guidelines, the next step would be to determine how much of the officer's behavior had diverged from \"the kind of care he should've been exercising,\" she said.\nThe investigation into the shooting so far has covered the first minutes after the officer shot Mr. Gurley, a law enforcement official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about an ongoing case. Mr. Liang may have used his phone to send a text message during that period, the source said, The Daily News reported on Friday.\nJames P. O'Neill, chief of department and the highest ranking uniformed officer in the Police Department, declined to comment on Officer Liang's actions.\n\"This is an ongoing investigation by our department and the Brooklyn district attorney's office,\" Chief O'Neill said. \"I really can't talk about it.\"\nThe Daily News suggested that Officer Liang was texting a representative of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, although a spokesman for the union said that account did \"not appear to be true.\" Nonetheless, one police official said, it was not unusual for an on-duty officer to seek guidance from a union representative after firing a gun.\nMr. Jeffries said that in the Gurley case, he hoped a grand jury would vote for an indictment.\n\"That doesn't necessarily mean a conviction, but it should mean an indictment that allows the facts to be aired in a public trial,\" he said. \"When unarmed black men are killed by police officers, we need public trials to help restore confidence in the criminal justice system.\"", "documentTitle": null, "documentUrl": null}], "set_of_highlights_in_context": [{"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSentCharIdx": 0, "sent_idx": 0, "docSentText": "A rookie cop who shot and killed an unarmed Brooklyn man in an unlit housing project staircase was indicted for manslaughter Tuesday, the Daily News has learned.\n", "docSpanText": "A rookie cop<HIGHLIGHT_SEP>shot and killed an unarmed<HIGHLIGHT_SEP>man in an unlit housing project staircase", "docSpanOffsets": [[0, 12], [17, 43], [53, 94]], "scuSentCharIdx": 0.0, "scuSentence": "A rookie cop with the NYPD will face criminal charges after shooting an unarmed black man to death in a stairwell, reports the Wall Street Journal.", "prefix": ""}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSentCharIdx": 162, "sent_idx": 1, "docSentText": "In a blockbuster grand jury decision, Peter Liang will face criminal charges that can send him to prison for up to 15 years for the death of Akai Gurley on Nov. 20, a source said.\n", "docSpanText": "Peter Liang will face criminal charges<HIGHLIGHT_SEP>for the death of Akai Gurley", "docSpanOffsets": [[200, 238], [286, 314]], "scuSentCharIdx": 0.0, "scuSentence": "A rookie cop with the NYPD will face criminal charges after shooting an unarmed black man to death in a stairwell, reports the Wall Street Journal.", "prefix": ""}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSentCharIdx": 464, "sent_idx": 4, "docSentText": "A source said Liang, 27, was indicted for a top count second-degree manslaughter, which means he acted recklessly.

You can see the updated terms here.\nGoing forward, rather than obtain permission from you to introduce possible advertising products we have not yet developed, we are going to take the time to complete our plans, and then come back to our users and explain how we would like for our advertising business to work.\nYou also had deep concerns about whether under our new terms, Instagram had any plans to sell your content. I want to be really clear: Instagram has no intention of selling your photos, and we never did. We don't own your photos - you do.\nFinally, there was also confusion about how widely shared and distributed your photos are through our service. The distribution of your content and photos is governed by our privacy policy, and always has been. We have made a small change to our terms to make that as clear as possible.\nYou can view the current terms and privacy policy, as well as review the updated terms and privacy policy that will take effect on January 19, 2013.\nI'm proud that Instagram has a community that feels so strongly about a product we all love. I'm even more proud that you feel empowered to be vocal and approach us with constructive feedback to help us build a better product. Thank you for your feedback, and I look forward to all that Instagram has to bring in the New Year.\nThank you,\nKevin Systrom co-founder, Instagram ", "documentTitle": null, "documentUrl": null}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSentCharIdxToSentIdx": [0, 68, 227, 452, 453, 726, 728, 989, 1176, 1467, 1632, 1633, 1733, 1775, 1921, 2081, 2115, 2117, 2286, 2379, 2437, 2438, 2661, 2662, 2706, 2738, 2740, 3003, 3097, 3297, 3435, 3722, 3870, 4023, 4174, 4235, 4422, 4561, 4734, 4924, 4970, 5098, 5099, 5198, 5199, 5261], "documentText": [" Eric Piermont/Agence France-Presse - Getty Images\n\nSAN FRANCISCO - ", "In the aftermath of the uproar over changes to Instagram's privacy policy and terms of service earlier this week, the company did an about-face late Thursday.\n", "In a blog post on the company's site, Kevin Systrom, Instagram's co-founder, said that where advertising was concerned, the company would revert to its previous terms of service, which have been in effect since October 2010.\n", "\"", "Rather than obtain permission from you to introduce possible advertising products we have not yet developed,\" he wrote, \"we are going to take the time to complete our plans, and then come back to our users and explain how we would like for our advertising business to work.", "\" ", "Users had been particularly concerned by a clause in Instagram's policy introduced on Monday that suggested Instagram would share users' data - like their favorite places, bands, restaurants and hobbies - with Facebook and its advertisers to better target ads.\n", "They also took issue with an update to the company's terms of service that suggested users' photos could be used in advertisements, without compensation and even without their knowledge.\n", "The terms of that user agreement said, \"You agree that a business or other entity may pay us to display your user name, likeness, photos (along with any associated metadata) and/or actions you take, in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions, without any compensation to you.", "\"\nFollowing a reaction that included customers defecting to other services, Mr. Systrom told Instagram users on Tuesday that the new policy had been misinterpreted.

", "Other countries may have their own country-of-origin marking requirements. ", "As a result, exporters should determine whether the country to which they are exporting imposes such requirements.\n", "What kinds of claims does the Enforcement Policy Statement apply to?\n", "The Enforcement Policy Statement applies to U.S. origin claims that appear on products and labeling, advertising, and other promotional materials.

", "Depending on the context, U.S. symbols or geographic references (for example, U.S. flags, outlines of U.S. maps, or references to U.S. locations of headquarters or factories) may convey a claim of U.S. origin either by themselves, or in conjunction with other phrases or images.\n", "Example: A company promotes its product in an ad that features a manager describing the \"true American quality\" of the work produced at the company's American factory. ", "Although there is no express representation that the company's product is made in the U.S., the overall - or net - impression the ad is likely to convey to consumers is that the product is of U.S. origin.\n", "Brand names and trademarks\nOrdinarily", ", the Commission will not consider a manufacturer or marketer's use of an American brand name or trademark by itself as a U.S. origin claim.

", "The fact that the company is headquartered in the U.S. also is widely known. ", "Company pamphlets for its foreign-made product prominently feature its brand name. ", "Assuming that the brand name does not specifically denote U.S. origin (that is, the brand name is not \"Made in America, Inc.\"), using the brand name by itself does not constitute a claim of U.S. origin.\n", "Representations about entire product lines\nManufacturers and marketers should not indicate, either expressly or implicitly, that a whole product line is of U.S. origin (\"Our products are made in USA\") when only some products in the product line are made in the U.S. according to the \"all or virtually all\" standard.\n", "Does the FTC pre-approve Made in USA claims?\n", "The Commission does not pre-approve advertising or labeling claims. ", "A company doesn't need approval from the Commission before making a Made in USA claim. ", "As with most other advertising claims, a manufacturer or marketer may make any claim as long as it is truthful and substantiated.\n", "The Standard For Unqualified Made ", "In USA Claims\n", "What is the standard for a product to be called Made in USA without qualification?\n", "For a product to be called Made in USA, or claimed to be of domestic origin without qualifications or limits on the claim, the product must be \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S. ", "The term \"United States,\" as referred to in the Enforcement Policy Statement, includes the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories and possessions.\n", "What does \"all or virtually all\" mean?\n", "\"", "All or virtually all\" means that all significant parts and processing that go into the product must be of U.S. origin. ", "That is, the product should contain no - or negligible - foreign content.\n", "What substantiation is required for a Made in USA claim?\n", "When a manufacturer or marketer makes an unqualified claim that a product is Made in USA, it should have - and rely on - a \"reasonable basis\" to support the claim at the time it is made. ", "This means a manufacturer or marketer needs competent and reliable evidence to back up the claim that its product is \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S.\n", "What factors does the Commission consider to determine whether a product is \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S.?\n", "The product's final assembly or processing must take place in the U.S. ", "The Commission then considers other factors, including how much of the product's total manufacturing costs can be assigned to U.S. parts and processing, and how far removed any foreign content is from the finished product. ", "In some instances, only a small portion of the total manufacturing costs are attributable to foreign processing, but that processing represents a significant amount of the product's overall processing. ", "The same could be true for some foreign parts. ", "In these cases, the foreign content (processing or parts) is more than negligible, and, as a result, unqualified claims are inappropriate.\n", "Example: A company produces propane barbecue grills at a plant in Nevada. ", "The product's major components include the gas valve, burner and aluminum housing, each of which is made in the U.S. ", "The grill's knobs and tubing are imported from Mexico. ", "An unqualified Made in USA claim is not likely to be deceptive because the knobs and tubing make up a negligible portion of the product's total manufacturing costs and are insignificant parts of the final product. ", "Example: A table lamp is assembled in the U.S. from American-made brass, an American-made Tiffany-style lampshade, and an imported base. ", "The base accounts for a small percent of the total cost of making the lamp. ", "An unqualified Made in USA claim is deceptive for two reasons: The base is not far enough removed in the manufacturing process from the finished product to be of little consequence and it is a significant part of the final product.\n", "What items should manufacturers and marketers include in analyzing the percentage of domestic content in a particular product?\n", "Manufacturers and marketers should use the cost of goods sold or inventory costs of finished goods in their analysis. ", "Such costs generally are limited to the total cost of all manufacturing materials, direct manufacturing labor, and manufacturing overhead.\n", "Should manufacturers and marketers rely on information from American suppliers about the amount of domestic content in the parts, components, and other elements they buy and use for their final products?\n", "If given in good faith, manufacturers and marketers can rely on information from suppliers about the domestic content in the parts, components, and other elements they produce. ", "Rather than assume that the input is 100 percent U.S.-made, however, manufacturers and marketers would be wise to ask the supplier for specific information about the percentage of U.S. content before they make a U.S. origin claim.\n", "Example: A company manufactures food processors in its U.S. plant, making most of the parts, including the housing and blade, from U.S. materials. ", "The motor, which constitutes 50 percent of the food processor's total manufacturing costs, is bought from a U.S. supplier. ", "The food processor manufacturer knows that the motor is assembled in a U.S. factory. ", "Even though most of the parts of the food processor are of U.S. origin, the final assembly is in the U.S., and the motor is assembled in the U.S., the food processor is not considered \"all or virtually all\" American-made if the motor itself is made of imported parts that constitute a significant percentage of the appliance's total manufacturing cost. ", "Before claiming the product is Made in USA, this manufacturer should look to its motor supplier for more specific information about the motor's origin. ", "Example: On its purchase order, a company states: \"Our company requires that suppliers certify the percentage of U.S. content in products supplied to us. ", "If you are unable or unwilling to make such certification, we will not purchase from you.", "\" ", "Appearing under this statement is the sentence, \"We certify that our ___ have at least ___% U.S. content,\" with space for the supplier to fill in the name of the product and its percentage of U.S. content. ", "The company generally could rely on a certification like this to determine the appropriate country-of-origin designation for its product.\n", "How far back in the manufacturing process should manufacturers and marketers look?\n", "To determine the percentage of U.S. content, manufacturers and marketers should look back far enough in the manufacturing process to be reasonably sure that any significant foreign content has been included in their assessment of foreign costs. ", "Foreign content incorporated early in the manufacturing process often will be less significant to consumers than content that is a direct part of the finished product or the parts or components produced by the immediate supplier.\n", "Example: ", "The steel used to make a single component of a complex product (for example, the steel used in the case of a computer's floppy drive) is an early input into the computer's manufacture, and is likely to constitute a very small portion of the final product's total cost. ", "On the other hand, the steel in a product like a pipe or a wrench is a direct and significant input. ", "Whether the steel in a pipe or wrench is imported would be a significant factor in evaluating whether the finished product is \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S.\nAre raw materials included in the evaluation of whether a product is \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S.?\n", "It depends on how much of the product's cost the raw materials make up and how far removed from the finished product they are.\n", "Example: If the gold in a gold ring is imported, an unqualified Made in USA claim for the ring is deceptive. ", "That's because of the significant value the gold is likely to represent relative to the finished product, and because the gold - an integral component - is only one step back from the finished article. ", "By contrast, consider the plastic in the plastic case of a clock radio otherwise made in the U.S. of U.S.-made components. ", "If the plastic case was made from imported petroleum, a Made in USA claim is likely to be appropriate because the petroleum is far enough removed from the finished product, and is an insignificant part of it as well.\n", "Qualified Claims\n", "What is a qualified Made in USA claim?\n", "A qualified Made in USA claim describes the extent, amount or type of a product's domestic content or processing; it indicates that the product isn't entirely of domestic origin.\n", "Example: \"60% U.S. content.\" ", "\"Made in USA of U.S. and imported parts.\" ", "\"Couch assembled in USA from Italian Leather and Mexican Frame.", "\"\n", "When is a qualified Made in USA claim appropriate?\n", "A qualified Made in USA claim is appropriate for products that include U.S. content or processing but don't meet the criteria for making an unqualified Made in USA claim. ", "Because even qualified claims may imply more domestic content than exists, manufacturers or marketers must exercise care when making these claims. ", "That is, avoid qualified claims unless the product has a significant amount of U.S. content or U.S. processing. ", "A qualified Made in USA claim, like an unqualified claim, must be truthful and substantiated.\n", "Example: An exercise treadmill is assembled in the U.S. ", "The assembly represents significant work and constitutes a \"substantial transformation\" (a term used by the U.S. Customs Service). ", "All of the treadmill's major parts, including the motor, frame, and electronic display, are imported. ", "A few of its incidental parts, such as the handle bar covers, the plastic on/off power key, and the treadmill mat, are manufactured in the U.S. ", "Together, these parts account for approximately three percent of the total cost of all the parts. ", "Because the value of the U.S.-made parts is negligible compared to the value of all the parts, a claim on the treadmill that it is \"Made in USA of U.S. and Imported Parts\" is deceptive. ", "A claim like \"Made in U.S. from Imported Parts\" or \"Assembled in U.S.A.\" would not be deceptive.\n", "U.S. origin claims for specific processes or parts\nClaims that a particular manufacturing or other process was performed in the U.S. or that a particular part was manufactured in the U.S. must be truthful, substantiated, and clearly refer to the specific process or part, not to the general manufacture of the product, to avoid implying more U.S. content than exists.\n", "Manufacturers and marketers should be cautious about using general terms, such as \"produced,\" \"created\" or \"manufactured\" in the U.S. Words like these are unlikely to convey a message limited to a particular process. ", "Additional qualification probably is necessary to describe a product that is not \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S.\n", "In addition, if a product is of foreign origin (that is, it has been substantially transformed abroad), manufacturers and marketers also should make sure they satisfy Customs' markings statute and regulations that require such products to be marked with a foreign country of origin. ", "Further, Customs requires the foreign country of origin to be preceded by \"Made in,\" \"Product of,\" or words of similar meaning when any city or location that is not the country of origin appears on the product.\n", "Example: A company designs a product in New York City and sends the blueprint to a factory in Finland for manufacturing. ", "It labels the product \"Designed in USA - Made in Finland.", "\" ", "Such a specific processing claim would not lead a reasonable consumer to believe that the whole product was made in the U.S. ", "The Customs Service requires the product to be marked \"Made in,\" or \"Product of\" Finland since the product is of Finnish origin and the claim refers to the U.S. Examples of other specific processing claims are: \"Bound in U.S. - Printed in Turkey.", "\" \"", "Hand carved in U.S. - Wood from Philippines.\" ", "\"Software written in U.S. - Disk made in India.\" ", "\"Painted and fired in USA. ", "Blanks made in (foreign country of origin).", "\" ", "Example: A company advertises its product, which was invented in Seattle and manufactured in Bangladesh, as \"Created in USA.", "\" ", "This claim is deceptive because consumers are likely to interpret the term \"Created\" as Made in USA - an unqualified U.S. origin claim.

", "Example: A product is advertised as having \"twice as much U.S. content as before.", "\" ", "The U.S. content in the product has been increased from 2 percent in the previous version to 4 percent in the current version. ", "This comparative claim is deceptive because the difference between the U.S. content in the current and previous version of the product are insignificant.\n", "Assembled in USA Claims\n", "A product that includes foreign components may be called \"Assembled in USA\" without qualification when its principal assembly takes place in the U.S. and the assembly is substantial. ", "For the \"assembly\" claim to be valid, the product's last \"substantial transformation\" also should have occurred in the U.S. ", "That's why a \"screwdriver\" assembly in the U.S. of foreign components into a final product at the end of the manufacturing process doesn't usually qualify for the \"Assembled in USA\" claim.\n", "Example: ", "A lawn mower, composed of all domestic parts except for the cable sheathing, flywheel, wheel rims and air filter (15 to 20 percent foreign content) is assembled in the U.S. ", "An \"Assembled in USA\" claim is appropriate. ", "Example: All the major components of a computer, including the motherboard and hard drive, are imported. ", "The computer's components then are put together in a simple \"screwdriver\" operation in the U.S., are not substantially transformed under the Customs Standard, and must be marked with a foreign country of origin.

This publication offers practical guidance on Made in USA claims.\nIntroduction\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is charged with preventing deception and unfairness in the marketplace. The FTC Act gives the Commission the power to bring law enforcement actions against false or misleading claims that a product is of U.S. origin. Traditionally, the Commission has required that a product advertised as Made in USA be \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S. After a comprehensive review of Made in USA and other U.S. origin claims in product advertising and labeling, the Commission announced in December 1997 that it would retain the \"all or virtually all\" standard. The Commission also issued an Enforcement Policy Statement on U.S. Origin Claims to provide guidance to marketers who want to make an unqualified Made in USA claim under the \"all or virtually all\" standard and those who want to make a qualified Made in USA claim.\nThis publication provides additional guidance about how to comply with the \"all or virtually all\" standard. It also offers some general information about the U.S. Customs Service's requirement that all products of foreign origin imported into the U.S. be marked with the name of the country of origin.\nThis publication is the Federal Trade Commission staff's view of the law's requirements. It is not binding on the Commission. The Enforcement Policy Statement issued by the FTC is at the end of the publication.\nBasic Information About Made In USA Claims\nMust U.S. content be disclosed on products sold in the U.S.?\nU.S. content must be disclosed on automobiles and textile, wool, and fur products. There's no law that requires most other products sold in the U.S. to be marked or labeled Made in USA or have any other disclosure about their amount of U.S. content. However, manufacturers and marketers who choose to make claims about the amount of U.S. content in their products must comply with the FTC's Made in USA policy.\nWhat products does the FTC's Made in USA policy apply to?\nThe policy applies to all products advertised or sold in the U.S., except for those specifically subject to country-of-origin labeling by other laws. Other countries may have their own country-of-origin marking requirements. As a result, exporters should determine whether the country to which they are exporting imposes such requirements.\nWhat kinds of claims does the Enforcement Policy Statement apply to?\nThe Enforcement Policy Statement applies to U.S. origin claims that appear on products and labeling, advertising, and other promotional materials. It also applies to all other forms of marketing, including marketing through digital or electronic mechanisms, such as Internet or e-mail.\nA Made in USA claim can be express or implied.\nExamples of express claims: Made in USA. \"Our products are American-made.\" \"USA.\"\nIn identifying implied claims, the Commission focuses on the overall impression of the advertising, label, or promotional material. Depending on the context, U.S. symbols or geographic references (for example, U.S. flags, outlines of U.S. maps, or references to U.S. locations of headquarters or factories) may convey a claim of U.S. origin either by themselves, or in conjunction with other phrases or images.\nExample: A company promotes its product in an ad that features a manager describing the \"true American quality\" of the work produced at the company's American factory. Although there is no express representation that the company's product is made in the U.S., the overall - or net - impression the ad is likely to convey to consumers is that the product is of U.S. origin.\nBrand names and trademarks\nOrdinarily, the Commission will not consider a manufacturer or marketer's use of an American brand name or trademark by itself as a U.S. origin claim. Similarly, the Commission is not likely to interpret the mere listing of a company's U.S. address on a package label in a non-prominent way as a claim of U.S. origin.\nExample: A product is manufactured abroad by a well-known U.S. company. The fact that the company is headquartered in the U.S. also is widely known. Company pamphlets for its foreign-made product prominently feature its brand name. Assuming that the brand name does not specifically denote U.S. origin (that is, the brand name is not \"Made in America, Inc.\"), using the brand name by itself does not constitute a claim of U.S. origin.\nRepresentations about entire product lines\nManufacturers and marketers should not indicate, either expressly or implicitly, that a whole product line is of U.S. origin (\"Our products are made in USA\") when only some products in the product line are made in the U.S. according to the \"all or virtually all\" standard.\nDoes the FTC pre-approve Made in USA claims?\nThe Commission does not pre-approve advertising or labeling claims. A company doesn't need approval from the Commission before making a Made in USA claim. As with most other advertising claims, a manufacturer or marketer may make any claim as long as it is truthful and substantiated.\nThe Standard For Unqualified Made In USA Claims\nWhat is the standard for a product to be called Made in USA without qualification?\nFor a product to be called Made in USA, or claimed to be of domestic origin without qualifications or limits on the claim, the product must be \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S. The term \"United States,\" as referred to in the Enforcement Policy Statement, includes the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories and possessions.\nWhat does \"all or virtually all\" mean?\n\"All or virtually all\" means that all significant parts and processing that go into the product must be of U.S. origin. That is, the product should contain no - or negligible - foreign content.\nWhat substantiation is required for a Made in USA claim?\nWhen a manufacturer or marketer makes an unqualified claim that a product is Made in USA, it should have - and rely on - a \"reasonable basis\" to support the claim at the time it is made. This means a manufacturer or marketer needs competent and reliable evidence to back up the claim that its product is \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S.\nWhat factors does the Commission consider to determine whether a product is \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S.?\nThe product's final assembly or processing must take place in the U.S. The Commission then considers other factors, including how much of the product's total manufacturing costs can be assigned to U.S. parts and processing, and how far removed any foreign content is from the finished product. In some instances, only a small portion of the total manufacturing costs are attributable to foreign processing, but that processing represents a significant amount of the product's overall processing. The same could be true for some foreign parts. In these cases, the foreign content (processing or parts) is more than negligible, and, as a result, unqualified claims are inappropriate.\nExample: A company produces propane barbecue grills at a plant in Nevada. The product's major components include the gas valve, burner and aluminum housing, each of which is made in the U.S. The grill's knobs and tubing are imported from Mexico. An unqualified Made in USA claim is not likely to be deceptive because the knobs and tubing make up a negligible portion of the product's total manufacturing costs and are insignificant parts of the final product. Example: A table lamp is assembled in the U.S. from American-made brass, an American-made Tiffany-style lampshade, and an imported base. The base accounts for a small percent of the total cost of making the lamp. An unqualified Made in USA claim is deceptive for two reasons: The base is not far enough removed in the manufacturing process from the finished product to be of little consequence and it is a significant part of the final product.\nWhat items should manufacturers and marketers include in analyzing the percentage of domestic content in a particular product?\nManufacturers and marketers should use the cost of goods sold or inventory costs of finished goods in their analysis. Such costs generally are limited to the total cost of all manufacturing materials, direct manufacturing labor, and manufacturing overhead.\nShould manufacturers and marketers rely on information from American suppliers about the amount of domestic content in the parts, components, and other elements they buy and use for their final products?\nIf given in good faith, manufacturers and marketers can rely on information from suppliers about the domestic content in the parts, components, and other elements they produce. Rather than assume that the input is 100 percent U.S.-made, however, manufacturers and marketers would be wise to ask the supplier for specific information about the percentage of U.S. content before they make a U.S. origin claim.\nExample: A company manufactures food processors in its U.S. plant, making most of the parts, including the housing and blade, from U.S. materials. The motor, which constitutes 50 percent of the food processor's total manufacturing costs, is bought from a U.S. supplier. The food processor manufacturer knows that the motor is assembled in a U.S. factory. Even though most of the parts of the food processor are of U.S. origin, the final assembly is in the U.S., and the motor is assembled in the U.S., the food processor is not considered \"all or virtually all\" American-made if the motor itself is made of imported parts that constitute a significant percentage of the appliance's total manufacturing cost. Before claiming the product is Made in USA, this manufacturer should look to its motor supplier for more specific information about the motor's origin. Example: On its purchase order, a company states: \"Our company requires that suppliers certify the percentage of U.S. content in products supplied to us. If you are unable or unwilling to make such certification, we will not purchase from you.\" Appearing under this statement is the sentence, \"We certify that our ___ have at least ___% U.S. content,\" with space for the supplier to fill in the name of the product and its percentage of U.S. content. The company generally could rely on a certification like this to determine the appropriate country-of-origin designation for its product.\nHow far back in the manufacturing process should manufacturers and marketers look?\nTo determine the percentage of U.S. content, manufacturers and marketers should look back far enough in the manufacturing process to be reasonably sure that any significant foreign content has been included in their assessment of foreign costs. Foreign content incorporated early in the manufacturing process often will be less significant to consumers than content that is a direct part of the finished product or the parts or components produced by the immediate supplier.\nExample: The steel used to make a single component of a complex product (for example, the steel used in the case of a computer's floppy drive) is an early input into the computer's manufacture, and is likely to constitute a very small portion of the final product's total cost. On the other hand, the steel in a product like a pipe or a wrench is a direct and significant input. Whether the steel in a pipe or wrench is imported would be a significant factor in evaluating whether the finished product is \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S.\nAre raw materials included in the evaluation of whether a product is \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S.?\nIt depends on how much of the product's cost the raw materials make up and how far removed from the finished product they are.\nExample: If the gold in a gold ring is imported, an unqualified Made in USA claim for the ring is deceptive. That's because of the significant value the gold is likely to represent relative to the finished product, and because the gold - an integral component - is only one step back from the finished article. By contrast, consider the plastic in the plastic case of a clock radio otherwise made in the U.S. of U.S.-made components. If the plastic case was made from imported petroleum, a Made in USA claim is likely to be appropriate because the petroleum is far enough removed from the finished product, and is an insignificant part of it as well.\nQualified Claims\nWhat is a qualified Made in USA claim?\nA qualified Made in USA claim describes the extent, amount or type of a product's domestic content or processing; it indicates that the product isn't entirely of domestic origin.\nExample: \"60% U.S. content.\" \"Made in USA of U.S. and imported parts.\" \"Couch assembled in USA from Italian Leather and Mexican Frame.\"\nWhen is a qualified Made in USA claim appropriate?\nA qualified Made in USA claim is appropriate for products that include U.S. content or processing but don't meet the criteria for making an unqualified Made in USA claim. Because even qualified claims may imply more domestic content than exists, manufacturers or marketers must exercise care when making these claims. That is, avoid qualified claims unless the product has a significant amount of U.S. content or U.S. processing. A qualified Made in USA claim, like an unqualified claim, must be truthful and substantiated.\nExample: An exercise treadmill is assembled in the U.S. The assembly represents significant work and constitutes a \"substantial transformation\" (a term used by the U.S. Customs Service). All of the treadmill's major parts, including the motor, frame, and electronic display, are imported. A few of its incidental parts, such as the handle bar covers, the plastic on/off power key, and the treadmill mat, are manufactured in the U.S. Together, these parts account for approximately three percent of the total cost of all the parts. Because the value of the U.S.-made parts is negligible compared to the value of all the parts, a claim on the treadmill that it is \"Made in USA of U.S. and Imported Parts\" is deceptive. A claim like \"Made in U.S. from Imported Parts\" or \"Assembled in U.S.A.\" would not be deceptive.\nU.S. origin claims for specific processes or parts\nClaims that a particular manufacturing or other process was performed in the U.S. or that a particular part was manufactured in the U.S. must be truthful, substantiated, and clearly refer to the specific process or part, not to the general manufacture of the product, to avoid implying more U.S. content than exists.\nManufacturers and marketers should be cautious about using general terms, such as \"produced,\" \"created\" or \"manufactured\" in the U.S. Words like these are unlikely to convey a message limited to a particular process. Additional qualification probably is necessary to describe a product that is not \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S.\nIn addition, if a product is of foreign origin (that is, it has been substantially transformed abroad), manufacturers and marketers also should make sure they satisfy Customs' markings statute and regulations that require such products to be marked with a foreign country of origin. Further, Customs requires the foreign country of origin to be preceded by \"Made in,\" \"Product of,\" or words of similar meaning when any city or location that is not the country of origin appears on the product.\nExample: A company designs a product in New York City and sends the blueprint to a factory in Finland for manufacturing. It labels the product \"Designed in USA - Made in Finland.\" Such a specific processing claim would not lead a reasonable consumer to believe that the whole product was made in the U.S. The Customs Service requires the product to be marked \"Made in,\" or \"Product of\" Finland since the product is of Finnish origin and the claim refers to the U.S. Examples of other specific processing claims are: \"Bound in U.S. - Printed in Turkey.\" \"Hand carved in U.S. - Wood from Philippines.\" \"Software written in U.S. - Disk made in India.\" \"Painted and fired in USA. Blanks made in (foreign country of origin).\" Example: A company advertises its product, which was invented in Seattle and manufactured in Bangladesh, as \"Created in USA.\" This claim is deceptive because consumers are likely to interpret the term \"Created\" as Made in USA - an unqualified U.S. origin claim. Example: A computer imported from Korea is packaged in the U.S. in an American-made corrugated paperboard box containing only domestic materials and domestically produced expanded rigid polystyrene plastic packing. Stating Made in USA on the package would deceive consumers about the origin of the product inside. But the company could legitimately make a qualified claim, such as \"Computer Made in Korea - Packaging Made in USA.\" Example: The Acme Camera Company assembles its cameras in the U.S. The camera lenses are manufactured in the U.S., but most of the remaining parts are imported. A magazine ad for the camera is headlined \"Beware of Imported Imitations\" and states \"Other high-end camera makers use imported parts made with cheap foreign labor. But at Acme Camera, we want only the highest quality parts for our cameras and we believe in employing American workers. That's why we make all of our lenses right here in the U.S.\" This ad is likely to convey that more than a specific product part (the lens) is of U.S. origin. The marketer should be prepared to substantiate the broader U.S. origin claim conveyed to consumers viewing the ad.\nComparative Claims\nComparative claims should be truthful and substantiated, and presented in a way that makes the basis for comparison clear (for example, whether the comparison is to another leading brand or to a previous version of the same product). They should truthfully describe the U.S. content of the product and be based on a meaningful difference in U.S. content between the compared products.\nExample: An ad for cellular phones states \"We use more U.S. content than any other cellular phone manufacturer.\" The manufacturer assembles the phones in the U.S. from American and imported components and can substantiate that the difference between the U.S. content of its phones and that of the other manufacturers' phones is significant. This comparative claim is not deceptive. Example: A product is advertised as having \"twice as much U.S. content as before.\" The U.S. content in the product has been increased from 2 percent in the previous version to 4 percent in the current version. This comparative claim is deceptive because the difference between the U.S. content in the current and previous version of the product are insignificant.\nAssembled in USA Claims\nA product that includes foreign components may be called \"Assembled in USA\" without qualification when its principal assembly takes place in the U.S. and the assembly is substantial. For the \"assembly\" claim to be valid, the product's last \"substantial transformation\" also should have occurred in the U.S. That's why a \"screwdriver\" assembly in the U.S. of foreign components into a final product at the end of the manufacturing process doesn't usually qualify for the \"Assembled in USA\" claim.\nExample: A lawn mower, composed of all domestic parts except for the cable sheathing, flywheel, wheel rims and air filter (15 to 20 percent foreign content) is assembled in the U.S. An \"Assembled in USA\" claim is appropriate. Example: All the major components of a computer, including the motherboard and hard drive, are imported. The computer's components then are put together in a simple \"screwdriver\" operation in the U.S., are not substantially transformed under the Customs Standard, and must be marked with a foreign country of origin. An \"Assembled in U.S.\" claim without further qualification is deceptive.\nThe FTC and The Customs Service\nWhat is the U.S. Customs Service's jurisdiction over country-of-origin claims?\nThe Tariff Act gives Customs and the Secretary of the Treasury the power to administer the requirement that imported goods be marked with a foreign country of origin (for example, \"Made in Japan\").\nWhen an imported product incorporates materials and/or processing from more than one country, Customs considers the country of origin to be the last country in which a \"substantial transformation\" took place. Customs defines \"substantial transformation\" as a manufacturing process that results in a new and different product with a new name, character, and use that is different from that which existed before the change. Customs makes country-of-origin determinations using the \"substantial transformation\" test on a case-by-case basis. In some instances, Customs uses a \"tariff shift\" analysis, comparable to \"substantial transformation,\" to determine a product's country of origin.\nWhat is the interaction between the FTC and Customs regarding country-of-origin claims?\nEven if Customs determines that an imported product does not need a foreign country-of-origin mark, it is not necessarily permissible to promote that product as Made in USA. The FTC considers additional factors to decide whether a product can be advertised or labeled as Made in USA.\nManufacturers and marketers should check with Customs to see if they need to mark their products with the foreign country of origin. If they don't, they should look at the FTC's standard to check if they can properly make a Made in USA claim.\nThe FTC has jurisdiction over foreign origin claims on products and in packaging that are beyond the disclosures required by Customs (for example, claims that supplement a required foreign origin marking to indicate where additional processing or finishing of a product occurred).\nThe FTC also has jurisdiction over foreign origin claims in advertising and other promotional materials. Unqualified U.S. origin claims in ads or other promotional materials for products that Customs requires a foreign country-of-origin mark may mislead or confuse consumers about the product's origin. To avoid misleading consumers, marketers should clearly disclose the foreign manufacture of a product.\nExample: A television set assembled in Korea using an American-made picture tube is shipped to the U.S. The Customs Service requires the television set to be marked \"Made in Korea\" because that's where the television set was last \"substantially transformed.\" The company's World Wide Web page states \"Although our televisions are made abroad, they always contain U.S.-made picture tubes.\" This statement is not deceptive. However, making the statement \"All our picture tubes are made in the USA\" - without disclosing the foreign origin of the television's manufacture - might imply a broader claim (for example, that the television set is largely made in the U.S.) than could be substantiated. That is, if the statement and the entire ad imply that any foreign content or processing is negligible, the advertiser must substantiate that claim or net impression. The advertiser in this scenario would not be able to substantiate the implied Made in USA claim because the product was \"substantially transformed\" in Korea.\nOther Statutes\nWhat are the requirements of other federal statutes relating to country-of-origin determinations?\nTextile Fiber Products Identification Act and Wool Products Labeling Act - Require a Made in USA label on most clothing and other textile or wool household products if the final product is manufactured in the U.S. of fabric that is manufactured in the U.S., regardless of where materials earlier in the manufacturing process (for example, the yarn and fiber) came from. Textile products that are imported must be labeled as required by the Customs Service. A textile or wool product partially manufactured in the U.S. and partially manufactured in another country must be labeled to show both foreign and domestic processing.\nOn a garment with a neck, the country of origin must be disclosed on the front of a label attached to the inside center of the neck - either midway between the shoulder seams or very near another label attached to the inside center of the neck. On a garment without a neck, and on other kinds of textile products, the country of origin must appear on a conspicuous and readily accessible label on the inside or outside of the product.\nCatalogs and other mail order promotional materials for textile and wool products, including those disseminated on the Internet, must disclose whether a product is made in the U.S., imported or both.\nThe Fur Products Labeling Act requires the country of origin of imported furs to be disclosed on all labels and in all advertising. For copies of the Textile, Wool or Fur Rules and Regulations, or the new business education guide on labeling requirements, call the FTC's Consumer Response Center\n(202-382-4357). Or visit the FTC online at www.ftc.gov. Click on Consumer Protection.\nAmerican Automobile Labeling Act - Requires that each automobile manufactured on or after October 1, 1994, for sale in the U.S. bear a label disclosing where the car was assembled, the percentage of equipment that originated in the U.S. and Canada, and the country of origin of the engine and transmission. Any representation that a car marketer makes that is required by the AALA is exempt from the Commission's policy. When a company makes claims in advertising or promotional materials that go beyond the AALA requirements, it will be held to the Commission's standard. For more information, call the Consumer Programs Division of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (202-366-0846).\nBuy American Act - Requires that a product be manufactured in the U.S. of more than 50 percent U.S. parts to be considered Made in USA for government procurement purposes. For more information, review the Buy American Act at 41 U.S.C. SSSS 10a-10c, the Federal Acquisition Regulations at 48 C.F.R. Part 25, and the Trade Agreements Act at 19 U.S.C. SSSS 2501-2582.\nWhat To Do About Violations\nWhat if I suspect noncompliance with the FTC's Made in USA standard or other country-of-origin mislabeling?\nInformation about possible illegal activity helps law enforcement officials target companies whose practices warrant scrutiny. If you suspect noncompliance, contact the Division of Enforcement, Bureau of Consumer Protection, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580; (202) 326-2996 or send an e-mail to MUSA@ftc.gov. If you know about import or export fraud, call Customs' toll-free Commercial Fraud Hotline, 1-800-ITS-FAKE. Examples of fraudulent practices involving imports include removing a required foreign origin label before the product is delivered to the ultimate purchaser (with or without the improper substitution of a Made in USA label) and failing to label a product with a required country of origin.\nYou also can contact your state Attorney General and your local Better Business Bureau to report a company. Or you can refer your complaint to the National Advertising Division (NAD) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus by calling (212) 754-1320. NAD handles complaints about the truth and accuracy of national advertising. You can reach the Council of Better Business Bureaus on the web at adweb.com/adassoc17.html.\nFinally, the Lanham Act gives any person (such as a competitor) who is damaged by a false designation of origin the right to sue the party making the false claim. Consult a lawyer to see if this private right of action is an appropriate course of action for you.\nFor More Information\nThe FTC works for the consumer to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair business practices in the marketplace and to provide information to help consumers spot, stop, and avoid them.

Their power can be destroyed very easily if unfortunate things make them look more wicked.\n'They have to be careful, it can destroy their career or their Academy Award.'\nThe insight into Nancy's life comes as RadarOnline reported that the 37-year-old who worked as a production worker on Glee was battling drug addiction and Julia had tried to save her numerous times by getting her to go to rehab.\nAuthorities recovered both prescription and non-prescription drugs at the Los Angeles home.\n'Julia tried in vain over the years, even in the last six months, to get Nancy to go to rehab,' a source close to Julia reportedly told RadarOnline.\n'Nancy refused the offers and that is when she would often publicly lash out at Julia. It hurt Julia, but she knew her sister was battling addiction.'\nThe sisters' relationship became even more rocky after Nancy blasted Julia to Britain's Sun newspaper last August. She also gave a bruising interview to the New York Daily News.\nTragic: Julia Roberts' half-sister Nancy Motes killed herself in a desperate attempt to destroy the actress' career and scupper her chances of winning an Oscar at this year's Academy Awards, Conner Dilbeck, pictured, has claimed in an exclusive interview with MailOnline\nBusy woman: Roberts has been working the awards circuit for her turn in August: Osage County, which she did here on January 18 while attending the Screen Actors Guild Awards\nPlea: Conner wrote about his brother's fiance and Nancy's troubles with Julia Roberts on his Facebook page along with a photo of when John Dilbeck proposed\nAccording to Page Six, the Hollywood star was 'mortified' by the 'embarrassing' stories and wondered if her cash-strapped sister had betrayed her by selling the juicy details to the UK tabloid for money.\n\nIt's not clear if Nancy was in fact paid by The Sun for the interview.\nHowever, Conner told MailOnline Julia inflicted 'pure cruelty' on her sister and Nancy's suicide letter was a desperate attempt to expose the alleged treatment.\nAnd a friend and neighbor of Nancy Motes told MailOnline that her death was 'not a Philip Seymour Hoffman thing' but a planned suicide.\n\nConner claimed the note is eight pages long - not five as had been thought - and Julia is said to be 'terrified' about it coming out.\nConner also revealed that John Dilbeck was overcome by the 'horror' of seeing his fiance's lifeless body in the bath.\nIn a Facebook post Conner wrote: 'Nancy wanted the Truth to come out and she was Willing to Die to get her point across.'\nConner, 40, lived with Nancy and John in their apartment in Santa Monica, California for years, during which time he saw their relationship blossom.\nBut the dark side was that he claimed it gave him a front row seat to the he mistreatment he claims Nancy suffered at the hands of Julia.\nWatch the full interview on Inside Edition\n\n\n\n Emotional: Nancy Motes appeared to post aggressive messages onto her Twitter account in the weeks prior to her tragic death apparently attacking her half-sister Julia Roberts\nConner said: 'I have spent enough time with Nancy and I know enough about her that I can say from first hand experience a lot of things that have happened.'\nHe added: 'The truth is in the eight pages of her suicide letter.'\nIn a series of furious posts on Facebook, Conner railed against Julia and squarely blamed her for the tragedy.\nHe wrote: 'I am posting this as a plea to everyone to Pray for my Brother John.\n'His lovely Fiance, Nancy Motes, was driven to Take her Life yesterday because of the Pure Cruelty of her Sister, Julia Roberts (yes Ms. Pretty Woman herself), that has done everything in her power to Ruin her and my brothers lives.\n'He is overwhelmed by this horrible event and all the Turmoil Julia has subjected them too.' Speaking to MailOnline, Conner said that after his brother found his fiance's body last Sunday he called the police and then called his family in distress. Breaking into tears, he said: 'The one thing that has made it more emotional for our family than anything else is to think of the horror of my brother having to walk in their and find his dead love in the water and nothing he could do about it and how she was driven to do this.'\nOscars: Nancy Motes killed herself to scupper her sister's Oscar chances, it has been claimed. Roberts, left, stars in the film with Meryl Streep, center In the months before her death, Nancy took aim at her famous sister on Twitter and one particular tweet apparently gives weight to the claim that she was plotting to hurt the Notting Hill star in some way. Nancy's death hasn't officially been ruled a suicide as a toxicology report has not been completed but her the family said in a statement that she died of 'an apparent drug overdose.' In December, an emotional Nancy mysteriously tweeted, apparently about Julia: 'Hey Hag! Glad you f****ed with me yet? You're going to LOVE what's coming! FYI-You're an awful, hate filled old pathetic excuse for a human.'\nConner's account comes after John Fraschetti, who also knows Nancy's grieving fiance, claimed the family of the Oscar winner were now 'crying crocodile tears' over the former Glee production worker's death. He said they are only interested in manipulating public opinion after her suicide, but during her life, 'drove her to death.' Making the incendiary comments Tuesday outside Nancy and Dilbeck's home, Fraschetti said Nancy spiraled into depression after Betty Lou Motes, the mother she and Roberts shared, 'rejected' her six months ago - and that she 'just couldn't handle it anymore'. 'And then you get the actress woman who is pretending to grieve but she didn't want to deal with Nancy and made her f***ing miserable.' Nancy Motes was found dead on Sunday in a bathtub filled with water with prescription and 'illegal drugs' near her in an apparent suicide. Fraschetti claims to have seen the letter she left behind.\nFraschetti, who has known Dilbeck since he was 13, said that since her death, her family have been careful to mold a favorable public reaction. 'They are crying crocodile tears. They have taken control of this situation, but they never cared of her when she was alive,' said Fraschetti. Fraschetti said that Nancy, 'couldn't stand the rejection of her mom, who in the last six months had cut her off entirely.' Upset: Julia Roberts' mother Betty Lou Motes is seen leaving her home in Los Angeles looking frail and upset Tuesday afternoon Cut-off: Nancy Motes is pictured in this photo with Julia Roberts when the Oscar winning actress was around 22 years old\n'It hurt her that none of her family wanted to be with her. She had a miserable Christmas, truly awful, and I think she just couldn't handle it anymore.'\nFraschetti admitted that Nancy's well-documented problems with drugs and her weight had caused divisions, but claimed that to cut her off was unforgivable.\n'They didn't care when she was alive. She was a handful, and yes she had her problems, but there's a way to deal with your relatives,' said an angry Fraschetti.\nNancy's suicide note also reveals the true depths of depression that her family's rejection had sent her to.\n'It read about how much she loved and cared for her fiance and how happy he made her, but it also said how unhappy and depressed her family made her and how she couldn't cope anymore,' said Fraschetti, who said that fiance, Dilbeck, is grief stricken by Nancy's death and can't face the media.\nIndicating that the suicide note goes into detail about how hurt she felt by being ignored, Fraschetti said that Roberts and her family even put pressure on Dilbeck to delete tweets.\nBut, it was revealed last night that Nancy had apparently tweeted a string of vicious messages aimed at her Oscar winning sister, including 'Just so you all know \"America's Sweetheart\" is a B****!!' on January 20.\nThat and others were indeed deleted overnight.\n\nFriend: John Fraschetti has known Nancy Motes' fiance John Dilbeck since he was 13 and says that Julia Roberts and her family cutting off Nancy caused her suicide\n'We've got a person who is grieving so much, but then there is the other so called family who are grieving, so to speak, who want to see as little grief as possible for them,' said Fraschetti.\n'It's the rich versus the poor, the fake versus the real, he's the one who's in agony, he's the one that's genuine.'\nAnd in an apparent confirmation that she did indeed commit suicide, Fraschetti said that her death was planned, but that she didn't use heroin like Philip Seymour Hoffman.\nShe wasn't into heroin, as far as I was aware. It's not like her or John were heroin addicts. Come on, it's ridiculous.\n'I wouldn't read too much into where she did it, it wasn't in some drug den. She was dog sitting, and I imagine she did this, so she didn't have to do it at home and let John find her.'\nAnd this afternoon, Julia Roberts' grief-stricken mother looked frail and visibly shaken as she visited the Oscar-winner following the apparent suicide death of her younger daughter, Nancy Motes.\n\nDressed in a tartan hat and black jacket, Betty Lou Motes was driven by a friend from her home in Pacific Palisades to Julia's mansion in Malibu.\nThe visit came after it was reported that Nancy left a five page suicide note in which she accused her famous sibling of driving her to kill herself.\nHer fiance discovered her body, which had been dead as long as 12 hours, but a responding EMT worker recovered the extensive letter, according to the New York Daily News.\nIn the note, Nancy dedicated three pages to her tortured relationship with the Pretty Woman actress, the Daily News quoted a source close to the investigation as saying.\nGone too soon: Nancy Motes, pictured in August (left), died on Sunday from an apparent drug overdose; she is the half-sister of Julia Roberts (right)\nRage: Nancy Motes, tweeted under her husband-to-be's last name online.

But she claimed Roberts started taunting her about her weight again days after she arrived.\n\nWith her weight soaring, she finally decided to have a gastric bypass fitted.\n\nMotes said she could not afford the f20,000 fee, but rather than ask Roberts, who is worth f90million, for financial help, she took out a loan.\n\nShe had lost 7st since the operation last June and had planned on marrying in May.\nHowever, RadarOnline reported last year that Julia planned to boycott the nuptials because she didn't like the groom and didn't want to get stuck paying for the wedding.\n\n'Julia doesn't think much of Nancy's husband-to-be,' the website quoted an insider as saying. 'She's convinced he's sponging off Nancy, who doesn't have much money in the first place.'\n\nAt the time of her death, it was not known if she had mended her relationship with Julia.\n\nShe said last year: 'It's a work in progress, it's not going to be fixed overnight, nor do I think it's going to be fixed by me just getting skinny.'

He has several real estate investments, including single-family rental homes on Long Island.\nA minority stake in the New York Mets is worth as much as $5 million. He also is an investor in Juice Press, a chain of snack and smoothie shops in the Northeast.\nScaramucci earned $200,000 in income from a majority stake in Hastings Capital Group, according to his financial disclosure. That ownership share also will be sold as part of the SkyBridge deal with RON and HNA.\nAs a contributor to Fox News, Scaramucci earned about $88,000, according to his financial disclosure.\nHe has three mortgages with U.S. Bank for a total liability of $2.5 million to $7 million.\nJosh Dawsey contributed to this report.

Younger patients are more likely to have advanced stage cancer, but they live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence because they are treated aggressively, the researchers reported. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" said study lead author Dr. Samantha Hendren, an associate professor of surgery at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50,\" she added.\nHowever, Hendren said it's too soon to say whether colon cancer screening guidelines should be altered to reflect that trend.\nIn the analysis, colon cancer among younger patients was often found at an advanced stage, meaning the disease has spread to lymph nodes or other organs. \"Part of the reason for this is that these young patients are often diagnosed only after their cancers start to cause symptoms, such as anemia, bowel bleeding or a blockage in the colon,\" Hendren explained.\nDoctors should be on the lookout for these warning signs of colon cancer, she added.\nNot all bowel bleeding is caused by cancer, she said. \"Bright red bleeding with a bowel movement is usually due to hemorrhoids or fissures, but dark blood or blood mixed with the stool is a warning sign,\" Hendren said.\nPeople with a family history of colon cancer and others who are at higher risk should begin screening earlier than the age of 50, she said. \"This is already recommended, but we don't think this is happening consistently, and this is something we need to optimize,\" she added.\nThe report was published online Jan. 25 in the journal Cancer.\nDr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said the reasons for the increase in colon cancer among younger adults isn't known.\n\"It is unexplained,\" he said. \"It's not simply a change in diagnoses, it's a very real increase. There may be an effect of our environment that could be contributing to the increase.\"\nSmoking, obesity and physical inactivity are all risk factors for colon cancer, as is a poor diet, Chan said. \"When we are faced with patients who have many of these elements, we should think more about the potential of them developing colon cancer at an earlier age,\" he said.\nFor the study, Hendren and her colleagues culled federal government data on nearly 260,000 patients diagnosed with colon cancer between 1998 and 2011.\nOf these patients, nearly 15 percent were younger than 50. These patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer and more likely to have surgery than older patients (72 percent versus 63 percent). Radiation therapy was also used more often in younger patients than in older patients (53 percent versus 48 percent), the researchers found.\nYounger patients lived a little longer without a cancer recurrence, even though they tended to have more advanced cancer, Hendren said.\nFor patients under 50, about 68 percent survived five years, while about 67 percent of the patients 50 and older survived five years, she said. \"It looks like patients' young age helps them in their cancer treatment and survival,\" she added.\nThese findings raise the question of whether screening for colon cancer should begin at an earlier age, Hendren said. \"This would be a big and costly change, and I don't know whether it would help more people than it would hurt, so a lot of research would be required to understand this before any changes should be made,\" she said.\nChan noted that although the incidence of colon cancer is increasing among people under 50, the risk is still low. \"I don't think the data at this point support expanding screening to younger age groups,\" he said.\nHendren said that \"the cancer community needs to prepare for the increasing number of very young colorectal cancer survivors who will need long-term support to cope with the physical and psychological consequences of their disease and treatments.\"\nMore information\nVisit the U.S. National Cancer Institute for more on colon cancer.", "documentTitle": null, "documentUrl": null}], "set_of_highlights_in_context": [{"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSentCharIdx": 120, "sent_idx": 1, "docSentText": "An extensive analysis of recent data showed that one in every seven colorectal cancer patients was younger than 50.

(Associated Press)\nFukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant is pictured before helicopters dump water on the stricken reactor to cool overheated fuel rods inside the core in Okumamachi, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, Thursday... (Associated Press)\nFour of the troubled Fukushima Dai-ichi plant's six reactor units have seen fires, explosions or partial meltdowns in the week since the tsunami. While the reactor cores where energy is generated are a concern, water in the pools used to store used nuclear fuel are also major worries. Water in at least one fuel pool _ in the complex's Unit 3 _ is believed to be dangerously low, exposing the stored fuel rods. Without enough water, the rods may heat further and spew out radiation.\n\"We see it as an extremely serious accident,\" Yukiya Amano, the head of the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters Friday just after arriving in Tokyo. \"This is not something that just Japan should deal with, and people of the entire world should cooperate with Japan and the people in the disaster areas.\"\nFrantic efforts were made Thursday to douse a number of units with water, and authorities were preparing to repeat many of those efforts.\nFriday's smoke came from the complex's Unit 2, and its cause was not known, the nuclear safety agency said. An explosion had hit the building on Tuesday, possibly damaging a crucial cooling chamber that sits below the reactor core.\nLast week's 9.0 quake and tsunami in Japan's northeast set off the nuclear problems by knocking out power to cooling systems at the reactors. The unfolding crises have led to power shortages in Japan, forced auto and other factories to close, sending shockwaves through global manufacturing and trade, and triggered a plunge in Japanese stock prices.\nLow levels of radiation have been detected well beyond Tokyo, which is 140 miles (220 kilometers) south of the plant, but hazardous levels have been limited to the plant itself. Still, the crisis has forced thousands to evacuate and drained Tokyo's normally vibrant streets of life, its residents either leaving town or holing up in their homes.\nThe Japanese government has been slow in releasing information on the crisis, even as the troubles have multiplied. In a country where the nuclear industry has a long history of hiding its safety problems, this has left many people _ in Japan and among governments overseas _ confused and anxious.\n\"I feel a sense of dread,\" said Yukiko Morioka, 63, who has seen business dry up at her lottery ticket booth in Tokyo. \"I'm not an expert, so it's difficult to understand what's going on. That makes it scarier.\"\nA senior official with the U.N. nuclear agency said Thursday there had been \"no significant worsening\" at the nuclear plant but that the situation remained \"very serious.\" Graham Andrew told reporters in Vienna that nuclear fuel rods in two reactors were only about half covered with water, and they were also not completely submerged in a third.\nEdano said Friday that Tokyo is asking the U.S. government for help and that the two are discussing the specifics.\n\"We are coordinating with the U.S. government as to what the U.S. can provide and what people really need,\" Edano said.\nAt times, the two close allies have offered starkly differing assessments over the dangers at Fukushima. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Gregory Jazcko said Thursday that it could take days and \"possibly weeks\" to get the complex under control. He defended the U.S. decision to recommend a 50-mile (80-kilometer) evacuation zone for its citizens, wider than the 30-mile (50-kilometer) band Japan has ordered.\nCrucial to the effort to regain control over the Fukushima plant is laying a new power line to the plant, allowing operators to restore cooling systems. The operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., missed a deadline late Thursday but said Friday that workers hoped to complete the effort in 10 to 15 hours, said nuclear safety agency spokesman Minoru Ohgoda.\nBut the utility is not sure the cooling systems will still function. If they don't, electricity won't help.\nThe official death toll from the disasters stood at 6,405 as of Friday morning, with 10,259 missing, the national police agency said.\nPresident Barack Obama appeared on television to assure Americans that officials do not expect harmful amounts of radiation to reach the U.S. or its territories. He also said the U.S. was offering Japan any help it could provide.\nA utility official said Wednesday that the company has been unable to get information such as water levels and temperatures from any of the spent fuel pools in the four most troubled reactors.\nWorkers have been dumping seawater when possible to control temperatures at the plant since the quake and tsunami knocked out power to its cooling systems, but they tried even more desperate measures on Units 3 and 4.\nOn Thursday, military helicopters dumped thousands of gallons of water from huge buckets onto Unit 3, and also used military firefighting trucks normally used to extinguish fires at plane crashes.\nOfficials announced Friday they would not continue with the helicopter drops _ televised footage appeared to show much of that water blowing away _ but would continue spraying from the trucks.\nPolice said more than 452,000 people made homeless by the quake and tsunami were staying in schools and other shelters, as supplies of fuel, medicine and other necessities ran short. Both victims and aid workers appealed for more help, as the chances of finding more survivors dwindled.\nAt the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant, a core team of 180 emergency workers has been rotating out of the complex to minimize radiation exposure.\nThe storage pools need a constant source of cooling water. Even when removed from reactors, uranium rods are still extremely hot and must be cooled for months, possibly longer, to prevent them from heating up again and emitting radioactivity.\nIn Washington, the State Department warned U.S. citizens to consider leaving the country and offered voluntary evacuation to family members and dependents of U.S. personnel in the cities of Tokyo, Yokohama and Nagoya.\n___\nYamaguchi reported from Tokyo.

The staff at the New Scientist ran a small-scale test on themselves, and got some pretty astonishing results. Ten staffers laid off booze for five weeks, and saw their liver fat, blood glucose, and blood cholesterol levels all fall significantly-reducing their risk for liver disease, diabetes, and heart disease-while four staffers who kept drinking saw no changes. But it was a fairly limited experiment, offering no clue how long those effects will last. Heather Timmons at Quartz argues that such \"detoxes\" are \"useless\" in the long-term, since the body regularly clears out toxins all on its own. So instead, she recommends taking two or three consecutive days off from drinking each week, since it takes the liver a full day to recover from heavy drinking-plus, over the course of a year, that ensures as many as 150 alcohol-free days.", "query": null}

Since then, the approach has been enveloped in ethical debate, tainted by fraud and, in recent years, overshadowed by a competing technology. Most groups gave up long ago on the finicky core method - production of patient-specific embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from cloning. A quieter debate followed: do we still need 'therapeutic' cloning?\nA paper published this week1 by Shoukhrat Mitalipov, a reproductive biology specialist at the Oregon Health and Science University in Beaverton, and his colleagues is sure to rekindle that debate. Mitalipov and his team have finally created patient-specific ESCs through cloning, and they are keen to prove that the technology is worth pursuing.\nTherapeutic cloning, or somatic-cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), begins with the same process used to create Dolly, the famous cloned sheep, in 1996. A donor cell from a body tissue such as skin is fused with an unfertilized egg from which the nucleus has been removed. The egg 'reprograms' the DNA in the donor cell to an embryonic state and divides until it has reached the early, blastocyst stage. The cells are then harvested and cultured to create a stable cell line that is genetically matched to the donor and that can become almost any cell type in the human body.\nMany scientists have tried to create human SCNT cell lines; none had succeeded until now. Most infamously, Woo Suk Hwang of Seoul National University in South Korea used hundreds of human eggs to report two successes, in 2004 and 2005. Both turned out to be fabricated. Other researchers made some headway. Mitalipov created SCNT lines in monkeys2 in 2007. And Dieter Egli, a regenerative medicine specialist at the New York Stem Cell Foundation, successfully produced human SCNT lines3, but only when the egg's nucleus was left in the cell. As a result, the cells had abnormal numbers of chromosomes, limiting their use.\nMonkeying around\nMitalipov and his group began work on their new study last September, using eggs from young donors recruited through a university advertising campaign. In December, after some false starts, cells from four cloned embryos that Mitalipov had engineered began to grow. \"It looks like colonies, it looks like colonies,\" he kept thinking. Masahito Tachibana, a fertility specialist from Sendai, Japan, who is finishing a 5-year stint in Mitalipov's laboratory, nervously sectioned the 1-millimetre-wide clumps of cells and transferred them to new culture plates, where they continued to grow - evidence of success. Mitalipov cancelled his holiday plans. \"I was happy to spend Christmas culturing cells,\" he says. \"My family understood.\"\nThe success came through minor technical tweaks. The researchers used inactivated Sendai virus (known to induce fusion of cells) to unite the egg and body cells, and an electric jolt to activate embryo development. When their first attempts produced six blastocysts but no stable cell lines, they added caffeine, which protects the egg from premature activation.\nNone of these techniques is new, but the researchers tested them in various combinations in more than 1,000 monkey eggs before moving on to human cells. \"They made the right improvements to the protocol,\" says Egli. \"It's big news. It's convincing. I believe it.\"\nThe experiments took only a few months, Mitalipov says. \"People say, you did it in monkeys in 2007. Why did it take six years in humans?\" Most of the time, he says, was spent navigating US regulations on embryo research.\nThe researchers carried out a battery of tests to prove that their SCNT cells could form various cell types, including heart cells that are able to contract spontaneously.\nTheir first cell lines were created using fetal skin cells; others were derived using donor cells from an 8-month-old patient with a rare metabolic disorder called Leigh syndrome, to prove that ESCs could be made from more mature donor cells. The technique does not require prohibitive numbers of eggs: it took 15 from one donor to produce one cell line and 5 from a different donor to make another. \"The efficiency was the most impressive thing,\" says George Daley, a stem-cell expert at Children's Hospital Boston in Massachusetts.\nSuch improvements might be necessary to convince people that SCNT research is still worthwhile. Egg donors for the experiment received US$3,000-7,000 in compensation. This is expensive and, according to some bioethicists, risks creating an organ trade that preys on the poor. Because the technique requires the destruction of embryos, funds from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) cannot be used to make or study SCNT-derived cell lines, hampering further clinical research. (Mitalipov maintains a separate laboratory for NIH-funded research.)\nPublic fears that the technology might be used to create human clones are another sticking point. The research might spark \"cloning hysteria\" that opponents of stem-cell research could capitalize on, says Bernard Siegel, executive director of the Genetics Policy Institute in Palm Beach, Florida. But Mitalipov has tried without success for more than a decade to produce a monkey by cloning.

The veteran reporter, best known for investigating the Watergate break-in that led to Richard Nixon's resignation, said he had begun investigating Trump's real estate deals in New York, which he called \"more complex than the CIA.\"\nBezos, who bought the Post in 2013 from longtime owners the Graham family, has donated to both Democratic and Republican elected officials. According to the website OpenSecrets, Bezos and his wife gave $4,800 each to Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., in 2009. The couple also gave $2.5 million to support a 2012 referendum legalizing gay marraige in Washington state.\nMore recently, however, Bezos donated $2,700 this past September to Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah.\n\"He thinks I'll go after him for antitrust,\" Trump said Thursday. \"Because he's got a huge antitrust problem because he's controlling so much, Amazon is controlling so much of what they are doing.\n\"He's using The Washington Post, which is peanuts, he's using that for political purposes to save Amazon in terms of taxes and in terms of antitrust.\"\nNeither Bezos nor Amazon had any immediate comment in response to Trump's claims.\nWoodward said Wendesday that Bezos had urged the Post to run as many stories as possible about all the presidential candidates so that voters can't say they were uninformed when they select the next president.\n\"He said, 'Look, the job at the Washington Post has to be tell us everything about who the eventual nominee will be in both parties,'\" Woodward said. \"'15-part, 16-part series, 20-part series, we want to look at every part of their lives. And we're never going to get the whole story, of course, but we can get the best attainable.\"", "documentTitle": null, "documentUrl": null}], "set_of_highlights_in_context": [{"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSentCharIdx": 230, "sent_idx": 4, "docSentText": "Once again Donald Trump has kindled the fires of conspiracy.\n", "docSpanText": "Donald Trump has kindled the fires of conspiracy", "docSpanOffsets": [[241, 289]], "scuSentCharIdx": 0.0, "scuSentence": "Donald Trump seems to have a big new target in his sights: Amazon.com and its founder, Jeff Bezos.", "prefix": ""}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSentCharIdx": 291, "sent_idx": 5, "docSentText": "The soon-to-be Republican nominee for president says Jeff Bezos, the Amazon CEO who owns The Washington Post, is using the paper to attack him and the other political enemies who would force the massive online retailer to pay more in taxes.\n", "docSpanText": "says Jeff Bezos, the Amazon CEO who owns The Washington Post, is using the paper to attack him", "docSpanOffsets": [[339, 433]], "scuSentCharIdx": 0.0, "scuSentence": "Donald Trump seems to have a big new target in his sights: Amazon.com and its founder, Jeff Bezos.", "prefix": ""}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSentCharIdx": 0, "sent_idx": 0, "docSentText": " Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump lashed out at Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos Thursday, claiming that the founder of Amazon.com was using the newspaper as a tool to influence corporate tax policy.\n", "docSpanText": "Donald Trump lashed out at<HIGHLIGHT_SEP>Jeff Bezos<HIGHLIGHT_SEP>founder of Amazon.com", "docSpanOffsets": [[35, 61], [84, 94], [123, 144]], "scuSentCharIdx": 0.0, "scuSentence": "Donald Trump seems to have a big new target in his sights: Amazon.com and its founder, Jeff Bezos.", "prefix": ""}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSentCharIdx": 291, "sent_idx": 5, "docSentText": "The soon-to-be Republican nominee for president says Jeff Bezos, the Amazon CEO who owns The Washington Post, is using the paper to attack him and the other political enemies who would force the massive online retailer to pay more in taxes.\n", "docSpanText": "The soon-to-be Republican nominee for president says Jeff Bezos, the Amazon CEO who owns The Washington Post, is using the paper to attack him", "docSpanOffsets": [[291, 433]], "scuSentCharIdx": 99.0, "scuSentence": "In a Thursday interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, Trump accused Bezos of using his Washington Post to try to keep Trump out of the White House.", "prefix": "Donald Trump seems to have a big new target in his sights: Amazon.com and its founder, Jeff Bezos.

At least when it started out, it had the association with a glamorous, smooth, feminine brand,\" she added.\nColor combinations can also have powerful connotations.\nIn the UK, the Esso petrol logo features red, white and blue -- much like many national flags, including those of the United States, Great Britain and France.\n\"So this combination can result in an instinctive loyalty,\" Wright said.\nThe eye of the beholder\nThat said, perception also plays a huge role -- as seen in Wright's and Mair's different responses to Pantone 448C.\n\"Red could be seen as aggressive and demanding -- or as exhilarating and exciting,\" Wright said. \"Similarly, blue could be perceived as calming and well-thought-through -- or excessively bureaucratic and emotionless.\"\nWright sees the overwhelming color of our times as a bleak gray.\n\"Gray is the color of austerity,\" Wright said. \"And we're going to keep wearing gray until we feel better financially.\"\nThat is, unless you feel compelled to lighten things with a splash of Pantone 448C.

Use him off the bench in Games 4 and 5, when two flyball pitchers, John Lackey and Jon Lester, are scheduled to pitch.\nHeck, the Cubs will benefit even if Schwarber cannot play the field and is limited to one at-bat per game. In Game 1, Schwarber hit a double off a dominant Corey Kluber and drew a walk off the hellacious Andrew Miller. In Game 2, he drilled one RBI single off Trevor Bauer on a 3-0 count, the other off reliever Bryan Shaw after falling behind 0-2.\nHe has seen 40 pitches in nine plate appearances, a rate that would nearly have led the majors if sustained over a full season. He is hitting as if he missed no time, taking pitches inches off the plate, repeating his short, powerful swing with seemingly no effort. You hear baseball people talk about players who can roll out of bed and hit. Schwarber practically did.\n\"The professional at-bats just blow my mind,\" catcher David Ross said. \"The eye he has at the plate, taking pitches, taking walks. There is not a more impressive thing that I've seen in a long time than the Andrew Miller at-bat (Tuesday). I thought (manager) Joe (Maddon) might pinch-hit for him. Who's the idiot? Me.\"\nYet, the Cubs are the people least surprised by all this. They understand that Schwarber possesses rare offensive gifts. They know how much he cares about the club. And they saw how hard he worked to return.\n\"This guy has been running in pools, doing rehab stuff the entire summer, hoping somehow he could contribute,\" Hoyer said. \"We let him rehab in Chicago because he was such a big part of it, so great to be around.\n\"A lot of guys we wouldn't have allowed to stay here. But with him, he's such a good teammate, he wants it so badly. If he had any possibility he was going to come back and help us, he was going to do it.\"\nMost players, Ross said, would have \"checked out\" after suffering such a major injury; they would have gone home, done their rehab, played with their kids and prepared for the following season.\nSchwarber was different. Schwarber always was part of the team.\n\"All of this was for these guys in the clubhouse and our organization,\" he said. \"It wasn't for me.\"\nThe players could not help but notice.\n\"He stayed locked in when he was hurt,\" Ross said. \"Mentally, he's been competing in his mind for a long time with us.\n\"Our new weight room has all mirrors. You look in there and he was in a full sweat by the time I get to the field. He's got his day in before we start and he stays, does all his rehab, stays for the game, grinds out the game with us, cheering guys on, watching video, doing scouting reports. He's a baseball rat.\"\nCall Hollywood. Hold Wrigley. And if the doctors say OK, clear out left field.\nLights! Schwarber!
